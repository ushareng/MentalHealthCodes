"So, when you ask what the two illnesses are...they're similar in that they tend to have moodiness involved, impulsivity and self-damaging behaviors for compensatory measures. Otherwise, they're not really that similar, but they do seem to ""like"" one another and often show up in the same person...making their lives chaotic, difficult, dysfunctional, and intense. 

So, if your friend is concerned that they may have one (or both) of these illnesses, they should not be ashamed. It's definitely not their fault. They should, instead, get help from a professional...and INSIST that they are treated appropriately with the correct types of therapy and medication.",1
"In addition, people with BPD quite often have a weak self concept. They don't always know who they really are deep down inside. They may always feel like there's something missing or something wrong with them intrinsically. This can cause periods of dissociation and difficulty in maintaining a healthy sense of self esteem. They may have a weak value system (or one that is missing entirely) or find that they have a difficult time adhering to whatever value system they do have. Since there's a real issue with trusting and black/white thinking, they don't always trust in their own decisions and may do things to get people to ""like"" them or not leave them that would be against their value system normally, and think that they (themselves) are terrible/bad/evil people for doing it later. They often take their mistakes in life much more seriously than other people. A ""normal"" person may make the same mistake and feel bad about it, but it's unlikely that they will see themselves as terrible/bad/evil for having made the mistake. Oftentimes, a person with BPD would make that mistake and internalize it as a personal failure...that it happened because they (themselves) are awful/bad/wrong. This means that their self concept is much more fluid than ""normal"" people. 

Now, please keep in mind that not all BPD sufferers have every single one of these symptoms. There are definitely other symptoms that can be included in the diagnosis, but this is a pretty good start and the most common symptoms sufferers may face. People with BPD need intense therapy because they must change how they see themselves and the world around them (having a more mature, realistic viewpoint of the world that isn't all black or all white), rebuild value systems and self concepts that may be missing/aberrant, build the ability to trust others/self, and learn coping mechanisms. DBT (Dialectic Behavioral Therapy) was developed for BPD sufferers initially and has shown some positive results for sufferers who adhere to the techniques in their lives. 

Here's the thing, too. It's fairly common for Bipolar and BPD to be comorbid in a person (meaning they have both at the same time). We don't necessarily know if there's a genetic link between them, but we are beginning to think that's possible. A person suffering from both at the same time (untreated) would tend to be extremely emotional, moody, hypersensitive to criticism, untrusting, self-damaging, with highs and lows in behavior that make their lives (and the lives of those who love them) quite difficult. They are chaotic because their brain isn't working correctly due to chemical imbalances and, at the same time, their perception of themselves, other people and the world is one based on distrust and fear of being abandoned or rejected. They tend to have problems with love relationships, friendships, family relationships, and relationships with coworkers. Quite often, they end up being in the hospital for suicidal ideations or for mania (more often for depression than mania). It's not uncommon for them to end up in the system for some time before they get a proper and correct diagnosis (and a good treatment plan). They may get kicked out of the system early with a misdiagnosis which leads to poor management of symptoms and relapsing.",1
"Borderline Personality Disorder, like all other personality disorders, is an abnormal way of perceiving and interacting with the world. Think of it as having a dirty filter that the sufferer sees the world through constantly. We do not believe it is caused by chemical imbalances in the brain, but it's possible that some of the symptoms might because medication *can* help some sufferers (but doesn't help everyone). Because they perceive things incorrectly, they often react inappropriately to situations that occur. People with BPD typically (not always as there is some room for deviation) have problems with emotional regulation and may react incorrectly to unexpected situations that occur. They may be perceived by others as being moody and reactive. They often have problems with trusting other people. It's believed this occurs because of unhealthy childhood experiences with parents, caregivers, teachers, and peers. However, there may also be a genetic propensity for people to have BPD as well. Regardless, they tend to have short-lived, intense relationships with lovers where they cling one minute and push away the next. They often have issues with infidelity due to a fear that they will be abandoned. There's a real fear of abandonment and rejection. They tend to have black and white thinking (things are all wrong or all good) and that means they often either idealize or villainize their lovers, depending on their mood. This leaves the lover often feelling like they don't really know what's going on or where they stand in the relationship. One minute, the lover is being adored and the next, they are being pushed away. If there's infidelity or other types of self-damaging, risky behavior occurring, the lover may eventually get fed up. Because of this behavior and their intense lack of trust, quite often...the sufferer does cause their lover to leave them. This, of course, reinforces their belief that they will always be abandoned, left, and/or alone...and the cycle of clinging/pushing away starts again with a new person usually quite soon afterward. It should be noted...This black and white thinking tends to color their perception and behavior in regards to themselves, their self esteem, their self concept, and the world around them. Quite often, they are hypersensitive to criticism (or even perceived criticism). This goes back to that deep seeded fear of being rejected or abandoned. More than likely, they lived in a household situation with a parent or caregiver who would...one minute seemingly dote on the child and the next, without obvious reason...push the child away. Inconsistent, inattentive, cold, neglectful or absentee parenting seems to be a big part of the reason a person with BPD MAY have had it develop. Since we learn to trust from the first people in our lives (usually, our parents)....if a parent proves to be untrustworthy, absent, cold, or inconsistent with affection/punishment...a child may learn that they can't trust anyone. Deep down, people with BPD don't always trust themselves, either. 

Because they tend to have very black and white thinking, they don't always handle situations very well. This ""just world"" concept where they seem to think that ""good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people"" can cause them to see themselves as bad/evil/wrong if something bad happens to them, even things they can't control. 

In addition, they often have feelings of intense anger if things don't go as they expected, especially if it deals with other people. Their expectations of other people are usually unrealistic (because their expectations of themselves and the world are unrealistic generally.) They may get physically violent or abusive when things don't go the way they expected. During a period of devaluation of their love partner, they may become violent or abusive (note: this doesn't happen with every BPD sufferer, but it is a common enough occurrence that it should be said). 

They have intense changes in feelings and react quickly to situations without always thinking things through. They can be self-damaging and impulsive. This is where people get it confused with Bipolar disease because Bipolar tends to cause highs and lows and emotional reactivity during those periods. People with BPD have this issue all the time, however...not just when they are experiencing a disease relapse from one extreme or the other.",1
"LONG ANSWER: Bipolar disease is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. It can be treated with medication and therapy. Typically people with bipolar disease have learned to compensate for it in unhealthy ways (illegal drug use, eating disorders, gambling, promiscuity, alcoholism, self harm, etc.) and therapy can assist them with overcoming these unhealthy ""coping mechanisms."" In addition, they may need therapy that assists with rebuilding family relationships that the sufferer (while in a relapse state) has damaged. Bipolar disease often causes lability of emotional response and potentially self-damaging behaviors that come from that. They tend to have periods of mania/hypomania and depression that is severe. During mania, they may feel like they have more energy, be happier (without reason), have grandiose ideas of themself and their abilities, need less sleep, be much more sexual, and engage in risky behaviors without considering the consequences. During depression, they may be suicidal, incapable of caring for themself, engage in self-harm, have a hard time leaving their house/bed, and miss a lot of work. Depending on what ""type"" of Bipolar a person has (Or where they fall on the spectrum) determines quite often how serious their periods of mania/hypomania are and how long those occur...and how serious their depressive episodes are and how long those occur. Regardless, it's a difficult situation they live with constantly. Medication, typically, works to counterbalance the chemical imbalance in their brain (or offset the symptoms) so that they can function somewhat normally without huge highs and lows.",1
"Well think of bipolar as a rollar coaster you have high and low peaks where your mood can either rapidly alternate up and down or have the longwr lasting shifts. Ups that last for days ect. Depression and anger are two of the most common. Now as for borderline personality , its more like a tilt a wirl. Your moods can go secerap directions and rapidly , impulsivness is a major part of it as well. Not making sound judgement and just doing. Not to mention reations to situations that are commonly deemed inappropriate. I myself suffer from both. And it took me along time to become stable. And somedays i still struggle with it.",1
"Believe me, I show you much more than anyone. I still have lots of work to do but I trust you completely. I hope you feel the same.  You can share anything with me Li, no worries.",1
"Yes, I feel the exact same way. My family avoids me all ways/always now. I have no place in my family and no voice either. I now choose not to give them any info if at all possible. All they do now is hurt me and leave me out of all family functions and matters because I am not strong enough. This is the time you find  your true family and friends. Facebook has helped me tremendously. I will not validate their behavior because it is so stereotypical. They choose to remain ignorant.",1
"I was hospitalized in May for the same reason. I've dealt with the loneliness that comes with it. Unless you know someone who has struggled with it, it's really hard for others to relate. Problem is, it adds to the emotional mudslide that plagues us. I completely understand where you are coming from.",1
"I feel like that and im hearing you loud okay just a while ago, only an hour or so, I wás feeling like there was nothing in this world who will ever understand my feelings. I caught it and held onto it and felt that if I didn't live it wouldn't matter. I felt so hopeless that nobody understands and to understand is to love and if I didn't have love what would I do? Die? I'm too frightened every time I try. So its not working death won't work its not our time. So what did I love? I love the world and  I want to be a part of its healing. It doesn't matter if people understand its enough that I do and the very few who know and love me understand, the rest don't matter. They are the sad ones cos they don't allow their minds to open and to accept that they maybe the ones harming us",1
"I had 9 rounds over 3.5 weeks two years ago. It saved my life. I have some trouble recalling words I need when I'm anxious, but other than that I have no negative effects. Without ECT I wouldn't be able to be at university now as bipolar had effected my cognitive ability badly - ECT reversed that. I will definitely go back for more if I go downhill again. 

Research shows that ECT has an 80% success rate; that is, 80% of patients show significant improvement. 

Ultimately it is your decision. Don't be pushed one way or another. Only you can decide.",1
"No, but I have seriously thought about having it. I don't know, maybe desperation. Have discussed it with the psychiatrist off and on...do not know",1
"Yes I do and it's terrifying, know matter how I try to explain, they see from clear glass, mine is cloudy!",1
"Michelle O'Sullivan Yes, I just started it in July.  We are moving very slowly and it takes a lot of getting used to.  She was the one who suggested I ask my brother to check in on me once in a while but I went about it all the wrong ways and got too emotional.  Then when he told me that he wouldn't tell me what he wanted to say to her I got uncomfortable like I was going to be thrown under the bus and then he got angry and just bit my head off.",1
He just upped my anti-depressant last week.  They aren't upping my lithium because the salt makes me constantly thirsty and I am a heart patient and have a fluid restriction.  I've tried every other drug and they're either bad for my heart or they have horrible side effects.  The therapy I'm learning is supposed to help with BPD but they said it will be really hard and take a lot of time to change my behavior.,1
"Yes, I've been seeing psychiatrists for nearly 30 years.  First just depression, then cyclothymia, then bipolar and anxiety, then BPD.",1
My mom is one person who sets me off when I'm agitated.  I can't take being around her.  And even when I tell her I'm agitated and we should talk another time she'll push until I snap and then make me feel guilty about it.,1
"A family session can be helpful,  you need to be ready for that though. Having a family session may allow for them to gain an improved understanding. Of your symptoms and moods.  This may also allow for you tho better understand what they are having difficulty with I  relating to you,  not as one weigh mi rather as the family you are. You are working already ight sounds like on insight sand awareness,  keep at it, try not tho be discouraged by the actions of other.  Ultimately we are responsible for our own happiness... I struggle to with relationships so I appreciate what you are dealing with.  Good luck.",1
"Yes iam like this at times but they seem to wind us up too ,its not all what we say , but I am careful at times how I speak or I dont speak at all thats easier lol , try and think before we speak ,but I know when we get stressed its hard and all sorts come tumbling out , stay strong",1
My brother sent me one: Do not disturb. I'm disturbed enough already.,1
"When I told a former employer about my bipolar, I felt like he was always nervous that I might fly into a rage at anytime. I'm not even the angry kind of bipolar; I'm really just the sad kind. But since that job, I've learned to keep it to myself. I've said that I've had a bad cold, if I was too depressed to work...",1
"The only problem I have is when I'm randomly  put on a grave yard shift. That means I can't take my meds, as they make me so tired. I have 2 kids and cant just catch up on my sleep, and end up with anxiety and not being able to sleep, from not taking my meds. Being able to have a stable and normal shift all week makes my week 100x better than it would have if all shifts were different and there were random graves.",1
"My job is just crazy. You basically do 5 jobs in one and we put people's lives on the line so we have to be 100% on our game. It's just really hard for my brain to bounce from position to position in the same day. I feel like I can't keep up and then I get anxious and start talking crap and saying things I don't really mean, I'm just saying them to try to calm down.",1
"At least you people are on meds I am WITHOUT it's a struggle everyday for me, not wanting to live cz I get into these crazy ass episodes and it's hard to control but it's easy for people that don't have this issue to tell me to fking snap out of it  ",1
"I'm a  *itch 24/7 and I am not on medication because I have no fking medical insurance for my bipolar, depression and anxiety so I have too deal with it myself and people around me, I can't stand who I am but I feel stuck like you, and hopeless",1
No i am the same way. Sometimes i cant afford to get my meds refilled and i go off the deep end. I feel so bad and my body feels so horable. It is not your fault so dont worry. Just do the best you can.,1
"No , you are not the only one that suffers from the withdrawals of these damn pills . I too become a totally different person . Call this complicated , hard to deal with , very easily annoyed that is created by these big  pharmaceutical companies and their man made so called medication. When my friends see the slightest bit of my alter ego coming out is when along with the change of myself is when my name changes as well .. I then become Evilalina ... funny yet sad ..!! Dealing with the aftermath of Evilalina sometimes puts me into a deeper depressing state of mind. I am NOT this irritate person I transform into. Which one one the main reason why I choose to medicate myself by medical marijuana . I have also knocked out 3 of my daily pills . Since Evilalina rarely makes her presence known.",1
I'm awful at remembering to take mine. I miss one day and I'm a mess. I miss two and I am completely unable to function. Anxiety induced rage is so awful..,1
"I'm going through this now. I bitch myself out and tons of negative self talk because I can't shake the guilt. I'm a miserable person to be around, even skipping one or two days. I'd like to think that meds aren't helping, since I still struggle plenty on them, but it's when I miss a dose or two that I realize they're a life saver. I wouldn't function very long in a med free state of mind. As it is, I try to limit my interactions as much as possible, so as to limit the stimuli that I will dwell on and beat myself up over. I know your struggle all too well.",1
"No, not alone I too have felt the guilt of my non-medicated self... I have to stay on meds no skipping.",1
"No, you are NOT alone.  If my meds are not properly regulated, I have blinding rage outbursts.. I am cranky & bitchy... Everything gets on my nerves... I yell like a banshee... It is horrible.... You have to stay on top of the meds.",1
"I def think it's way too much but you have to know your own body. And by the fact yiur asking, you must think so. I would talk to my dr and if he won't adjust to your wants, then get another. We are here to live lofe, not be tied and chained to meds and dr's! I understand about the sleeping, when I got off my meds 2 years ago, that was my fear. But....I researched and tried other thibgs and I now sleep 5-7 hrs a night w nothing! It's a daily task, but I fewl
So much better without all those meds, their side effects, and staying stressed having to remember to take them throughout the day. Now life is enjoyable. I'm not just going thru the motions. Good luck ❤️",1
"I too take Seroquel. It has done wonders for my sleep cycle and I now get the sleep I need. I also take a high dose of Effexor  (antidepressant) and Buspar (for anxiety). This combination works well for me and this came to from years of trying other meds that didn't have the desired results. I suffer from bipolar 2, severe depression, and anxiety. 
The amount of medication seems excessive but maybe you can eliminate some if they aren't helping you. I'm not a Dr though so make sure you stop and start your meds with Dr's guidance. Good luck to you and I hope this helps. Wishing you peace and happiness.",1
Its always hard getting a proper diagnosis. Often there are those who have more than one diagnosis. My kids have adhd bipolar with sczophernic tendicies.I myself am bipolar anxiety and ptsd insomnia so I do take a lot of pills I like u have a lot of physical conditions as well for which I take meds. The important thing is to let each doctor know what you are taking. Also be proactive know medicine side effects read up on them it gets confusing but the more u knw about them the more it's helps,1
"It's really just a matter of opinion. My therapist today said that there's two sides to depression, how you think, and the imbalance. I've been on seroquel for 8 years and due to insomnia I too only get 2-4 hours of sleep without it which is the leading cause of my issues (depression, phobia related anxiety, ADD, GAD). His way of putting it is that the prescription helps you put on a different pair of glasses until you can handle the sun again on your own. I really liked that.",1
Megan ur medication is more important that u take ur pills. They will help u stay strong. It's not anything more important than taking my pilp. I go manic offend. And it's a struggle for me when I'm like that. I get so depressed that I don't come out of my room for day other then going to the bathroom. Please thqt u medication.,1
I was told to do this and it does work but here is a technique that at psychotherapist should advise you on for it to work. I and a fear of dying but it got me through a c-section and I was allowed to keep the band on. X,1
"What I hate its like holding your breath for the worst to happen while your body is acting crazy giving you danger signals . 
Then the feeling never passes it stays with you horrible torture, tormented",1
Stress ball maybe,1
"You know whats been helping me? A fidget cube. It fits in my hand and ive been actually falling asleep with it because that's when my anxiety is the worst. Idk about the band thing, I've never heard of it, but I'm just letting you know the cube helps me, especially if you are concerned about self harm.",1
It's where you put an elastic band (like a rubber band or hair tie) on your wrist and when you start to feel anxious/nervous (or any other bad habit/emotion) you snap the band against your wrist. It didn't work for me because I have an extremely high pain tolerance.,1
"Being a partner to someone who has a mental illness must be so hard. But the things you describe are true and honest triggers for me. It's NEVER an excuse, it's a monster living in his head. I've been in relationships where I was treated bad because of my bipolar and anxiety. Now I'm married to the most calm and loving man that never makes me feel worse when I'm having an episode or being triggered by something that seems ""ridiculous."" I'm not trying to be shitty, but just because you work in mental health, doesn't mean you're equipped to live with it at home. He just needs your love and acceptance, not blame and anger.",1
Can't you put the animals in crates and close the bedroom door so you guys could sleep together? I know crate training takes time but in the end you will both come to find out the less the animals disturb your sleep the better you both feel.,1
"Firstly you are definately entitled to vent. And i can imagine it would be extremely difficult to be in that situation. Its not fair that you are working so hard and losing sleep and are clearly struggling because you're exhausted. Can you make different arangements for the animals to sleep, maybe in another room or something or maybe you could try a different sleeping arangement. I think it would be a good idea to see a psychologist or consellor for yourself as well. And try talking to him about how everything is affecting you. Maybe you could go back to the doctor or a counsellor together to try to find a way to make things work better. Its great that he has made improvements though.",1
"Has he tried therapy by chance? Therapy drained me, and I ended up dropping out. I was in group therapy, but I also have PTSD and severe anxiety along with BP. I couldn't take on hearing other's traumatic situations anymore. It did teach me coping skills and renewed coping skills I'd forgot I had tho. I've NEVER used my illness as an excuse to act out wrongly. Unfortunately I do still get flustered from time to time and have outbursts, (usually over the smallest things) before I can help myself but, I try and stop it as soon as I realize it, and I own up to it. I admit I was wrong, and apologize. For me it's about being very vigilant of myself at all times. Especially since I don't do pharmaceuticals. Perhaps therapy and learning such skills could benefit him? I'm sure he doesn't mean to be that way..it's just as exhausting for him as well, believe it or not. Wishing you strength and courage in working thru this.   ",1
"It's not fair to resort to ""leave him then"". All relationships take work and dedication through everything, hardships included. Throw a mental illness into the mix and it gets difficult to the max. 
My husband and I both suffer from mental illness and it's an almost daily struggle to not lose our shit. But we love each other. We are dedicated to each other. There are times when it feels like he doesn't understand my predicament and there's times I act like I don't understand his, But at the end of the day (or week), our love prevails.
Don't give up and just ""leave"" when there's enough love and dedication to survive through the storm. It's not easy, but nothing worth having ever is.",1
"My wife left me about 9 months ago after a 8 year relationship. decided to jist pack up and leave on Christmas without warning because she couldn't deal with my anxiety and depression. It still hurts me but it will get better, you have to believe.  Hang in there.",1
"i have mental illness, bipolar, BPD, PTSD anxiety etc etc. and my last girlfriend and i were only together for 3 years, she also has Bipolar, some days were a mess, but we loved each other increibly deeply and i loved every min we were together, sadly, loving someone isnt always enough to save a relationship from ending.  Mental illness doesnt make a person less dateable, but it can definitely add challenges.  <3  have a wonderful weekend peeps !!",1
"Yah I would coz they might struggle at times but it's worth while in the end if you love them then there ""illness"" shouldn't matter",1
Wow I can't even read anymore. How insulted I feel reading some of these comments of people so vehemently rejecting those with mental illness. Wow. Thank God I found someone who loves me and isn't afraid of me! Damn!      Utterly disappointed in the overall negative view.,1
"I myself have a mental illness, both of my parents have a mental illness, I know my father's mother had several mental illnesses. I was married to a man with bipolar and mild schizophrenia. My current husband has anxiety, but I couldn't go through a spouse with bipolar again even though I have it myself.",1
Hurtful question..n alot of insensitive comments. Its not like we can help it.  So on top of hereditary mental health issues...i have to be forever single?  That works wonders on depression n anxiety. Thanks. :'(,1
People with mental illness are jus like the next person. They jus have to take medicine. I have bipolar disorder and anxiety. A person learns to cope and people learn to be with them or give up on them.,1
Yes I can see no reason why not. Mental illness doesnt equate to danger or misery. Being an arsehole on the other hand will gauruntee misery,1
Of course.  In fact I'd rather be.  I worry about being with someone neurotypical who will either take advantage of me or end up resenting me because they don't understand.,1
My boyfriend has bipolar anxiety and anger issues so yes,1
No..I suffer from anxiety...and clinical depression...I live with it..and it would very hard to be involved with someone who has same problem.,1
I am in a relationship with my same sex partner which suffers from bipolar. Myself with depression and anxiety disorder. It's extremely tedious 90% of the time with the unpredictability of his emotions and my anxiety having a blast off that.,1
"As somebody with a lot of mental problems, of course I would. It can be difficult sometimes and it can sometimes be stressful, but I believe that if you truly love that person, an illness shouldn't stop that.",1
Shame i thought I'd married someone kind and gentle. But after working non stop. Ending up taking coke to keep me going.  I was banned from my house my buisness ended up in jail my choice to try and get help. The only one to stand by me was my daughter and she is only 12years old. It's hurts more than any thing. Yes I have depression and anxiety. But I hid it well.  Broken hearted is a understatement. But if i can help anyone going thru the same i would,1
"My husband has mental problems,thru no fault of his own,been a struggle but we are getting through it day at time   ❤",1
I was married to a paranoid schizophrenic unfortunately didn't work out cause were both ill but still great friends,1
"My boyfriend and I both struggle with mental illness so when one is down and struggling, the other who knows all too well how hard it can be and is the support system. I have cptsd and he is agoraphobic with severe anxiety, so they're both very different but we know we can always get through to the other side together",1
"Well, my wife is married to one (I suffer with depression, anxiety, and probably some other stuff), so I'd be hypocritical to say no...",1
"Married one, had a baby, he left, it got 100% worse once baby arrived. Being with someone with a mental illness is incredibly stressful and draining, waking up and being on eggshells every day/hour not knowing what mood they will be in is very challenging, especially a person who is not willing to accept their diagnosis and will not accept help.",1
"Yes because I suffer from depression/anxiety disorder. If I dated anyone ""normal"" (whatever the hell that is) I'd be bored.",1
"Doesn't sound like it's worth sticking around.  You need someone one who loves you for who you are, what you go through and how hard it is to function.  I'm in the same boat with you and am at the point where I'd be better off alone.  Just haven't figured out how to be brave enough to do 8.  No love, no compassion, no empathy.   I already feel like I'm living by myself, just with a stranger in the house.  I'm lonely and scared.  Good luck to you and GOD!!",1
"I guess I would. If they could talk about it. But myself I don't think I'm ready for one. I tried earlier in the year. But her attitude to things didn't help. I never told her about my own issues. But she belittled other peoples. That I just never went back to see her. I still have a lot of pain from a long term relationship break up. She was unfaithful, and untruthful. Accused me of doing what she was actually doing. I couldn't go out alone. So I always took one of her kids with me. They would tell me she asked if I spoke to any ladies, while we was out. If I went out with friends and she didn't come. Next day she would be checking pics on the venue or their fb accounts. If she didn't see me. I was accused of meeting someone and using the friends as excuse. (It was what she was doing)! I guess I still have feelings for her. Even thought she's drove me down into deep depressive state and I'm now showing symptoms of social anxiety disorder and paranoia. Would I want to be with someone like it? I'm really not sure. The normal me is non judgemental compassionate understanding and empathic. But the current me is struggling with my own issues. I'm not sure I could cope with another, with similar or worse issues!",1
I have bipolar and my husband has severe anxiety. We celebrated our 13th wedding anniversary two days ago.,1
"Not everyone is capable of handling the stress of being with someone with a mental illness, and that's okay. It's better to know your limits then put you and the other person in a situation neither can handle. It may seem shallow to you Nick Kemp but it's more about being realistic in what you can handle.",1
My husband has bad anxiety and is seriously insecure and he also has depression. But he's still an amazing husband and father. He's kind and funny and sweet and loving and compassionate. He never lets me go a day without making sure I know he loves me.,1
Lovely and in prision for what  ????  I suffer with depression anxiety but it dont make me do  bad things to end up in jail and cry i hav mental illness,1
"I believe it. I am 4 years older than my gf and before she was ""of age"" her mom constantly threatened to get me arrested if I did anything she did not like.",1
Would depend on what and how bad....if she were uncontrollably violent may not but to an extent don't we all have some mental illness in us??,1
"If you are at all wondering if you should go to the ER, you probably should. It's scary and I've done it. I have Bipolar II as well and anxiety disorder. I've been in behavioural units, and you're right, a lot of times its hard to even get in. I hope you feel better, I understand. Ask yourself if you feel safe. If you don't, go to the ER, they've always treated me so well there.",1
"make a list!! Its so helpful! And no worries on forgetting, see them more than once!!!!",1
I worry about what others think as well,1
Always make a list that way you won't forget. In fact my partner has a meds review tomorrow and I have already written down Two questions I need to ask. If you struggle to talk take someone whom you can talk to and get them to speak on your behalf. I have spoken on my partners behalf for 6 years. She expects me to do the right thing by her and that is what I do. Good luck.,1
My anxiety fuels my agitation and rage and that fuels my anxiety. It doesn't end. Just be very honest.,1
"Write everything down you need to tell him. This is important for your nerves will make you forget somethings. I've done it a lot and the doc needs to hear as much as you can tell him to help you. To me, remembering I'm not a doc, you have more than depression, but that's why you need to write it down, a list. The list will make you not so scared too.",1
"YES!!!!  Write it down.  Make notes.  Talk with the psychiatrist.  Please know it is not a one & done situation.  You talk to the Psy. then they assess and there is follow-up.  Please push yourself.  Be sure to share what you need.  If you find you have forgotten something, write it down for the next time.  You said your ""doctor"" diagnosed you?  If you mean your normal primary care physician, they are not qualified to make such a diagnosis. And, I sincerely hope he is not prescribing meds for the conditions without therapist or psychiatrist input. I suffer from both Anxiety & Depression, and was that same person that you describe above.  Please consider seeing a therapist/counselor, as well as the psychiatrist.  This way you get treatment and medication if you need it.",1
Hey there...you will do great!  I was terrified too and I did make some notes to bring with me but for my assessment they basically went through my history from when I started having trouble.  So you could make some notes on that esp if you're anxious but in my experience they are very understanding and make you feel at ease.  You will definitely feel better afterward and they can figure out if your diagnosis is accurate.  They can also help you learn to control the urges when you understand where they are coming from.  Remember the beginning is the scariest part and you've worked for this appointment.  You'll do fine!!,1
"Yep! My bf says he only gets 2 good weeks with me. The other 2 weeks I'm an irritable, angry, bitch, sometimes.   ",1
I have depression and anxiety and it ruined my life,1
"Yes, but you may have PMDD. I'd call your gynecologist, or if you don't have one set up an appointment, and have him/her diagnose you. I have PMDD and Bipolar, ADD, and anxiety and I get SO MUCH worse, like you do, whenever it's time for my period.",1
"Omg my periods used to be a nightmare. I was an angry anxious emotional mess. Until I got the Mirena IUD. It took about 6 months and then my periods stopped and I only have a little spotting sometimes, it's works by keeping the blood from lining in your uterus. The best part is, it only releases hormones into your uterus and not thru your bloodstream. I used to become suicidal on any other birth control. I also tried the copper IUD but it made me bleed so bad they had to take it out at the ER.",1
I have anxiety and depression and I get very moody a week prior.,1
"I don't have bipolar or bpd, but I have ADD, Anxiety, and Depression that I'm being treated for.  I used to have that same problem with my cycle that you described.  It was finally diagnosed as premenstrual dysphoria.  I was eventually diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (a very common reproductive disorder in women.  1 in 10 have it.  Many do not know about it.).  I was put on medication to treat the PCOS and the premenstrual dysphoria pretty much went away.  If you haven't been checked for PCOS or other female reproductive problems, you might want to look into those.  I include information about Premenstrual Dysphoria:  http://www.webmd.com/women/pms/premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder#1",1
That could be a horror  movie!,1

"Yes, maybe I'm manic a little more than others who are Bipolar 2, but this has been a long generated problem since before my diagnosis. Depression and anxiety came long before bipolar 2. I don't really prefer what type of sex it is, but there has to be intercourse or it's just more depressing and angering. 99% of the time, if I want someone, I'll pursue them, and I'm eerily persuasive. My sex habits have been nearly deadly, but thank god, to this day, nothing has ever happened or came up positive.",1
"obsessive behavior and no restraint is fairly common. Distraction and channeling your feelings into writing, art etc might help. Its just the way your brain chemistry works. There is no need to be ashamed just explore and try to understand how you work .",1
My onset was 15 with no adult helping me seek help. I was diagnosed bipolar at 25 but not on meds that helped the highs until I was 33. They made me so numb and I took them for 2 yrs. I hated the numb but It helped me see what I was doing to myself. Having sex with strangers was exciting in the moment but left me empty for weeks after. The meds completely took away my sex drive and I started valuing my other qualities not just my sexuality. I'm off meds now and I feel a healthier sense of self now then before.  Everyday is a new struggle but I'm happy to at least feel more in control of my sexuality,1
"I have hypersexuality. It's been a bit better with my pregabalin prescription. It takes the edge off for me. I go through phases of having a fairly normalish sex drive ( once a day ) which I class as ' wanting ' and then other phases which my sex drive is absurd ' needing ' it a few times a day. If it don't get it at either stage I get angry, upset, I watch a lot of porn. Then I have the rough sex part of it. I like being abused in the bedroom.. but according to the doctor that's a separate issue. I have an emotionally damaging childhood. The rough of it makes me feel relieved and less tense. I guess everyone is different",1
"Very brave to raise this symptom and for everyone who has posted comments of support. Its a very real and sometimes very destructive symptom of bipolar, and there should be no shame discussing it. To everyone here that has shared their experience off it, I completely understand and relate. To all those who are appalled by the subject and felt the need to comment negatively, why not just scroll past if its not relevant to you. Some of us already feel bad enough for having symptoms we can't control. Your disgust in the subject is dangerous to those struggling to understand. X x",1
I'm pretty sure your in a manic stage.   When I was manic I looked at everyone and thought they want me.  I'm a Christian and I felt so guilty about my thoughts.  It was my chemicals.  A brain is an amazing thing just look what humans can do but with that said we are full of our own chemicals so when your chemicals are off in your brain our thoughts are distorted.  My advice is call your doctor and talk to them.   God Bless.  I'm stable now and only want sex with my husband. ( I still love sex!!),1
"I had no idea this was part of my condition, no Dr or therapist ever mentioned it. They always mention drugs or alcohol, but never sex. So I was embarrassed to say anything about it. Thanks to everyone who was open to help others.",1
"I met a guy 16 years ago....he introduced me to BDSM. I never looked back. I've been on just about all the BP meds. Nothing helped so I tried to just go with it. There's no shame. When I stopped trying to live up to society's expectations and met MY own needs I felt better. I don't care what anyone thinks about my life choices either. I stopped trying to hide shit, fight and ""fix"" the way my brain works and embraced it",1
People...there's a huge difference between a dominant partner and an asshat. If they don't make you feel good it's wrong. If they hurt you and don't stop when prompted...that's wrong. A true Dom wants his sub to be happy and secure. There should be no real fear. And NEVER let another person hold your freedom. That is super wrong.,1
I went through about 12 years wanting sex of all kinds... That's when I found out I was bi sexual... And I went crazy having sex with folk guys and chicks (mainly chicks of course)... But since X'mas this year I've done it like 3 times... It's all kinda worn off now.... Which is a shame I miss it...I think about it but my fella doesn't wake up....,1
I ha e Borderline Personality Disorder and I am a recovering drug addict but the one thing that I continually obsess about is sex. Constantly. Especially if its been awhile or it wasn't satisfying....I could spend hours in bed with a woman and some women can't keep up with me. The obsession of addiction is always a part of a lot of mental disorder symptoms. I amd definitely Hyper sexual. Ive talked to my therapist about it and the only thing she says is that I should find someone who is just as hypersexual as me.....,1
"i have bipolar, and my ex girlfriend also had bipolar and she was like this.. she was a great girlfriend, but she wasnt able to be faithful for a second, she loved me, i have no doubts of it, we talked about it a lot, but she literally had no control over her sex drive, and also one of the possible symptoms of bipolar is inappropriate sexual conduct, which i myself am guilty of too at times. same as reckless driving for me on my motorcycle.. it makes me feel moire alive if u know what i mean.. all u can do is just do what u have been doing and try not to act on it if u can help it.. and be careful u dont catch a STD, other than that, a little bit of fun never killed anyone.. =P",1
"You know what else sucks? (Pun intended) always looking at someone on the street and staring at their package. It doesn't matter if it's male or female. I always look. It's horrible. My husband calls me a meat gazer and laughs about it

"SueAnna Arnold-Folsom nothing wrong with masturbation, it's normal and relieves stress",1
I work in mental health nurse a common side effect is hypersexuality it nowt b ashamed off n it's great you talk about it as we encourage this so u don't feel alone. Acting on your urges in positive way is great but should never feel guilty. There r medication if u feel it's over powering to a point it's a taking over ya mental health please do talk to ya consultant they will n do understand and a lot of people suffer u aren't alone xx,1
When I am in mania mood I can't get enough. I actually had multiple affairs that I am not proud of and it caused a divorce. I could not control it. After I did it I felt so guilty I would cry and just lay in bed depressed.,1
"Anadrol,yes,the anabolic steroid,did wonders for me. Aside from building lean muscle and cutting the fat in the waist area,going on the 8 week of hard training and taking anadrol,i masturbated or had sex once a day. After going off anadrol and while my body started producing testosterone again,i kinda found a safe and centered spot where i neither had erectile disfunctio,nor overkill sex drive. Again, i'm on lyrica,lorazepame,zoloft and onzapine,borderline bipolar and a petsistent anxious depression patient. These meds(hello Pfizer) do it for me,so there",1
but nobody ever talks about hypersexuality as a symptom. mostly out of shame.,1
"when im bad i can masturbate up to 8 times a day and the more i cum the more shame i feel to the point im just depressed, like when im in a healthy state of mind its once or twice a day, but hypersexuality can be rough. luckily the meds im on stave off a lot of those pesky side effects. otherwise id be staring at asses and crotches all day unable to think about anything but whats under the clothes.",1
Horrible it is. I could really do with one now but I can't and I'm getting annoyed with my self,1
Yeah the guilt is horrible I mastubate at least 4 times a day if I can. And I'm really guilty I just don't know why we get this feeling x,1
"Oh my gosh. The guilt??? Whenever I masturbate I get this guilty feeling in my gut, like a depressive heaviness comes over me. I can't stand that!!! Why does this hapoen???",1
I did took too many risks but not now settled and got kids so I can control that side I kinda just relive myself and then feel guilty,1
Oh wow. Me too. I'm on 2 bipolar med and 1 anxiety. And I still have sexual urges all the time. But not as bad as when I was single. At least I'm not promiscuous anymore. I took too many chances back in the day. I'm just glad I'm not having to deal with consequences like hiv.realky lucky.,1
That's the bloody problem is finding the right meds. I'm on one for bi polar and one for social anxiety and the socal anxiety ones are like bloody sex pills to mee,1
Or the time I had sex in the living room with a Marine and all of a sudden the lights came on and I realized he was filming it. I've never been so worried in my life. And that was nearly 30 years ago.,1
I have not been diagnosed with bipolar but this post really got my attention. Sounds like me and I worry when I can't control it. Can I ask what your first symptom to get you the bipolar diagnosis.  People can be addicted to sex but I too am curious of people's thoughts on this post.,1
Star Honey my temper definitely has changed. Years ago I use to get so angry. Not sure what changed it but I don't get as angry but I do find myself annoyed by the smallest things and yell at my kids and later regret it. I am on meds for depression for anxiety. My sex drive has lessened some but it seems once I find the right guy it seems to trigger the bad part again ugh. Thanks for sharing,1
"I have never needed to really use meds to control my hyper sexuality... thought I should expand. I use thought censoring during certain situations and that's about it. Otherwise I allow myself to indulge safely in what my body craves. Maybe it's because I have never viewed sex like most of society does from what most people respond like... It's not something to be ashamed of. And not talking about issues like hyper sexuality just screw people up more. Of course be careful with whatever you choose to do. But it's ultimately your choice, just practice safety in all forms ^^",1
All the people complaining about this does not understand and are most likely fakers looking for attention. this is a REAL medical condition and judging someone due to having bi-polar sex drive is horrid. YOU need to leave not the people looking for help or information.,1
It was myself who asked for the post.. Sorry but I'm really struggling atm and this was the first place I could think about asking as you all well know opening up is hard no pun intended.,1
Hey its completely ok that you feel this way. If you are in a relationship talk to your partner about your wants and needs in bed.. And talk to your counselor or Dr if you are truly worried about it.,1
"Dont worry Shaun. Its normal. My partner suffers the same way, and sadly my medication turns off my libido. But if you have an understand in partner, you can work everything out in the end. Its totally normal and you shouldn't be ashamed. Also, wanting abuse in the bedroom is purely a BDSM fetish and again, many many many people are into that sort of thing. As long as it is done in a safe, sane and consensual way, and your mental health is looked after during the process, then its perfectly fine to want that.   ",1
I go through this when I'm in mania. It's insatiable. When I'm not in mania I don't want to be touched. One extreme to the other. The abuse part is most likely a fetish. Some people desire it. Nothing to be ashamed of. This is an open group so I feel anything can be discussed and you should expect triggers. What's the point of the page if you can't talk about the problems. Defeats the purpose. Pay no mind to anyone judging you. We get that enough from society and shouldn't have to worry about it here. Good luck!,1
"I understand that. It may sound weird, but I hope that is a real thing, because i'm a worrier and question everything. While my bipolar diagnosis fits, especially when i looked at my behavior leading up to the diagnosis, It also worries me that they were wrong and I'm just a horny pervert, ya know. So, either way, whether the hypersexuality due to bipolar or a sex addiction, at least I would know I'm not alone and that I can get help.",1
Interesting article. Now my question is can you have sex drive addiction and not be bipolar. This is very real to me and I scare myself at times With the risky behaviors,1
"It actually affects my entire body when I don't get it, I'll have body spasms, and cramps, it kinda feels like a female version of blue balls, with no way to relieve it.
I go into rages if my BF doesn't want to have sex, and harm myself to try and get something out.
And even with sex, it doesn't work all the time, it feels nice, but it doesn't relieve the ache/pressure, no matter how many times we do it. It seems to have gotten worse as I've aged. I'm always either thinking about sex or death, or a mixture of the two.",1
"Wendy McMaster I only copied what the person wrote.    I have many fetishes, but wanting to be beaten to the point of death, would definitely qualify as abuse to me, and that is something I struggle with. lol",1
Haven't been diagnosed bipolar yet but they are looking at it. I am like both of you and struggle to control it. I don't have any sexually driven partners so it's just a lot of self care and sexual frustration.,1
Gosh I felt sooo uncomfortable talking to my doctor about this part of it but it not just me!   I go in waves and have hyper sexual times but the worst part is I make bad decisions when this happens.  Talking about it helps and yes it is normal for us that have this as part of our disorder.  Liking it rough and wanting marks to be left by your partner is something I enjoy looking at after the fact when he's not around.   Rough but not abuse so perhaps she just misspoke of her desire.,1
I love taking risks tho that's the problem. I wouldn't cheat as I adore my partner but the temptation is all to real.,1
I do risky behaviors when I'm manic the goal is to have less manic episodes but u gotta find a medicine that wirks,1
"Change is uncomfortable even if it's for the best. I had to learn that when staying hurts more than leaving, then you're ready to go,  even when you question yourself. Good luck to you.",1
"GO! You sound like you have planned and are sensible. Many people in abusive situations never leave or repeat the situations again and again. You are becoming an adult and it seems as though you want to break the cycle. BE PROUD OF YOURSELF! Don't give in to doubt! Don't give in to fear! Your next step is the hardest but you can do it. We all have faith in you and wish you the Very Best!!! Live your life - your parents have chosen theirs and their choices are not in your best interest........ live YOUR life and make it worthwhile. Heck, I don't even know you and I am proud of you for standing up for yourself and achieving what you have done and setting yourself up for the next step - now lift that foot up and GO!",1
"You are afraid because you grew up afraid.   When parents put fear in their children they are scared to do anything...even breathe.  You also may be scared of hurting them but if they are hurting you, you need to go.   It's the first step in a new beginning.  Do what's best for you.   You have to take care of yourself because nobody else will.",1
"Sounds to me like you have weighed your options and know what is best for you. Also, you have a support system with your boss and friends and that is going to be key during this time.

Go you have a life to lead and live. I will be praying for you and I know with your support system you can make it.",1
"I left my  abusive home life 2weeks before I was 17, I called the cops myself as I was leaving to make sure I could legally leave and everything.  However the adults involved did report that i ""ranaway"" so we went to court, I brought my best friend who helped me move and was victim to vial  threats made during the move and I brought the adult who was making sure I kept my act together - he had served over seas twice.   The judge heard both sides then I swear to you he looked at the adults I left and laughed and told them they were stupid and he told me to go continue my new life. 
**I also did not drive nor have a job **
So don't let anyone tell you you that you deserve to be beat, or mentaly or emotional  (god forbid sexually) abused.   It's scary and hard but you can do it.",1
"Feeling vulnerable at home is a common but unhealthy response to a toxic , abusive relationship. Take another supportive adult ( witness ) with you. Loudly invite them into the house so family hears it. Don't whisper. Be bold. Explain that you are leaving and taking only your things. Explain that you have discussed this with police and can call them to the house should it be necessary. Explain that you refrained from reporting the ""hit"" and can do so now if the need arises. Explain the jail time if you report and press charges. Practice saying all this numerous times in short concise sentences. Then quickly grab your stuff and go. No discussion. Have a business card for a point of contact with police. 
I am a firefighter and have done this for others before. Best of luck. God bless.",1
The comments I'm seeing on here are horrific.  I'm going to report some of these people to the admins.  They already removed someone yesterday.  You are scared because you are young and this is the life you are used to.  But you are doing the right thing for yourself.  You have to make yourself #1 in this situation-- called self-preservation.  I had to do it too but I was much older than you are.  Yes it is scary but you are so smart and doing all the right things-- and you're lucky you have so many people in your corner.  Don't stay there-- it is not a healthy environment for you.  Keep moving forward and hang in there!,1
Even if you mentioned she hit you without proof they would not have been able to do anything.  I spent years in the exact same situation.  When I got tired of it and took off my mom did report me as a runaway to save face with the rest of the family.  They ended up helping her get me back in her house.  Be prepared for anything is the only reason I tell you this.  I hope things go well and if you need encouragement and help there are people...make sure you know that when you're home and scared.  Even strangers like us are only a message away,1
Those feelings are normal. You are scared and feel alone. Those will pass. I hope all goes well for you.,1
"Tip: don't listen to your feelings when you are alone and scared. Sometimes we have to ignore our feelings and do what we KNOW is best for us. Feelings can be sorted through and resolved once we are safe and feeling secure. Hang tough, just go. Don't think, just go.",1
Just goo baby dnt feel guilty about growing.. Keep on keepin on.. You got this!! Only the toughest people go through the hardest battles.. Shine bright sunshine..,1
"I'm So sorry your having to go thru this. You seem very mature for your age and have researched and planned it well. We are supposed to be able to rely on family, but some cases, it just isn't thstvway and you must look out for yourself and your own Pyhsical and mental well being. And don't feel guilty for that! You deserve to be happy! And if you have a plan, then go for it. All the laws and stuff you billeted you are very right. My son ran away at 17 and it was that way w the law, however he ran away Bc he was using drugs and I was on a mission to keep him clean. 
There are so many good people in this world, I hope you find ones along your journey to help you! Good luck and lots of prayers! ❤️",1
"I was in a similar situation and I let the cops arrest my mom.. even though it helped me..
 It never changed her and made things very stressful on me. If i had to do it over.. I would have just left. Don't let the negative effect you,  no matter the age, take your life into your hands",1

Omg that's definitely me all day every day . It's a daily struggle,1

I was diagnosed with PTSD some yrs back it comes and goes ... Its mentally traumatic I was in a DV relationship for years but the trauma stays .. I have no trust in people I question and over think things to where I get depressed I used to hurt myself cuz I felt hate on myself and tried ending my life several times ...  I never took meds for this because I was afraid I might do something dumb ... So I've learned with therapy to overcome gradually this traumatic mental illness...,1
"I have seen therapist,  psychiatrist, psychologist s, all manner of counseling, M.D . been in six mental facility s. Taken lists of meds so long I can't begin to list them. Got so sick and damn tired of repeating and repeating my life story to strangers I just quit. The day my twenty three year old beautiful daughter died after a hospital stay of only four days , its like my head just went numb and my eyes got tunneled and I could hold only one thought. She's gone and she left behind a 2 year old, a 3 year old, and a 5 year old. I walked threw a week of going over my journals that I have written since I was old enough to know my alfabet and decided right then...fuck the professional head squeezers. Nothing up to that point was ever going to chemically balance my brain. Not even electro shock treatments could erase my history because they tried.  I had 51 years of hell that brought me to the most hellish day of my life..  Losing my daughter everyone who knew me thought I would kill myself. Not once in all my abused life did it ever occur to me to ever take my own life. It didn't occur to me then and still doesn't today. I am 56 and a half years old. In all the horrifying days since my birth from every page of every journal I ever wrote their was palpable anger as my only emotion. I take the drug Rispedol to control my anger. I have taken it for at least 28 years maybe 30. I get 10 of the lowest does xanex they make and sometimes I might have to take them all in a month sometimes only one or two if I blow out a panic attack. And I get sixty 7.5 norco pain pills a month for sever reahmatoid arthritis. In the cold set nasty months I use them all every month and still cry all night from pain. But the moral to this shitty life is this. The day my beautiful daughter died in a mental hospital thru their carelessness because they "" accidentally "" overdosed her on her fourth day...at that moment in time I was on 13 pills three times a day for every freaking mental condition all these idiot docs could come up with when all I really needed was control. I DO NOT BY ANY MEANS RECCOMMED you stop seeing your so called mental health provider. But I beg you look at your own life. Go back to your earliest memory write yourself an honest account of your life. If you like me have kept journals go back highlight the events that caused you pain, made you mad, or gave you emmence grief. Ask yourself for every event you highlight what was going threw your mind at that moment. Mental and physical pain most of all. Don't just write down the pain you felt at any given moment...write down what you wanted to do at that moment. The seconds minutes, hours, day, weeks, months, years of your torment. Were you suicideal, or homicidal, did you want to disapper.... What were you feeling at that moment. You wanted to live. For sure you wanted to live or you would not have. Then highlight after that threat of life and death was over what did you want to do after the event that  you just survived and you deal with that issue cause let me tell you know...you can't forget. Fuck forgiveness. That's not possible no matter what they tell you because you can't forget. Fuck labels. They just give it all a new name for every drug they give you. There is no closure because there is no door that can be closed that's going to make you forget. Deal only with what keeps you from living and understand this one freaking rule of life. We are born, we survive until we die. Nobody gives a shit what our real sufferings are because they feel we don't care about theirs.  Labels mean shit. Not shit! And folks writing scripts care less than anyone cause they have heard it all to the point they feel nothing but the money they get paid to pretend an interest in you. There's the truth right there",1
"Yes you can be tested. It's a very long test as well some additional questions that get asked to go with it. I know bc I was ordered to take them and thats how I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, anxiety, depression, and PTSD.",1
Jot down what you are struggling with and take it with you it helps,1
My Dr says its anxiety but I feel more like is have agoraphobia too. Its hard to figure out,1
I go to my therapist on Thursday and I wanna see if I can have a test ran to see if I have social anxiety as well because I dont do well with change and when I meet new ppl I'm distance until I get to know them,1
"There is no ""test"" for social anxiety.",1
I have anxiety disorder... I got diagnosed last month,1
"Exercise!!! Or just take a daily walk, bike ride!!! I was once where u r. I got severe depression, bipolar, 17 year old severe brain injury....I at a time thought I really don't was to have to live on medication. Where I'd always end up with totally negative consequences, by not staying on dr.s plan. Thankfully today I freaking accept my life issues an do believe in taking med.s....now the therapist has deffinately been recommended, but that I just can't find a way to go about that....maybe you could give me some insite?  Like I've gone before, with never really moving forward. I always start off by brining up my past...then that brings back all those feelings an my depression finds its way to the top. I do feel and want help, I myself have doubts as well.

Try not to put to much pressure on yourself    these dark times sometimes take a bit to get through    you will come.out the other side   baby steps don't set huge goals work towards being g m3d if that is something you are able to do    you are strong,1
"Have your MD check your thyroid, including T3 and Thyroid antibodies.  Don't let them just check TSH and T4.  Autoimmune hypothyroidism is common in women, and also occurs after giving birth.  It can cause depression and fatigue.  Also have you doc check for the MTHFR mutation.  If you have it you may need methylated B-vitamins because you body can't use the normal ones very well.  B vitamins are important to the nervous system.  Google both these things and decide for yourself.",1
"I've been on allergy shots when younger then meds since teen years. Along w a prescription asthma inhaler. 9 mo ago, after 2 rounds of antibiotics and $100 worth of otc drugs, I was still suffering. I was desperate. I tried essential oils. It's 9 mo later and I do not use meds for anything. My allergies/asthma/headaches are all controlled naturally witjout the side effects that meds have. 
We are too quick to reach for quick fixes instead of learning our bodies and being preventive.",1
"I tried without meds and ended up in the mental health ward. Not a pretty place horrible staff and even worse food they take away your phone and you get fresh air 3 times a day the beds are horrible and you end up on more meds than you went in with. If you're lucky you see a psychiatrist once a week and no councilling.
Please reconsider taking meds depression just doesn't go away it sits in the back of your mind.
Like people say you can't snap out of it it takes time meds and support.",1
"Lifestyle changes can also work! I wish soneone would have given me that option before filling me up w meds that caused so many side effects. What we eat is sooooo important, Bc food  turns to chenicals and chenicals are what control the mind. I was also told the only way to control my anxiety was meds....wrong! Exercise does way more than meds did, and without more side effects. 
Yes, I sgree Sometines people need meds to reboot, but not for a perm solution.",1
"I'm sorry you had such a bad experience. Mine was different. Staff was fantastic. I went home on fewer meds than I went in with. They didn't want us on phones so that we would be present in the healing process - it was a way to sever ties with outside stressors and provide a safe space. The food was decent. We had appointments with a nurse, a social worker, and a psychiatrist daily, as well as group. We wore street clothes, not hospital gowns (laces and strings in hoodies removed, no belts or scarves). But we didn't get fresh air. If anyone besides Kalissa reads this, please know that experiences differ by hospital, and it may not be an awful experience. Each program is different. I actually miss my time there.",1
"Have a chat with your dr and a psychologist. There are some fantastic self help treatments you can try that can really help sometimes. In my case, i used positive affirmations to change the negative nasty comments id be thinking about myself and it felt wrong and uncomfortable at first but i made a conscious effort to always pay attention to the thoughts that were going through my head and everytime a negative one came, id stop myself and force myself to think something positive instead. It took awhile but it definately helped and my mind became used to thinking the positive thoughts rather than the negative. ☺",1
"I agree. Take the meds. I tried without and believe me it does not work. I was very stubborn and it took quite a few years to realise my stupidity. You are a better Mam if you're a relaxed Mam. I ended up being a single Mam after my husband left us. My son was 6   I used to plan stuff to do all the time. So he was never bored and we had a great time together. Made some very good memories. By making plans it makes you get on with it. It's very difficult to pull yourself together and do it but by planning it gives you time to psych yourself up. I didn't want to let my son down and that's what kept me going. And believe me, meds give you the crutch to help. There is no shame in needing help, so give it some thought and try to go for it x",1
"The best advice i can give you is to always be honest with people about how you feel and what your thinking, they are looking out for your beat interest and will need to know what your needs are on your worst day and your best  days . Never be afraid to need help ,it is not a bother to ask questions or seek advice ....",1
"Sorry for sounding thick Neil Sandy but if you can't walk, how do you answer the door. You know I am a carer for my partner who has Bipolar and I suffer with severe depression and on my worst days won't even get out of bed for days or feed us as, I do all the cooking. My partner can't cook and she is a danger to herself if she tried to cook anything. EG: She put a tin of soup in the microwave to heat it. I won't speak to anyone and so how would I be able to portray that. My partner has no maths skills and cannot budget for anything. I pay all the bills, do the shopping, in fact I do everything. TBH when that day arrives which is coming soon, I have bought my rope and will leave this life as the stress of all this is slowly killing me anyway. To be plunged into debt because my ESA and partners DLA is stopped. I can't do this at all. Sorry if this has detracted from original post, really I am.",1
"I had pip on my mental status and was totally embarrassed.you have to portray yourself on your worse day,they come to check every part of the form you filled in x",1
"The most important thing is to portray yourself on your worst day, so if you can't walk at all on those days then tomorrow you don't walk. The people who come out are nice and will help you, you only need 12 out of 24 points to get full mobility component. 
Pip sounds scary for some but it's actually more basic and for those who are disabled it will pay out.",1
I am so glad people are finally understanding this as it absolute truth and there is nothing to be ashamed of!!!!,1
"There's other things to worry about then small words    I have no problem with it, and don't see why anyone would. People make a fuss out of such little things. Build a statue of the word ""bae"" and god knows someone's gonna get offended.",1
That's literally how I feel most days ..I'm struggling with medical issues as well and my self esteem is very low and my self confidence is low  I have so much self hate and hidden insecurities . I fight a daily inner battle . I fight every day not to kill myself although everything in me screams  just end it cuz no one would miss me cuz I'm worthless stupid and ugly .. I feel so hopeless and empty and alone lonley and broken . Dealing with my intense depression and anxiety is a nightmare . The hurt pain and sadness and sorrow and despair never goes away but I hide my emotions so well most ppl would never know I'm struggling so bad . I hide behind a mask . I fake so many smiles and laughs . I'm just tired I'm pretending I'm happy and ok,1
Anxiety too.,1
I internalize everything to avoid issues but in the end I end up hurt,1
Yup..thats me..id crawl through broken glass to avoid conflict..  ,1
Well this was took the words right out of my mouth . Definitely describes me . Story of my life  how I feel every day I'm feeling so much hurt pain sadness sorrow and despair but I wear a mask so it's all hidden .. I pretend I'm ok and I pretend I'm strong but inside I'm struggling and need help behind my fake smile and phony laughter and behind my sarcasm and   Sass and attitude and anger I'm fighting an inner battle that no one sees,1
"I have a memory of the bathroom in the house I grew up in being white and freezing and I hated it so much I avoided using it at night. It was actually blue. They think I experienced some trauma that I've repressed. Then again the trauma could've been that it was on the windy side of the house so cold. There's lots of reasons for false memories, but trauma is a biggie for them.",1
I have just say it's day to day things that I struggle with.  I'm not sure if it's the Lamotragine memory issues or more than that but I can genuinely argue for or against whatever it is the person is saying to me and it turns out I'm completely wrong but I'd be 100% sure I thought I was right from my memory.  It's really starting to upset me and start questioning everything...,1
Is there an admin that can remove this Brigitte person? People here don't need to be attacked for asking for help. This is why so many people are afraid to speak up. Sad. We all need to support one another.,1
"There are things that have happened in my life which I'm positive are memories but when I've asked others that were supposedly there, they say no. Some of these ""false memories"" are so vivid that I'm positive that I experienced them. But it's amazing what the mind can convince you of. It makes you question your memory on anything and everything. It's horrible.",1
Are they real or are people telling you theyre not real? Just asking because i know someone who thinks their memories are real and they are horrific. I would never imagine anyone going through these situations and they are so real to this person. Theyve found peace with god over the horrific situations however they still struggle daily.,1
Also dont made the mistake i did last month and quit during a panic attack.,1
U are not alone. I'd stick it out if you can. Just having to educate s new co working group is s ton of stress in its self. In my opinion. No one is going to take it good. Heck most of our friends and family don't   ,1
I'm just scared because the nature of my job is fairly dangerous and I don't want them to come back and say I'm not fit for the job. I've been doing the same thing at other companies for 2 years and it's my passion. I don't want to lose my job. There are no other options in that industry. I've gone through them all.,1
If ppl do stop meds good to reduce slowly and make sure ur life is stable/ stress free,1
"Retake your medication, the side affects of these tablets are horrible, I accidently never took priadel (lithium) for a few days. The pain, thoughts and withdrawal was not nice, I knew it's the tablets and got through it with help from my family. I'm never stopping priadel ever unless the doctor says.",1
You need to relax/ stay away from stress / try a massage / exercise whatever helps you. I like lavender oil. U can deal with a fair bit / don't panic bout if a relapse is coming. It prob isn't but if serious symptoms start then get help. Ps quetiapine v good for helping u relax sleep : short term use x,1
Yes it whats happens itll pass but the dreams are bizare ive seen myself in my own dream when i stopped taking risperdal i had dreams that were scary and fucked up mean you shouldnt see yourself fall on piece of glass as it goes through your neck as you bleed out in front of the glass in front off you,1
"I took myself off of my ADHD meds in 2001. I can't take antidepressants or antianxiety meds because I have severely bad side effects. I live with depression and my anxiety attacks (chest pains and panic attacks) because I don't know any way of coping or what I can take for them. I've tried seeing a psychologist but talking about my problems only brought back the memories that brought this burden upon me. In some ways it seems that my depressed state drives people away from me to where they don't want to hang out or socialize with me, which leads me to become more depressed and angry. Controlling my temper is very hard at times and I just can't help myself.
I've had thoughts of suicide but I don't have it in me to go through with it. It would hurt a lot of people, but as I continue living, I am the one with mental pain. People act or seem like they don't care or miss me. I'm sure if I just up and died, they would think a lot differently. To the ones who don't talk to me, they may see me and say they recognize me but they will not know me, for I will have changed. Every day I feel like I'm drifting further away from people and with less contact, I feel its not going to get any better.",1
"I got news:They will NOT give you the meds you need when youre preggo!!The most theyre willing to go is a low dose of zoloft or prozac!Nobody in my town would give me meds,no matter how much I begged and cried!I had to be hospitalized several times during my pregnancy for suicidal thoughts(gave birth 7 months ago.)Let me tell you....it was the WORST,MOST HORRIFYING pregnancy Ive EVER had!!It was a never ending nightmare I couldnt wake up out of!!I wouldnt wish that misery on my worst enemy!!!Im warning you!!If you are anything like me,have been taking meds since a small child,and cannot LIVE without them,DONT DO IT!!You are in for a hellish 9 months!!",1
"That is a horrible experience!! I was fine with both my kids during pregnancy not medicated!!!   I felt very great actually,but it's the after birth that I have a hard time with! My doctor is putting me on meds while I am pregnant so I don't go low or high!!!",1
yes I would talk with your psychiatrist if u r wanting to have another one.  we are working on one and I got all my meds slowly tapered off due to the risks,1
Talk your psychiatrist there are medicines that are OK.. Mine kept me on my serequel cuz the benefits outweigh the risks.. They just kept an eye on everything... If you want another baby you go girl,1
"I tried it, and I don't want to scare you or assume you're like me, but I got pregnant a few years ago. I have Bipolar II and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. There are some meds you can take when you're pregnant but it's not the same and, in my opinion, may not be healthy for a baby. I couldn't handle the pregnancy approved meds, they did nothing for me. I became so suicidal that I knew I might kill myself, even pregnant. I'll be brutally honest, I ended up getting an abortion. I'll never get pregnant again. It wasn't safe for me or the baby. I'm not judging what you feel is right, that's just my story and how hard that was on me on every level.",1
I would advise a reasonable gap between kids to make things easier. Two small kids at home would be v stressful. Care plans much better these days. An epidural helped me a lot to avoid stress/ pain which was a trigger for me. You need to organise help after the baby ie at night. If breastfeeding interferes with medication then don't do it. I had quetiapine which helped me relax after birth and sleep which is v important. Ur case may be different. As long as you know ur triggers / patterns. But it is manageable so don't worry. I was v high risk and this worked along with prayer   ,1
"If you don't feel ready, you shouldn't feel pressured into getting pregnant again. He shouldn't expect you to either.",1
"I'm also bipolar,  severe depression, anxiety. Also have Tourette syndrome. I'm currently off medication to try and start a family. It's no walk in the park. You have to take everything min. By min. But  I'm hoping it will be for the best. I hope all works out.",1
Can i ask what meds your on? I have bipolar type 2 ptsd adhd anxiety and struggling bad,1
"i am 23 weeks pregnant and doing very well without medication,my psychiatrist told me i will be fine and i started worrying about after birth and a lady from this group told me not to worry about that now and that she managed to be off meds 9months after birth,so now im  trying to enjoy my pregnancy.....i will chat to my psychiatrist closer to deliver for my option coz i wanna breastfeed",1
"You should go see a doctor, dont be scared you need the help... its okay your not alone",1
"Bipolar heightens your senses, especially hearing.  If you can't turn those things off get some ear plugs and go to a quiet room.  Sometimes the noise bothering me is the first symptom I have of a hypomanic phase.  I know it's awful.  Try asking regular doctor for a referral of someone to go to.  Sometimes they know who the good ones are.  It's nothing to be scared of and you'll be helping yourself and will feel so much better once you're on medication.  Good luck and hang in there.",1
I am sorry about the situation your in. I would not have anxiety about seeing a doc they are there to help. I have been treated for bi polar anxiety ptsd and adhd for over 20 years there are so many medications possible they can give you no one could tell you but you will feel better. And dont be afraid of being told your bi polar and you hear all these assign stories of what other bi polar people have done its not you. Try to relax in a quite place and get some help so you dont feel this way.,1
"Treatments come in many forms, Don't be scared I used to be on a multitude of meds and now I only take 3 1 temazepam for sleep .5 mg ativan as needed for anxiety and o e pain pill for my fibromyalvia and arthritis but I was very unstable for yes so I no longer drink alcohol and try to eat healthy exercise and stay away from emotionally toxic situztions",1
My friend and I take venlafaxine. And it's pretty helpful. And don't be scared of your doc they're there to help u just tell. Them. The truth u will be ok all. The best ❤️,1
"Please, go see a doctor immediately. And if one isn't available as soon as possible then  admit yourself into the nearest psychiatric hospital you can find. I understand your reservations and fears but trust me, if you wait until it's too late you will be very sorry. When I first went manic in 2013 it took less than 2 months for me to have a psychotic break. I ended up with legal trouble, busting my teeth and ruining my life for years to come simply because I refused to take medicine. Please, seek professional help immediately. You are not alone and you don't need to feel hopeless and suicidal. Sending love and positive vibes, take care of yourself... because in the end, no one can do it for us. We all have go through it, it passes and gets better. Not instantaneously, and there will always be lows and issues to conquer but every battle we face just makes us stronger. Don't give up and seek help.",1
"Quatiapine, olazapine or lithium i take quatiapine for bipolar 100mg twice a day and 3 diazapam a day for anxiety aswell and helps alot",1
Don't be scared go to the doctor they will help you. I was the same way but i finally just couldn't cope by myself. As long as i stay on my meds i feel so much better. I do have some bad days still but not as bad especially with God's help also. I will pray for you. I care about you and know exactly how you feel. If you ever need to talk just ask.,1
Pharmaceuticals not good....marijuana so much better    been on 5-6 antidepressants/anxiety all they do is make your brain foggy and some are very addictive! Pot has been a lifesaver for me.....,1
"No. That's bullshit. Marijuana is just like any other psychotropic drug - pharmaceuticals included. It can work well for some people and horribly for others. Just because something works or doesn't work for you, doesn't mean it will work or not work for others",1
"I have Borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder and freaking generalized anxiety disorder..... phew never said all that out loud to anyone but doctors.... it's exhausting, but you can be OK. There's no magic pill (I waited for a long time) and you have to force yourself to think differently (I'm not to good at that yet) but there's other people who are like you and there's people who will listen and care. I cried my entire first visit to a therapist but you need it. Trust me :) It's scary but worth it.",1
All medications require you to see a dr. The longer you leave it the worse your symptoms are going to be. You just have to push through your anxiety and make the step to see a dr.,1
Go to the Dr I suffered with anxiety and depression for years finally got help,1
"Exactly what i was thinking... im bpd, generalized and social anxiety, ptsd, etc. Was at one time on 11 meds and am now on none.",1
"I understand your pain, i just found out a few months ago i have bipolar also, i have been all my life i thought i just had ocd, panic and anixety attacks but now i find out i have pstd and bipolar too all these years i have been on the wrong meds and it was making my bipolar worse",1
You really need to see a doctor no matter how scared you are.  We all get scared and anxious. It would also be helpful to see a therapist. Hoping you feel better soon. ❤,1
Thats horrible. I cant help but think youre better off for it though...for sure. Thats the kind of perpetuating ignorance i just dont understand,1
"Please. Goto a doctor. Don't be scared. They won't hurt you. They will help you. Can understand you a lot better. 
They will listen to you and will try to help you out. Give yourself a chance. Self medication won't help you. Go for a professional treatment.",1
"Dont be scared to go to doctor there are lots of help they can give you. 
Yoga, exercise, meditation, getting lost in a hobby helps also but a doctor should be a first real step in helping",1
"please seek medical help ...we only get 1 life , i suffer anxiety and depression since my hubbys suicide    ..please dont be a statistic like he is .,,,",1
Don't be scared it seems scary at first but take one thing at a time. You do need to go see the doctor though he will prescribe the right meds dnt get discouraged Keep fighting.,1
"I'll go ahead and break my own anonymity. By writing my experience above, I'm not trying to say my life is perfect or that I don't have bad times. But through med management and positive people and activities and therapy, I've found things are much better. I still have suicidal thoughts when things get bad but not to the point of obsessing about it any more. I still make bad decisions but things are so much better than how they were and I know that no matter how bad it gets, that the bad days will pass and I can go back to being content with my life",1
"I disagree with this statement I was RAISED RIGHT but it itsnt my mothers fault if I was diagnosed with bipolar, depression and anxiety sometimes I lose my temper almost everyday dealing with ignorant people that do not understand what others go through without medication without insurance and no doctors it's a struggle point blank I was raised by the greatest mother ever R.I.P  ",1
"Actually, how you were raised has nothing to do with any of that. Some people had horrible parents and are good people. Some people have good, loving parents and are bad people. Adults think for themselves and make their own decisions.",1
"It's not about being stupid because you walk away, it can be really hard to stay when you have tried everything. I have supported my partner every single day for nearly 6 years. I have struggled with my own mental health for over 45 years with numerous suicide attempts, 1 since we met. I am 53 my partner is 29. Never assume that someone is stupid, it could be that you have done all that you can?",1
"That's every night , for those who judge fine by me but if you have a kid growing up and his/her life begins to change well after puberty wish your judgementel ass the best!! Not a day or night goes by that in someway bending me. Bipolar,Anxiety,Manic and God depression sits in days to weeks,weeks to many months before any relief!! Judge on!!",1

"Ortho tri-cyclen lo was my favorite until my insurance decided not to cover it all of a sudden after taking it for almost 8 years.. but my new one is Lutera and I love it and I'm on meds for depression, ptsd, anxiety, panic disorder and insomnia.",1
I use a Mirena. The estrogen in most birth controls sends me into wild mood swings. Mirena is progesterone and my body handles it better. I have ptsd anxiety major depression and they are tracking my moods to determine bipolar. I hope this helps,1
"Loester 24. I have the least amount of hormonal swings and have no side effects. Bipolar, anxiety, and depression is what I'm treated for. The Nuvaring also worked well.",1
Yeah nexplanon like depo have the same hormones and they have no estrogen so they shouldn't have many side effects. I think the only side effect for me was lack of sex drive. It didn't bother my depression or anxiety at all.,1
Talk to your doctor? I doubt any of us are medically qualified to give proper advice.,1
I have bipolar depression anxiety and ptsd I'm on the pill used to be depo,1
"Talk to your doctor. I have depression and anxiety, been on Logynon ED for quite a few years now and never had any problems. I was lucky in the sense that this was the 2nd pill I tried so I didn't have to go through countless prescriptions to find the right pill for me",1
Nuvaring... I'm bipolar type 2 n intense anxiety and it's great for me and been on it years,1
"I used to take the pill to prevent migraines and heavy bleeding. I struggle with taking my meds on time because of my depression. I recently talked to my gyno about this and she suggested that I switch to Mirena which is an IUD that also has a low dose of progestin. So far it has worked wonders. I don't have to worry about forgetting to take my pill and my periods have basically stopped. I have spotting for a week every couple of months but that's it.
Good luck. I hope you find something that works for you.",1
"I struggled with this concern as well. I didn't want something that was going to throw off the balance of my meds once a month. I talked in depth with my doctor about it as we agreed on the IUD (Mirena). It has the least amount of hormones with the best success rate for what I was specifically looking for. I have had three now (one after each child and then got it replaced when the 5 yrs was up). I have had very little issue with it. 
Best of luck my friend.",1

"Take your meds you need them.  You have way too many things going on in your life to be able to manage them without meds. As for your boy friend,  he is the one who bears the brunt of your behavior when you don't take them.  I don't blame him. My ex husband is borderline personality disorder and with just that life was a real struggle. He refused meds.  We're now divorced, I couldn't continue when he wouldn't let the doctors help him.",1
Ok so part of being healthy is taking your meds. Like it or not we are incurable. I makes me so sad when I see someone feel better and decide they are all fixed and quit taking their meds.   Imagine if we struggle to live with ourselves how do we expect someone else to? Take your meds.,1
"I would try to remember that, despite their best intentions loved ones who don't have these same illnesses, sometimes don't know what to do to help us. Because we love them, their opinions mean the most, and can hurt 
Us the most in times like this. I would suggest possibly  checking into couples counselling to educate him as well. 
I hear everyone who's saying stay on your meds, but I can say from experience, sometimes they make things worse, especially if we are given to many, or ones that are not working for us. I've seen amazing results with natural treatment, but that doesn't work for everyone... the worst is doctors prescribing many meds who are not specialists in this area. A good psychiatrist could help you get them balanced out, if you feel your on to many, and are not already seeing one. This is a life long struggle for so many of us, please don't give up, keep trying different things until you find what works for you. Mediation and mindfulness and DBT can also be very helpful. Wishing you the best ❤️",1
Please take your meds the side affects are way more detrimental then if you are on your meds stopping cold turkey can cause seizures and a whole array of permanent damage im not trying to scare you but I know how it feels to be zombified and sluggish and tired but you really need to speak with your physch Dr and therapist sweety and your bf is also speaking the truth I'm not being mean im just speaking reality and a long time ago I was constantly on and off my meds it was horrendous and I was a horrible nightmare and train wreck doing that I was constantly in and out of the hospital I was out of control and basically abusive to everyone in my life so please please take your meds otherwise you'll be on a darker side you've never been on and medication adjustment takes a while but once your stable trust me you will be thankful and speaking from your bfs side he just doesn't want to see your in pain and hurting yourself and do not give up and give in its not the answer sweety I know its hard and trying but you can do it your journey isn't over and once your in a great place you'll look back and realize you have conquered that dark place anyways I hope this helps sweety,1

"Early last year I allowed somebody (formerly) close to me shame me for my reliance on meds for my mental illness.I am bipolar and have complex PTSD from both child abuse and combat.I stopped for 4 months.I'm still struggling to completely come back from the damage I did to my life.It was a train wreck.So now,in addition to my core issues,I have major regret for the choices I made and the way I acted in those dark unmedicated months.Take your meds and be grateful your man loves you enough to even give you an opportunity to fix this.I,too,am blessed to have a husband who knows I am not my behavior and he's been longsuffering,believe me.Be a responsible grown-up and take your medicine.It's by far the lesser of 2 evils.",1

"You REALLY need to keep fighting and take your meds,each and every day!Im not trying to sound mean at ALL so please dont take this the wrong way,hun,but you cant blame people in your life wanting to leave if youre not on them!They honestly should not have to deal with that drama.Ive had 2 bfs leave me,several friends,and family even refuse to talk to me if Im not on my meds.But I take responsibility for my actions,and I realize what a horrible person I am when Im not on them.I am up/down every 10 minutes,happy then DANGEROUSLY angry,where Im breaking stuff and cannot control my emotions.So its no wonder why everybody left me!

Nowdays,I just take them everyday,like Im supposed to,and I refuse to stop fighting!I refuse to lose anyone else because of MY actions when Im not on them.I am a responsible person,and I want my life to get better.

Just keep in mind....when you dont take your meds,theres much more to worry about then yourself.You risk losing your loved ones.Dont make the same mistakes I did.Please keep fighting.",1
"Hello, I have been where you are. I am 38 and wasn't diagnosed until I was 33 with bi-polar 1, anxiety, and borderline. I can tell you it caused a lot of issue for me relationship wise and I wish I would of had someone back then to help me. Before I was placed on my meds I was pretty unstable , anger , moods all over the place and very impulsive. It even lead me into some legal issues. The downward spiral you are having right now is due to not being able to process the emotions at the moment correctly, and that is because you are inconsistent with your meds. Your bf threat to leave is a understandable reason for this spiral. But speaking from having been thru a similar thing before its because he wants to see you mentally healthy. If you two have been together over 5 years I am sure he has seen you at your best and your worse. My suggestion to you is to look into if you have a stabilization center near you. I have had to do it a couple times in the past. You can check yourself in as a walk in , average stay is 3-5 days. If you truly want to help yourself then becoming stable should be your priority. And once you do this ,you will see the talk from him of leaving was just his way of trying to get you to realize you need the help.",1
"I have all those same probs, n i havemt taken a pill in 3+yrs. My husband knows i have good n bad days but he still supports me in whatever i have to deal with. If u dont like pills go natural. There are tons of herbs n tinctures u can use. I managed to find a few things that help without the meds. Its trial n error. Start small and try diff things till u find something that eases most of ur symptoms. Its ur personal choice,ur life. If u dont wanna take meds then dont. But dont let ur bf pressure u into takin them jst cus. Half the meds they give u for this crap are ssri's. I recommend doing some research. As for the rest of u ppl that keep telling her to take her meds fck u. Its her fckin choice uf she wants to take them or not. U dont need pharmaceuticals to combat mental illnesses. There are many other options she can use.",1

"Try to eliminate some of the meds that are not doing anything for you and keep taking the meds that do. It can take quite a while to find which ones are right for you and what the minimum dose is that is effective. Being pressured will not leave you in a position to reduce any of your meds. Being misunderstood will make you feel worse. I have had to accept that I have to take my tablets. I have tried to stop taking them before and landed up being much worse than what I began. Work with your doctor or mental health clinic to establish which one or two tablets may be balancing the chemicals in your brain. Sometimes the onset is triggered by certain persons in your life but even if you stay away from them, you may need less meds but the imbalance will still be there albeit to a lesser degree. People who do not understand sometimes are denying their own shortcomings concerning their mental health. Good luck",1
Please take your meds. You need them. It's nothing to be ashamed about. I've come to accept that I'll need to be on meds for the rest of my life. I have bipolar II and depression. I couldn't function without my meds.,1

Some meds are necessary in order for us to have even a small quality of life in our day even if we don't want to take them or don't think they help. If you don't think they are helping though I'd definitely consult with your doctor and pharmacist as well about possibly changing them up. Remember though any changes of meds comes with an adjustment phase that can sometimes be rough.

"Married and divorced from 3 mentally abusive narcissistic cheating pathological lying ex husbands, 3 grown kids from first one who was a deadbeat dad til last couple years and the last two were mean to my kids and did drugs. I seem to have a pattern for attracting that type..... 

I'm bipolar 1, inattentive ADD, GAD, and thanks to last ex and the way our split went down, social anxiety and I believe but not diagnosed a touch of PTSD. Been hospitalized 3 times, was over medicated so bad for 6 years that since last crash and divorce 2 years ago I don't take meds like I should. I also have been unable to work since then. I was an RN.

Am now in relationship with a great man who is nothing like the creeps I'm used to. He was married to his first wife for 35 years and they divorced because she cheated and lied about it even though he already knew and had proof. He is good as gold to me but we both admit to trust issues. When this man told me he wanted to be with me, wants to get married, I was hesitant. Told him marriage ruins relationships for me and that it would just take time because words are nothing to me. He has had to prove himself to me by his actions and so far has done a very good job. He is very good to me, puts me ahead of himself all the time. We have same lock code on our phones and are free to check each others phones at random, but we rarely do. Just knowing we can helps us both though. We agree that cheating is bullshit and we are both too old (me 46 him 56) to spend any amount of time with someone we don't want to be with and dam sleeping in bed with one person and thinking about another. We agree if either of us wanted to be with someone else the other will be the first to know. We are together pretty much 24/7 right now because I work with him, we shop together and go everywhere together. I don't drive because of my anxiety so he takes me everywhere. that helps a lotI. With the trust because when does either of us have a chance to cheat when we are up each others butts day in and day out lol. I know that's not realistic for everyone and won't always be the case for us either, and its just because we are compatible and want to be together not because we are that paranoid. But I still get aggravated when he stays on his phone around me and we both still question each other a lot if there's a message or strange comment from members of opposite sex. Its hard when you've been betrayed and lied too. So don't know if that really helps much but that's how I'm dealing with it right now and you can see by mine and other peoples remarks that you are not alone. Xxx",1

I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 with OCD traits, social anxiety disorder. GAD & seasonal affective disorder. I take my meds & try to just concentrate on each day. For me looking too far ahead overwhelmes me. I was told by a doctor once that I need to think of my illness like I have diabetes. I can't be cured but I need to maintain my condition.

Thanks Curtis .. that was very supportive and encouraging. I'm glad I'm not as alone as I thought I was . I've had many failed attempts as well ..I don't know how I've survived this long either..I think about suicide a lot to and I think about how I will end my life ..I would say I would probelly  fantasize it as well at times ..when I think about it I get jealous of ppl who succeed in committing suicide becuz that could be me..I to can't wait for the day I can Rest In Peace and I doubt it will  be in this lifetime that's why I feel like suicide is my only option at times . Sad but true..yes I totally agree I can't wait till I don't have to hurt the way I hurt or feel the terrible deep intense dark feelings that I feel. It's a nightmare.. I also get jealous of those who don't suffer with mental health issues cuz I agree I definitely think it's totally unfair.its hard to accept it though.. I just started working with a new therapist once a week for a hour .. she's  been very nice and is helping me not hold in my feelings and emotions as much and working on my negative  thinking and self hate issues.. I hope it continues to be a helpful and productive therapy for me cuz it's going well so far but I've only been seeing her for maybe three weeks or so but she's been great and very supportive and she understands my struggles with depression and anxiety.. I'm trying to change my thinking when I get suicidal which is very often .. my therapist wants to make a pact with her I guess before I hurt myself or attempt suicide I have to reach out.. but thanks again for the nice message it really made my night and I'm feeling better for now . It's great to know maybe a few ppl still understand and care about what I'm going thru .. I appreciate it,1
"I think it's safer keeping those thoughts to ourselves to prevent getting locked up. You can take that either way. Legal or mental. I'd rather open up anonymously. I don't want people knowing everything that goes on inside my head. Hell, sometimes it scares me",1
If you don't belong on this site and have no respect for others that are hurting or going through things or do not understand dark thoughts which mean many different things for many different people and yes there's some things that we just should never say out loud every single person on this planet has had many types of dark thoughts trust me but as someone with a mental illness it can be much harder to Bare including just thoughts about yourself your life people in your life Etc but again if you don't understand these things you probably don't belong on this site and the truth be told you may not even have a mental illness so why the heck are you on here have a little common sense and decency and find someone else to bother only people that are struggling alone and if you do struggle in your life with anything I hope people are there for you you should not judge and I am not trying to judge you but you are certainly trying to judge in what does thoughts means from a group that is all about trying to figure out their mindset and trying to heal without Compassion or respect this is not the site for you!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
Yes I have lots of negative thoughts and suicidal thoughts but it seems lots of ppl  on Here are not understanding or supportive so it's a little upsetting especially since I'm really needing help and support  yes suicide is a very real thing thing for me,1
"What!? You're crazy! (Not in literal terms) I've spoke with a lot of nice people who share my struggles, and if they don't they're generous to talk to you. And if you feel like no ones listening to you, I'm here ☺️",1
"Suicide is very real for me as well, I am a suicidal person. I've had many failed attempts some I don't know how I survived. I idealize it on a daily basis. I'll run through my head how I'm going to do it so that next time it works. I fantasize about death and dying. When I hear of someone making a attempt and succeeding I get envious and jealous. I just long for the day when I'll actually be able to Rest In Peace and not hurt the way I hurt or feel the feelings that I do. I also get envious and jealous of people who don't have the struggles of being suicidal because sometimes I think it's not fair but I try and accept it for what it is and I work super close with my therapist once a week to try and change my thinking when I start to go down the suicide road. But for the time being I made a pact that I have to be here for my girls (dogs) because nobody will take care of them the way I do. Keep your head up beautiful and know that you are not alone and we are warriors who battle wars most people couldn't fathom fighting and we make it one day at a time. It's not a good feeling to be suicidal but it is real and there is support out there, we're not alone. Keep your chin up (((((hug)))))",1

"Every damned day! The thing is even though I have mental ill health, I am generally a happy person and I try to show it on the outside so only a few people know what goes on inside my head.

"Jules Letellier yes being mindful of my thoughts.

I feel empathy and sympathy for all the humans and animals that are out there right now suffering and being abused and I can get stuck there and it feels awful. Not so much accepting the thoughts but redirecting them to something healthier that doesn't make me feel so horrible. Like saying to myself if these thoughts aren't going to help or change things then I need to redirect my thoughts to more positive ones. It's a very hard process but I do have a wonderful therapist and I don't know where I'd be without her. Small steps   ",1

"The two of you were separated, so technically, he didn't cheat. That's the one thing he has in his favor. But he must not have very much respect for you, let alone love, if he could go out and sleep with someone else knowing the effect it would have on you. My husband actually did cheat on me. Then he came home and threw it in my face because he knew it would be the one thing that would hurt me the most. And to make matters even worse, he had the affair on New Years, which means not only will I always remember the exact day it happened, but I'll start each new year angry, hurt, and resentful. Yeah, fun for me. I can tell you from experience that it does get easier to live with. Eventually you'll reach a point where it's not the very first thing you think about when you wake up in the morning. You'll always have that brick in your chest where your heart used to be, but since it's always there, you'll get used to it and won't notice it so much anymore. But there will always be those impossible-to-answer questions that'll cause you to lose sleep at night. 

""Does he really love me?"" 
""How could he do this to me?""
""Why her?"" 
""Does he have feelings for her?"" 
""Will he do it again?"" 
""Am I an idiot for taking him back?"" 
""Does the fact that I did make me weak?""
""Is she better than me?"" 

Those questions will drive you insane at night. I understand how you feel. Like you, I love my husband more than anything, too, and it's HARD to get past a betrayal of that magnitude. Fortunately, my husband didn't get his squeeze toy pregnant, so I don't have to worry about her being in my face for the rest of my life, and I can't even begin to imagine how that must feel. I honestly don't think I could've handled it, so he probably would've been gone under those circumstances. It just depends on you and how you feel. Ask yourself which is stronger.. Your love for him, or the resentment you feel toward him? You may not have reached the resentful stage yet, but trust me, you will. And keep in mind that men are very physical creatures (shocker), whereas as women are very emotional. For them, sex isn't always just about pleasure. It's something they often resort to in times of stress, anger, sadness, and loneliness because their brains aren't wired to express emotion like women's are. For men, sex is often used as an outlet, so it could be that he was missing you and just used her to make himself feel better (a lot of women out there are reading that last part going, ""Umm.. No."" lol), which was a really shitty thing to do in my opinion, but everyone handles things differently, I suppose. Keep in mind that I am in NO way justifying what either of our husbands did. Men might not be as emotionally complicated as women, but they know right from wrong and have the ability to control their actions just like anyone else. But if you love your husband half as much as I love mine, you won't leave him no matter how many people advise you to. So I'm just trying to help you look at it a different way to give you some peace of mind and hopefully make it a little easier on you. You'll probably always love him regardless, but your feelings for him will never be the same after this. So you just have to ask yourself if you're prepared to live with that. But you're not ""weak"" or ""stupid"" if you choose to stay. Not that anyone implied that, but that's how I spent a lot of time feeling when my husband did what he did. I'd say to myself, ""How could I possibly take him back after that? I must be crazy. Normal people don't stay with someone who cheated on them. They leave! I must be the weakest, stupidest person on the planet."" But after a while, I realized it was the complete opposite. It takes a STRONG person to stay and get past something like that cuz it hurts worse than just about anything. I'd rather have both my legs cut out from underneath me than ever feel like that again. I hope something I said made you feel a little better cuz I know what that kind of heartache feels like and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. It will get easier, I promise, but your feelings will never be the same",1
"She told him she was on birth control, and was messaging me telling me he already filed for divorce, she was taunting me, and making it a point to let me know that they was going to spend the rest of their lives together.

Not one person has even considered what he was going through at the time. It's not only the person suffering from depression and anxiety that is suffering but also the partner hence the separation. 
At the end of the day he was going through a bad time too did a stupid thing n it unfortunately resulted in a pregnancy. 
If you can't get past that n support each other through this then it won't work. 
The other lady didn't ask for all this so just try hard to make it work together n not to fight.",1
"I am bipolar. I have been on wellbutrin for years. When I first started on it, it did not come in extended release. I would have break thru anxiety attacks.   The extended release version does not seem to cause this problem and has put my depression on hold.",1
"I have bipolar disorder. The first several months were really good. But it gradually made me more and more anxious, to a point I could barely function. I think it's good for a lot of people. But it's also known to throw you into a mania and increase anxiety.",1
I am on it. I still have panic attacks bad about driving and crowds. I now can't sleep since my dose was increased but I'm no longer depressed.,1
I'm on 75 mg twice a day and 20 mg of cexela and I'm still struggling. no side affects though.,1
"Wellbutrin was the first antidepressant to work for me, so I love it. Just be careful of some of the side effects. It can cause sleep disruption, anxiety, weightloss then weight gain.",1
"I have worked up to 300 mg daily, for about a year now.
It helps stabilize my depression and anxiety.
It keeps me OFF of cigarettes.
I love it; but results may vary, blah blah blah.",1
I have depression/anxiety/PTSD and have been on it for a couple years and its worked pretty good =),1
It's helped me with the depression of my bipolar but gave me terrible headaches and did nothing for my anxiety,1
"If you're bipolar, you may want to discuss whether or not Wellbutrin is right for your condition as it can cause mania.  Since this page is also devoted to people with Depression and Anxiety as well, I can speak from experience as I don't have Bipolar, but I do have depression & anxiety.  Wellbutrin puts my depression on hold entirely.  My pervasive thought loops shut down, so I can think more clearly.  My attention is better and so is my ability to concentrate.  I've also lost about 20 pounds (but I needed to lose weight).  

Bad parts?  1.  It makes me jittery and a little twitchy.  I find myself to be more physically restless, so I move around a lot more than I used to.  2.  It wears off for me late in the evening (as I take it when I first get up in the morning) and my depression can start to rear its head again in the late evening.  I usually try to offset that by going to bed.  

Some people also say that Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety.  I can't really tell since my anxiety is so bad anyway that I doubt I'd notice if it were made a tiny bit worse.  It would have to make me MUCH worse in order for me to notice, but it can (for some people) cause increased anxiety.

If you have any side effects that are bothersome or that make you feel worse, I'm sure you already know to return to your doctor and get the medication switched.  I love Wellbutrin as it's working well for me.  I wish you only the best of luck with your new medication.",1
"It was terrible for me, caused me to be very irritable. At the time I was on it, a few years ago, I had been misdiagnosed with bipolar. I quickly took myself off of it. Years later, this year, turns out I actually have BPD/ major depression/ anxiety. 

I'm on Paxil and Xanax now and it's helped wonders. Just keep in mind, different medicines react differently with each individual.",1
It will help you quit smoking but it's terrible for anxiety or bpd.,1
"Absolutely.  Separation from a partner can become a common trigger for anxiety or panic attacks.  Your mind may ruminate over bad thoughts, they may be your main support, you may worry about them...  med adjustments and CBT can help.  Just stick with it.",1
"I have bipolar disorder, ptsd, and Add. I had horrible depression and they tried everything under the sun but just kept going down the list Zoloft worked then quit so did cymbalta so down the list we continued now I am on Paxil, abilify which is a GODSEND! Lithium, lamictal, Ativan for anxiety with Baclofen, Adderral for energy and I am finally pretty stable",1
"In general it is not used. Even in bipolar they try not to use it if they can avoid it because of the way it can beat the kidneys up. She didn't say lithium someone in the responses did, not sure if it was you or not. I'm happy it works for you. It's a battle a lot of the time finding what works for each of us I was speaking in overall general terms.",1
You can see it with me I start to shake a little and nervous also start sweating,1
"Serroquil is bad, I rather do Tylenol pm, I take hydroxyzine and it doesn't help me when i have panic attacks however i take it earlier in the morning when I knw work is going to be tuff, alprazolam is the only thing that controls my panic attacks",1
"I took Seroquel at bedtime, slept but felt like cap during the day. Exhausted and irritable to no end. Took years but finally found a combo that works well for me. Keep looking and stay on top of your doctor. You deserve to feel good, night and day.",1
"You can have them in 25mg for daytime,that's what i use,but Cannabis is way better for Anxiety,really kills it for me,life changer.Bit heavy to be on Seroquell 24/7.",1
The hydrogen is a blood pressure med i dont agree putting people on them they put me on 2 different ones one night my blood pressure was so low i just drop to the floor had to call ambulance go to emergency room. I jack my knees up so bad they hurt for 4 months. You will get more relief from the seroqul than the other i take small doses all threw the day it helps. Take anything they offer but high blood pressure meds they are messing with something they have no business doing,1
"After 25 plus years of trying this or that, Cymbalta works for me. And the best thing about it is that it takes about 3 days to start working. I am so thankful to have found this medicine, its unbelievable, for me. I am now using CBD oil hempworx. It is working wonders on my aches, pains and anxiety but my depression not so much, yet...I have faith <3. if anyone wants info on CBD oil, shoot me a message, thanks~Vonda",1
Maybe a trial of Buspar- it is specifically for anxiety but will take a couple of weeks to take effect.  Has helped me a great deal.,1
Buspar is a very light anxiety med. It sounds like you need something different. Talk to your dr.,1
"sometimes it takes lots of med changes to find the right combination stick with it, eventually you'll find a combo that works. But it does sound like you may need Ativan, klonopin valium or xanax for the anxiety itself......best of luck to you....hang in there!!",1
"Finding the right meds and dosages is a trial and error that everyone had to go through. It can be hard and this is the phase where people sometimes give up and swear off meds all together. Don't give up! You will find the right ones that work for you, please keep trying, you're on the right track.  Your doctor may need to perscribe a seperate anxiety medication. Definantly keep in contact with your doctor over the issue and keep trying things out. The only real thing I can recomend from expirence is it often takes at least 1-2 weeks on any medication to see a diffrence. Unless the side effects are dibilitating please try and give it 2 weeks before deciding things aren't working and moving on.",1
"Ah, ok. We didn't have access to music (cords can be used for asphyxiation). I missed having a support system after I got out. I had to fend for myself again - in the hospital, I just showed up to meals. I missed having people that ""got it"" - we would be genuine in our laughter, about our ""inappropriate"" jokes about where we were, having very frank discussions about what brought us there, etc. I didn't have to hide anything - everything was on the table, out in the open. Suicide attempts, mania, hearing voices, sex addiction, drug abuse. Things that were taboo in normal society were normal for us. And I still miss that. I miss being able to be myself, even if it was depressed and scared and ashamed. I never put on good graces there. I miss being safe. It took me about 3 weeks before I felt comfortable being on the outside, talking to people. And I still wasn't completely assimilated. I definitely had to put on the happy face and say that I was doing ok (even though I definitely wasn't - one week in a hospital doesn't cure you, it just gives you a safe place to start to heal). I dreaded going out to the mall (I just didn't), going grocery shopping (had to do it), running into friends (""haven't heard from you in a while!"" That's because I was in a psych ward).I physically felt like I needed to duck to avoid...something. I was off work for 6 weeks (and it would have been longer, but I teach, and it was the end of the year), and all anyone knew was that I was sick. My staff was terrific, and only 2 people knew where I was - it was the best kept secret EVER in that building. 2 people out of 120. I will never be able to re-pay that debt. But getting back into the regular world was HARD. It takes time. But it doesn't happen. For me, 3 days was just scratching the surface of my return into society.",1
"I understand it makes you feel crappy, but you shouldn't stop taking it. A lot of medication can have negative side effects but after taking them for a couple weeks and they get in your system and your body adjusted.. the side effects will go away. But now since you've stopped them, you won't know if they are going to help you or not. One of the meds I'm on actually, I had horrible side effects when I started them! I was having nightmares, I was throwing up just thinking about food and I even pissed the bed 3 nights in a row!! I told my doctor about it right away and said I can't handle this! He told me to please take them for 2 weeks.  After 1 week and 2 days those side effects started slowing down and after 3 weeks I haven't had any side effects at all! They all went away completely! I've been on this med for 4 months now and it's by far the best medication that I've ever been on in the past 20 years!!! Just my advice.. a little food for thought... ~Dani",1
Nope. I will not be ashamed of my emotions.,1
i understand how u feel i have my highs & lows while on 300mg zoloft pluse 9 mg valium and neulactil 4 a day . any emotional event can cause having lows i have trouble getting out bed as i feel when ur sleeping u feel no emotions i used to smoke a bit of canabis to help me stay calm but had heart attack cartiac arrest &   stoped  canabis so i find i struggle more without it. im in process getting my meds changed due to weight gain im dreading it cos i dont cope at all . i hope u start feeling better soon just talk to ur dr about ur medication it might need to be increased . x,1
"Having a mental illness means sometimes dosages need to be adjusted or medications need to be changed.  My exwife struggled for years until she found the right medication and dosage, first it was lithium, then topamax, finally depakote worked the best. Medications for depression and anxiety are somewhat the same, you have to get the medication that works best and the correct dosage.  For my anxiety, clonzapam was the right medication from the start, but depression medication is an on going challenge.  First it was Pristiq, then Lexapro,  Cymbalta, Amatriptyline, and countless others.  To date, I am still searching for the right medication.  Sometimes these take time, but don't give up hope.  You will get it right and you will know it.  My Exwife knew she was on the right medication without anyone telling her so.",1
"One thing that people forgot to mention is GOD. It's not about being religious but about being spiritual. And that means believing in something positive and good. There​ had to had been something that triggered those feelings of depression back. And its hard to distinguish what it was. I personally feel get those horrible feelings all of a sudden that i immediately react in a way that is unforgivable to my loved ones. I beg God to make me a different and better normal human being. Because i don't even like myself.(my outbursts). And it's been months since I've taken my meds.  And i thought that i would of already been in the mental ward by now. But thank God that he has allowed me to still be here with my family doing the best that i can to manage it. 
So what I've also done was I begged my husband to educate himself on bipolar, and all the rest of the disorder does to a person. So that he could learn how to cope and so he could help me manage it. Because all the medicine I've been taking all these years were only numbing me and I'm pretty sure not helping my liver nor kidneys.  BASICALLY WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT IN ORDER FOR ME TO COPE WITH IT ,I NEED FAITH IN GOD (NY HIGHER POWER),THE SUPPORT OF MY FAMILY (THEM LEARN ABOUT THE DISORDER) SO IT COULD SHOW THEM HOW TO Help ME Manage IT AND OF COURSE FOR THEM TO ALSO COPE .IN A POSITIVE WAY. Because if not they would had already left me and i would not know what to do with myself. I've been learning something new every day. And it doesn't matter how old or young it's always good to educate ourselves on any kind of disorder ,disease or addiction. For the sake of the ones we love. 
Positive Support from family & friends
Asking for help 
Learning technics on how to control the situations , thoughts that trigger our bipolar mood swings.  ECT... And keeping ourselves active to improve our health, helps control /manage or not think about those horrible negative feelings from getting worse and so forth. 
But eventually i believe if we follow some of the good positive advise given will do us bipolar people some time and u will see some improvement. And it does take time . And the surroundings have a lot to do with it.",1
I had horrible reactions with all the other meds. Lithium is my lifeline. I make sure to drink plenty of fluids and docs keep a close eye on toxicity and kidney and liver function. Basically trying to say different meds work differently for different people.,1
"Lithium is an old medication and I am surprised by how many people are on it. Lithium is very hard on the kidneys.
Sorry for your loss and the horrible way it went.
It's a shocker.
Epilim is also a mood stabiliser like lithium and causes zero damage to the kidneys and no side effects to me.
I strongly suggest that you give Epilim a go.
Bipolar people tend to need medication to help them manage it.
When I tried a vitimin therapy that did not work, I bounced from one disaster to the next !",1
"Hey sweetie we have all been where you are, don't just suffer. I have had bi-polar my entire life. The med. Change is an uncomfortable roller coaster, but it's worth it. You'll feel better so go to your dr and feel better soon Hugs & prayers",1
"Nope you're not the only one. I have had to do this quite often over the last 35 of having this illness. And those that say meds don't cure are right. Learning your triggers and developing coping skills is all you can do. Meds don't stop bipolar/depression and anxiety altogether. They help control it, to being able to survive/live with it.  I also remember this shall too pass. Me, personally I spend a lot of time in prayer trying to refocus myself. Also you might have to try new meds. every couple to few years I have too. The ones I may be on just stop working. It sucks, but I've always found a new med path. I hate adjusting to or trying to find new meds. Just know you're not alone and treat yourself kindly.",1
"Manic, panic, schizophrenic  ",1
I've struggled with my weight for years and I'm not even five foot .. it's so depressing. I'm fed up with being overweight . It's hard . Been difficult on my self esteem and self image,1
"Jess N Kailey , I agree with you, Jess. How can others understand a depression that is caused by a chemical imbalance if they haven't experienced it themselves? They don't. Which only adds to the stigma. And it doesn't help, either - in addition to being depressed, you should also feel guilty about it? Putting oneself out there, one will get all kind of responses -.  try to rule out the ones that only brings you down, and look for those who show actual understanding.",1
"Having a good, well respected GP is key to getting on disability. There's always a medication that can help so don't give up trying even though it can take a while to find the right combo. Marijuana is good for everything but I can't get it. For ptsd an alpha blocker like prazosin helps with nightmares. Not many gps know this. A betta blocker like propranolol is good if you have panic attacks, shakes or heart pulpitations. Other than that anti depressants and a mild antipsychotic does help with anxiety and sleep",1
"Are you open and able to try marijuana? If not, an antidepressant and mood stabilizer with something for anxiety should help! I use them all! And combined, it changed my life! And the marijuana alone, almost instantly helps bring me out of whatever I am feeling and going through! You would be surprised, my opinion though",1
"I was scared of taking meds too, but then as a last resort I did and they saved my life. Just know you are not alone in your feelings.",1
"Go on to google and try echo tapping or binaural meditation really helped my anxiety.if I have no meds I cannot function and that scares me,try and stay focuses when your zoning out concentrate on one thing in the room till it passes and do your breathing exercises. I found a new one that I like,breathe in for 4 ,hold your breath for 7 and then breath out for 8 as many cycles as you can,concentrate on counting.hope you feel calmer soon chic X x",1
"I would advise you to seek professional help. Don't be afraid of meds. They can help you live a more ""normal"" life. I've accepted that I'll be on meds the rest of my life to manage my bipolar II and the depression. Good luck to you  ",1
Sorry but l disagree l was hit with crippling anxiety very similar to you l am a strong person. I took anti depressants in combination with therapy on the NHS and two years later l am far better. Medication is sometimes the answer,1
When things get bad I write every thought down...no matter how cluttered or irrational.  Getting it all out really helps.  Sometimes I'll write more than 20 pages in my journal.  One sentence after another.  Not thinking about what I'm writing but writing what I'm thinking.  I ended up finally having the confidence of reading some to my shrink so she would understand how my head was working during issues.  After about 6 months I started being able to cope a lit better because I wasn't holding anything in anymore which made it possible to process and move forward.,1
Please see your GP as this  will not go away without the help of meds and some techniques with your anxiety. Don't suffer in silence as the help is out there. Good luck!!,1
Kava kava helped me with anxiety before I had meds. You can get it at a local health food store like Sprouts. It's where I got mine.,1
If u able to go to the gym every morning it will work wonders. ESPECIALLY if u can get into the sauna and just sweat out all the anxiety,1
I'm going through the process of trying to get disability because I suffer from bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder PTSD major depression add Panic anxiety disorder. I haven't had my hearing yet so I don't know what the outcome is going to be but my chances look good. I find that taking baths is very soothing and helps calm the mind. I also use Symphony music or some type of relaxation music when I feel an anxiety attack coming on. Breathing techniques sometimes work in through your nose and out through your mouth very slowly. Sometimes just taking a walk and changing your atmosphere will change the thoughts in your head to help you get over the anxiety. I also have a fear of leaving the house so that it's hard for me to do even if it's only to go to the corner and back try to get out of the house as much as you can. I also suffer from flashbacks and Nightmares. Melatonin is a natural sleep medication that might help you at night time. I hope you can get your insurance soon and get to a psychiatrist to prescribed some Pharmaceuticals to help you with your symptoms. Good luck to you. If you ever need to talk I will be here to listen. Talk therapy is also helpful to me.,1
"Google ""deep breathing for anxiety."" Find a method you like and practice it at least twice each day. It will help you to control the anxiety that is closely associated with the depression. I hope this helps.",1
"I know somwhat how you feel. I'm the same way too. The way I try to cope it is write in my journal, draw & color & listening to music. My depression is in my head. My anxiety is out in public.",1
"Faher van Zuiden. It is irrisponsponsible of you to say what you just did
Mainly, telling this young lady things are never permanent is beyond misleading and cruel the way you are going about it.  Psychological illnesses just don't disappear over time. Between coping skills and meds a normal happy life is possible. And saying we all have them (anxieties and depressions), yes this is true, but some of us arent the norm and catorgorizing us as such only says more that you have no idea what you're talking about when it comes down to psychological disorders. 
Now, to the person asking for help. One, you can do some research and maybe find a support group for anxiety/depression near you and talking about it does help. I have 37 years experience with this one. Also make sure you get on that phone and get an appointment somewhere as soon as your insurance starts. You might be able to get on that phone now and make the appointment.  Knowing you have an appointment coming up helps too. Are you using lavender, and eucalyptus oils. Burning them in either a diffuser or just a simple oil burner while calmly breathing while relaxing for awhile a couple times, hell as much as you can,  a day it helps too......good luck",1
Medication will reduce anxiety & depression whilst seeking professional support learning ways to manage anxiety/depression symptoms. I have qualifications in AOD & mental health so its not a half arsed comment,1
I have driving anxiety (cuhz my siblings were killed by automobile incidents) and not knowing what other drivers are going to do or how they drive really gets my nervous... However I smoke weed for my anxiety... I don't smoke enough to get high just enough to calm my nerves. And i never smoke Indica before driving.... I stopped taking pharmaceuticals years ago because they only helped if I was taking super high and unsafe doses...,1
I also suffer from panic attacks and anxiety attacks. I highly recommend you try CBD oil it did wonders for me and its all natural.,1
"I have anxiety, depression and ptsd, I can no longer drive and can barely be a passenger, it's awful.",1
"I get panic attacks while driving some times. if its a place I drive to a lot I know places I can pull over to calm myself down. try some type of distractions music,",1
"I was on all those pills plus some. I have bi polar, anxiety, depression and insomnia. My bf hated me so I quit them all at once. Now I eat vegan, and excersise. I do love my alcohol and essential oils. The pills aren't good in my opinion.",1
"I took Klonopin and Abilify for years and had NO BUSINESS driving on them. I gained 90 lbs and look back on that as a very over-medicated, dark, unnecessary period in my life. I rarely put down anyone's medical treatment as I am Not their doctor, but I am telling you my experience and this fact: It has been discovered that Adderall and Meth are chemically, essentially, the same thing. I'd be very scared to meet someone on all the meds your on AND Adderall.",1
I'd be sleeping with all that but seriously not judging. I have anxiety driving however I know how my medication affects me. So if I felt impaired at all I wouldn't risk other people's safety,1
"I gave up driving a decade or so ago because the panic attacks I was having driving were out of control.  Within a month of selling my truck the panic attacks pretty much stopped.  I went from hundreds a month to a couple a year.  It meant a major life change, but at least I'm not afraid I'm gonna kill somebody while panicking behind the wheel of a car",1
"I was AGORAPHOBIC for 5 years. Could go anywhere in a car. I would have to pull over and get out of the car due to anxiety attacks. I too have GADS , bipolar depression, and suffer from PTSD. I  currently on Prozac, Trazadone and Bupropion. It's a long story but.....  I had to get to a point , after suffering for 40 years, that I wasn't going to live my life like that anymore. No medicine helped me with my anxiety attacks. I Only became addicted to them even tho they didn't work. 13 yrs ago , I drove from Long Beach here to Moreno Valley by myself. I hadn't driven in over 10 years.",1
I was able to drive fine on klonopin. It lowered my anxiety enough so that I was able to actually function.  It's all on how you respond to the medication,1
"I'm do not like Seroquel my daughter was on it I'm on Latuda works great better than others every person is different and dose is not always easy to find I take 10mg of Diazepam for my anxiety I'm on tons of meds because I also have RA, Crohnes, diverticulitis, depression, migraine so it just keeps getting worse",1
I take gabapentin mainly for bi polar and helps bone spurs in my back thats a plus. I would change your time on kolonopin deffinatly can get you a dui if you have to go somewhere take it when you get back if it has a strong effect i take seroquel threw out the day doesnt effect anything cause my anxiety is so high,1
100mg of Seroquel left alone is enough for you to avoid driving....Damn.,1
Who can i talk to that i can discuss options with to treat my severe anxiety and  severe depression? Do I need to be referred by a primary care physician to see any specialist?,1
I take citalopram 40 mg. No problems with driving. I find it helpful if you have something to drink with you just in case a panic attack starts......it works for me anyways.,1
"I have severe anxiety while driving. I have taken severe panic attacks in the middle of big highways. I have learned when i can and cannot drive because of anxiety. I use to take lorazapam for anxiety and would take it about 30 minutes before leaving the home. It helped greatly and never felt that i was under the influence or drugged in any way. I felt like any other person driving on the road. Then i got pregnant and i decided to try to not use any meds for as long as the anxiety would let me. It has been about 2 years or so now. Anyways, i deff think there are certain meds that can help you that are okay to drive while taking them as long as you are use to them and know how it will affect you.",1
"I think it depends on your history with driving. If you got in a bad accident, you may have ptsd due to it (which case therapy would be a good remedy). If you are a new driver it is normal to feel anxious. I don't know if people have medications just for driving.",1
"I'm 30 and still have a learners permit because I'm terrified of driving. I get so anxious that I get tunnel vision, rapid heart beat, and I can't keep thoughts straight. I'm on pills for anxiety and depression, but it does nothing when it comes to cars.

I'm on Lamictal, Abilify, Hydroxyzine, Propanalol.",1
"It seems many different meds are being thrown out there to you for forthought with all their reactions/side-effects all over the place from person to person. I do know every drug works different for each of us. So I would think taking someone else's reactions to possible meds or even med combo can lead to trouble if you were see them as how you would or wouldn't react to them yourself. I wanted to believe this reality many moons ago. I have been diagnosed with this disease for 30+ years and have taken many different meds in many different combos. Remember a med can react one way with you and a whole other way with you depending on the other meds taken with it or just because your you. For instance I have taken hydroxyzine with previous meds other than the ones I'm on now and tolerated it fully. It helped, but now if I was to, well it floors me, so tired. You asked what others take for anxiety attacks. I do take klonipin 1 mg for severe anxiety. I take the dissolvable kind where they melt on my tongue and act instantly without this med I would be a basket case of anxiety. As for me, I don't linger away from docs directions for a second like taking one more or even not taking one at all, this is dangerous. Staying within my guidelines I function normal. I couldn't do gabatine and many others they just don't touch me.just know you're not alone, but that not one of us is alike with the meds that work for them. Thus, the reason these illnesses are so hard to get a hold of, yet even cure. Good luck.",1
"The way I've learned to deal with my anxiety on the road is a little unorthodox, I use a fidget spinner, it occupies just enough of my attention to ignore most of the annoyances.",1
I take buspar 2x a day every day and then I have ativan 3 per day as need at 1mg per pill I'm also on 4 other meds also since I can't go out in public with out having a panic attack,1
"I used to have full blown panic attacks any time I had to drive long distances and had to pull over and go into a gas station bathroom for 30 mins or more just to calm down.  I finally got klonopin I take once a day or twice if needed and I do okay, I 'd still rather NOT drive and be a passenger and have my tablet to keep me occupied on long trips.",1
"This sounds like me minus the klonopin. When the anxiety is bad and i try to drive like an hour away, i will panic and need to turn around and go home for a while.",1
I didn't drive for several years due to panic attacks. A wise psychiatrist put me in trofonil and it changed my life!,1
I also have driving anxiety to the point where I have to pull over and throw up. I don't take anything though. I'm on three antidepressants and that's enough.,1
"Antidepressants won't help with anxiety, unfortunately.",1
"Whenever someone tells me they got off meds and change their diet, use essential oils and exercise, first I wonder are you Bipolar because if you are, you're manic and get help. Sick people never know they're sick until it's too late. The psychosis, anxiety, suicidal ideation and general delusions I dealt with when I was truly sick and everyone saw but I thought I was fine were truly life threatening. I thought everyone else was nuts thinking something was wrong with me. Bipolar episodes are no joke. Chemical imbalances get fixed with chemicals! There's a little science for you",1
"Messing with bipolar medication is a very serious thing. Anxiety may be a symptom from the bipolar.  However no one should recommend anyone to get off medication that is not a doctor.  For some people it's a crisis without their medication because it's a legitimate chemical imbalance.  Mental illness is not anything new. GMO, gluten etc chemicals this and that wasn't around in the bible days so please keep your natural remedies to yourself unless you went to medical school.",1
"This attitude Valerie, is one that really upsets me. Don't you think those of us multiple medications to feel bad enough already",1
"Valerie Wencka I don't disagree with your opinion, but how you spoke it. 

I'm personally weaning off meds with the help of an amazing husband, change in diet, and therapy. I still have sleep meds and anxiety meds both on an as needed basis. I'm also starting college on Monday so that may change.",1
"Valerie Wencka  do you even know what it is to have anxiety? Some people's is worse than others and requires medication. Not all holistic stuff works, I have bad anxiety and take 40mg of Celexa and 2mg of Klonopin daily. The Klonopin does not make me sleepy though do not see why you can not drive.",1
"Yes, lets all stop taking our meds and instead go to Whole Foods... smh. It must be all that gluten that causes anxiety. Maybe GMOs and high fructose corn syrup too!",1
"That's the main portion of my anxiety.  I used to LOVE driving.  It was one of my favorite things to do and I insisted on being the one to drive any time my family or friends went somewhere with me.  The last year, I was suddenly afflicted with severe driving anxiety to the point that I have anxiety attacks just THINKING about driving.  My doctor put me on Klonopin and Gabapentin 3/day for anxiety, but it doesn't really help my driving anxiety.  Like you, I can't take Klonopin before driving as it makes me super sleepy.  :(  I know this probably doesn't help you much, sadly.  I don't have any real answers.  I just wanted you to know that you are not alone.  *hug*",1
If you know the anxiety  comes with driving maybe talk to your therapist they know how to deal with it when you can pinpoint a certain phobia,1
I have severe driving anxiety as well. I take only Buspirone for anxiety and so far it hasn't touched it. At least I know I'm not the only one out there with driving anxiety.,1
"I also have anxiety, ended up laying in the floor at work for 30 min + last night because of it. That was before I went home 2 hours early to take my medicine that I usually don tell need to bring with me. I only take my anxiety meds as needed, not daily. It was a really bad night. Delusional, obsessive thoughts were what caused my anxiety last night :(  I take Hydroxyzine. It says it may cause drowsiness to use care when operating a vehicle. I've never had any problems as far as being drowsy when I take it.",1
I do occasionally. When I know I'm going to be somewhere I could end up having an anxiety attack I take 2. I live in a rural area so I have to drive pretty much everywhere. Like I said I've never had any issues but everyone reacts differently.,1
"Have your primary care or GYN, do a hormone test, check your thyroid, and other possibly unrelated things that could be exacerbating your diagnosis, especially during your time of the month... that's probably a good start. Not always is it JUST a mental health issue. And if there is ANY, even the slightest increase of stress in your life, can cause significant changes... keep a journal and document it all and see if you can't pick up over the course of months, what your pattern looks like, and then take it to the doctor and let them help figure it out. And the wrong medication could be doing you worse than good. Have you tried alternative therapy and treatments? If you are bipolar, I suggest an antidepressant AND mood stabilizer and something for the anxiety attacks, and I really suggest trying marijuana for all of it. Your life will see the changes, positively, if your open to trying something different! I can't express it enough, even with it being illegal in most states, the statistics don't lie about its ability to effect the nervous system in a calming manner. My opinion though",1
This is just what happen to me i got frustrated with the pms it was so sevier would really set off depression mood swings offten i was bad they gave me a iud calm everything down. I am also bi polar anxiety adhd i take lamotragine has help i did not feel my best till they treated the adhd that can cripple your life depending on how bad left un treated,1
"I was on this medicine for years and it never got any better. I was on 600 mg twice a day on top of xanex 4 times a day and ambian at night. When my diagnosis was changed to BPD from Bipolar along with Sever Depression, PTSD, sever Anxiety Disorder & Panic Disorder. I have been on different meds for BPD. The withdrawal from lamotrigine are tough so if you do decide to change meds make sure to decrease slowly.",1
Did you ask your doctor if it's a possibility that you may have Borderline Personality Disorder with your mood swings being what they are? Because I find when I was diagnosed with bipolar and they put me on medicine for it it didn't totally work I also was diagnosed with ADD anxiety PTSD. I've now been told by my current psychiatrist that he thinks my diagnosis should be or added to of borderline personality disorder and suggest that I use DBT skills to help with my mood stabilization. Maybe this type of therapy can help you too,1
"DBT is dialectical behavioral therapy it helps people that have a hard time regulating their moods and emotions often have feelings of abandonment, Suicidal Thoughts or ideas, long-term depression, anxiety Karma PTSD, feeling like your life is just existing. it's a certain set of skills that you learn several different ones to help change these thoughts to more positive ways. I'm sure if you Google borderline personality disorder or DBT it can explain it better than I can",1
"Are you girls seeing gynocologist you may have hormonal disorders, I had same problems,. Was diagnosed with polysistic disorder. Although I'm also BP1 with panic anxiety kinda sounds like it coincides!",1
Nikki Shamell     ,1
"Even though I have had professionals tell me I am a very strong person I still consider myself weak. When I'm smiling I'm usually pretending because I don't want to make others uncomfortable. I have missed too many events in my families lives to count. because I couldn't put that pretend smile on My biggest regret was not being in my nephew's lives.. I do cry in private at times, but for the most part the tears won't come and I internalize my hurt. I fight many battles that I keep to myself.",1
"   I didn't get a licences until I was 21, I'm almost 32 and  can only drive in town limits on side roads without panic attacks.  So I have ""routes"" I take to get where I need to go at certain times when I know traffic is minimal.  Aka,  agoraphobia.   BTW population here is around 6,000, town is literally like 5mines long max.  I have only driven on the highway twice since I started driving to test the amounts of anxiety and panic I get from the fast motion movement. Also,  not medicated besides as needed clonopin because my body reverses medication like magic.  Passenger  is twice as bad for me I usually always end up with a panic attack",1
"They have changed my life,initially I thought they made me feel flat but then realised they had stopped all th background anxiety and my brain was quiet,they also stabilised my mood swings x",1
"Im on setraline, it takes a while to kick in but its the best thing I ever did, i have bipolar disorder type two and anxiety disorder, setraline is the best thing! Whatever you do, dont stop it, even on days when you feel good.. I take mine at night, it helps alot x",1
"Am on 100mg, due to depression (which is pretty much under control now) and severe social anxiety. For me, it dampens the anxiety down far enough that I can function. I still get anxious, especially out in crowds, but it doesn't affect me as much as it used to before I went on medication.",1
"Its also an antidepressant, I was on it for almost 2years for depression, anxiety and ocd. I thought it was great until I forgot to take it. If I missed a day I was all over the place, and would be mentally screwed for the day, I was even at the point where I selfharmed, which is definitely not me.  Everyone is different tho.",1
"Personally for low mood and anxiety, I'd want to be on fluoxetine (Prozac)...",1
"I am in no way an expert but I think maybe you should have your Dr put you on some  newer drugs to try. I am bipolar 1, ptsd, social anxiety disorder,and chronic depression. I take wellbutrin in the morning, plus a cans.  Afternoon I have cans. At  bedtime I take two xanax and  Venlfaxine. It works for me. It manages all of my illnesses",1
"Why would they put you on gabapentin for stress and depression?? It's a painkiller as far as I know and a strong one! It can have serious mood effects for some people, one person I know ended up not being able to take it because he got really angry and lashed out on it... The electric shocks you are having are a side effect of one of the pills you are taking and means that one of them isn't agreeing with you - you need to get off it and/or try something different. This symptom is not normal nor should you tolerate it you could end up sicker. I usually only got electric shocks when coming off them as a withdrawal symptom but I know others who got it while taking them and they had to change meds asap",1
I think it's just extreme anxiety and depression. I don't think anything else is acting up,1
"Slow down a little.  Breathe, don't panic.  Understand that your fights effect your mental status.  Talk, yell, cry to your therapist.   Don't jump back in to the frying pan.  At least for awhile.  Are you on meds??  With bipolar and anxiety disorders, sounds like you are.  If not, you might want to consider it, with your Dr.  Now, some meds can make you feel numb.  Did for me, anyway.  I, too, have bipolar and anxiety disorders, along with others.  Been on many, many different med combos, and have had the numbness.  Talk with your Dr/therapist.   Let them guide you.  Have also been in abusive relationships,  whether it be physical,  emotional or being abused mentally.  They all mess with your disorders.  Clear your head before making any major decision in regards to hooking back up with him.  Is it worth it??  You need to take care of YOU!!  Talk to yourself...ask yourself questions.  Answer yourself.  Yes, there will always be good times, comforting times, but keep in mind, the rocky times, and, again ask yourself if it's worth all that.  How much can you take??  But, like I suggested, talk with your Dr and therapist.  It helps to get as much input as you can, so you can choose what works for you!!  I finally came to the point of saving myself from breakdown.  And that was after a plan of suicide.  Good luck to you!!  I hope you get alot of feedback here also.  You're in my prayers!!  GOD BLESS!!",1
"I too have bi polar, mixed bi polar and anxiety. I often feel numb and doubt if I should be in a relationship. I would love to be able to give you some advice, but if you are anything like me, when some one tries to help me it becomes all scrambled up in my head because of the anxiety. All I can say is don't make a decision because you feel guilty for another person. You have to do what you feel. If you make the decision out of feeling guilt for the other person then it will make things worse for you and the other person. But it always has to be what YOU want ok. Don't take this to heart ok, it's just my way of thinking. Good luck. X",1
"Do not make a decision until you feel stabilized. I would also discuss this with a supportive individual, therapist or doc. All mine tell me that my partner is creating an atmosphere that makes my disease worse in a cyclic manner so I may feel better for a bit, and then crash again, repeat. (abusive) He controls EVERYTHING and it is scary! I have not been stable for a long time - years.",1
"I have bipolar 1 and anxiety.  I've been married 31 years and can tell you nothing is easy.  I tell my wife that I love her the best way I know how, but sometimes I just suck at loving.  I think the part about feeling nothing for someone is more a part of the disorder than real emotions.  When I get to feeling apathetic in my heart I use my brain, my logic to reason with my self that I care deeply for those I love.  I'm 51 years old and I think fighting lessens with age.  I also don't believe there is one perfect person we're supposed to be with.  The question to ask is ""is he a decent guy?...if I had a grown daughter would I want her to be with a guy like this?""  If so, then probably a guy worth fighting for.  Remember that you are a person worthy of love regardless of some diagnosis some doctor gave you.  Be the best version of you...okay I think that last part I saw on that show the office, but you get the gist.  Best of luck.",1
"I Remember feeling numb in the past, it's horrible being told by your doctor that you have no feelings, I'm also going through a medication change all I want to do is Sleep and drown the voices out with music on my mp3 player. Don't worry I know my medication is causing this. Like amber murder aguero says try to talk to him, explaining how you feel. It's not unusual to feel numb, do you blame him for any of your troubles if so it's love. You go against the people you love the most.",1
I have bipolar depression- anxiety schizophrenic and PTSD so I am struggling beyond measure to not be an emotional wreck,1
"I been on mixed if meds for depression,anxiety,bi-polar and after years of trial and errors finally founds one that work without a lot side effects but depends on the person for what works for them.",1
"Yes i am trying that too i started this year went off my meds find out the meds were making me worse decicded to try other things, i take a vit for your brain helps with stress, memory, mood, and vit D3 and others also do essential oils there are recipes for all driffrent mental disorders and i found 3 for bipolar were you mix oils together and put them on your back of neck and forhead and wrist, seem to help me",1
Be careful with St John's Wort. One side effect is agitation/anxiety. I learned that the hard way.,1
"Sam-E, decent mood stabilizer, valerian root can help some when taken at onset of anxiety, it's also decent for headaches and muscle cramps/spasms, it is a sedative and muscle relaxant so please keep this in mind when taking it.",1
"No problem! I take a Mg supplement with my meds just fine -it's an element that the body naturally needs, and it helps muscle tension and constipation (by loosening the digestive tract - one common product is Milk of Magnesia, used to treat constipation. It is in the hydroxide form. It also draws water from the intestines, which helps soften feces and make them easier to pass). I also do a Mg regime after a hard conditioning workout for hockey, or after a long training run. It helps alleviate some of the soreness the next day. Epsom salt baths are particularly good for this purpose (I actually use it in an ice bath to cut down the inflammation, same as you would with a cold pack, but for my entire body, instead of a localized area). The US RDA on it is 400-420 mg per day for men, about 300 for women. It comes in several different forms, among them glycinate, citrate, and oxide. I I know there is a minor contraindication with Xanax and magnesium oxide, but it is very rare, considered to be clinically irrelevant. Some forms will mess with the gut more than others - I can't take citrate, but glycinate is good for me. It is in my vitamin regimen, with the blessing of my doctor, even though I take an insanely high dosage, and my body tolerates it well. (More than you ever needed to know about Mg, I'm sure! But it's one of my staples, for several issues). Also, you can't really overdose on it - whatever the body can't use, it will excrete",1
"I had a similar reaction to all the med's I was given I came off all med's about a year ago,it was really hard as it made me really ill even with doctors supervision. Since then I have CBT cognitive behavioural therapy, I make fruit smoothies with as many antioxidants Frits as I can I also add protein powder. On top of that I walk 2/3 hours a day eat small amounts of red meat lots of veggies. i have regular blood tests to make sure my body has enough vitamin D,C and ion ext. I have never felt so good. I know it's still early days but I find the more natural I keep my diet it really helps my moods. The walking is very important other exercises would also help but I find the exercise in the outdoors is best for me. I stopped drinking alcohol as this effect my moods and anxiety a lot. I'm also trying to learn meditation to do before bed then put on relaxing music to fall to sleep with no voice just relaxing sounds this together with the above has been more successful for me than any mesd's . It is just as important to do this daily as you would take your med's . I have bipolar 2, and suffer with anxiety. I hope this information is useful. Please never come off any medication with at consulting you doctor. Some doctors think only mesds will work but I disagree for me. I also have the ability to use my bipolar mind which is my favourite part to achieve amazing things. Med's block that part. ❤️",1
I diffuse essential oils to help me sleep and deal with my anxiety and depressive phases along with my meds...i haven't had to increase any meds for 3 yrs now.,1
"I use cannibis for my bad days. I dont smoke it I eat it. Cook it into stuff that I can munch on with out going nuts. It helps so much. Especially since I dont use it to get high. Just to help sleep or take care of the bad days. I have depression, anxiety, and bipolar.",1
I have heard where there is medical marijuana they do prescribe it for mental problems. I smoke for years self medicating for my adhd and anxiety i couldnt work with out it. But being against the law tried to quit for years finally did. Now on disablity i suck at the jobs i do. I have a small one now i think will work. But something to be said for the thc,1
I have been able to cut my meds in half with medical marijuana. Saved my life. I take my diazepam just a few times a month if I get night terrors. I still need Rx meds. Seroquel at night to sleep and as a mood stabilizer. Two birds ...,1
"I haven't tried many things, but I know that lavender helps with anxiety and stress.",1
I haven't but if you are still on prescription medication please consult your dr before starting natural remedies. I know for one St. John's wart is used to treat mild depression and anxiety but it can cause serious side effects when mixed with antidepressants.,1
"Seek out a good holistic dr. They will guide you. Please don't be scared off by all this interactions. Not to mention, there are better things than St. John's Wart. St. John's wart is heavily advertised, but its not the only nor best natural anti-depressant.",1
"Here is what I assume to be fairly exhaustive list of interactions:

"If I don't express my feelings,  get them out. I explode! I have never wallowed!  I have, shoved away and pretended that it's all ok. That's not learning anything... So your statement is kinda hurtful, and condescending. (I suffer from bipolar, severe depression, social anexity, fear of abandonment, and lots more) Js",1
Me too I used too too do that I'm on trazadone 200 milograms and I sleep through the night was taking three different things since I'm allergic to benadryl I can't take that but I've been sleeping so not worried I also take abilify and other meds been on medicine since I was four the youngest case of bipolar they'd seen at Scott and white,1
I take seroquel and Ambien and I still struggle to sleep but it did get better when I got prescribed ambien,1
"EMDR is incredible!!! I cannot praise it enough! I was offered it for PTSD several years ago and I'll admit, I was skeptical. However, it worked and things that I couldn't ever stand thinking about I can now talk about without feeling upset all over again. The science behind how it works is fascinating! Good luck! xx",1
"Caused sedation, nausea, restless legs, tremors, and grogginess all day long even taking it the night before... I felt like a slave to it.  So glad I'm off it now.",1
"Made me incredibly tired, severe weight gain, night terrors and terrible nightmares. Caused an incredible sugar craving as well.  I went up to 800mg a day but eventually stopped it.",1
"I had to increase higher every month because I absorb and get used to things fast. I felt more anxious at night which didn't help, but it makes me fall asleep every night, which is amazing for me!! Didn't help with anything else though that I wanted it to though. But everyone is obviously different!!!",1
I'm currently on it to help me sleep and use 25mgs just when needed. I used it earlier in the year also for anxiety. I love it! It helped reduce the anxiety/panic to a manageable level and it helped me sleep deeply at night without that awful drugged hangover feeling you get from sleeping pills and apparently it isn't addictive... although as I'm trying to cut down the usage I have to wonder if it is addictive. Or maybe I'm just addicted to a decent nights sleep lol?,1
"I love how Seroquel has helped me. I am able to sleep without paranioa and hearing voices. I even wake up well rested, refreshed, and in a good mental head space. The only thing is it makes me a horrible midnight snacker ... Therefore I gained a lot of weight, now I'm not as heavy ... All I did to curve the weight gain was I took all my favorite snack foods and replaced them with healthier alternatives and plus I walk to exercise. I take 300mg at night before bedtime. The only other nuisance is that some days it takes about 1-2 hours to take effect, but most of the time it knocks me out in 45 minutes.   ",1
"Lots of side effects at 300 mg a day.
But saved
My
Life. Helps with paranoia and suicide thoughts",1
I bet it will help u. Gosh it sure did me. You'll over come the side effects enough to realize the benefit ( being alive ). I take other stuff too but the paranoia and self harm help is totally credited to seriquil I'm not to proud to admit it saved my life. Big hug 2 u for what your dealing with. I have been there,1
Horrible nightmares that were so real I would wake up super anxious and tearful.,1
"Trouble swallowing, restless legs, weight gain, tremors. It worked great for my mood and sleep but the side effects were too much for me to handle",1
Meds are individual. I ha shakes really bad phycotic visions....,1
"I have been on Seroquel for about 4 years- it definitely causes a lot of sedation- have no idea how people take it during the day and  weight gain is a likely side effect as well.  I was up to 350 and then decreased to 200 and it was the most uncomfortable process I have ever been through.  Severe body aches, sweating nausea and an out of control mood so just take the minimum that will control your symptoms as getting the dose down will be hard.",1
I'm on 200mg at first I got restless leg really bad on the lower dose and now at 200 they are gone. I do get the munchies after I take it and I've gained weight on it but overall it seems to work for me,1
You'll get fat.  And tired.  Restless leg syndrome.,1
I took it for a while 300mg. I would take it and within 15 mins I was knocked out asleep. I would take it at sleepovers and my friends would make fun of me bc I'd start babbling incorrectly and pass out. I'd sleep with NO MINIMUM of 9 hours. And getting off of it was a bitch. Withdrawal and irritability we're making my life hell then. But as a medication for mood stability it worked very well. Probably one of the best I've taken. Faitige is the main down fall.,1
"Made my anxiety worse/Made me restless, couldn't wake up from deep sleep, would eat everything in my path",1
It gave me restless legs..and I was ALWAYS sleeping,1
I struggle with this daily...,1
Scariest place ever,1
My dearest sister. I am soooooosorry that I embarrassed you. It was not meant to be that way. I will always love you. As I recall we spoke on the telephone just a few days ago. You offered no help at all. I know you can not be hear and I know you can't afford a lot. I just wished for hope. Doris does nothing. So it's all stuck on me. I do not appreciate that. I have filled for section 8. Then I won't have nothing to do with dad.,1
"Sometimes  medication isn't always the answers i used to struggle to sleep most nights , brain over thinking to many things , or id fall asleep and then have a disturbed sleep maybe wake up to 6 times , I always try go bet at the same time as it gets me into a routine (like you would as a child) then I listen to music on YouTube , music for anxiety , music for insomnia , Theres so many , and some of them play for the whole 8 hours and I find there the ones that help me stay asleep , if they are just quick ones that send you off and only last 40 mins I'm up again within two hours , your ears are the only thing that don't sleep , I found this really helped me along side taking my mood stabilisers and anxiety tablets",1
"So simple and so cheap...Celestial Seasoning Sleepy Time Tea. I'm not exaggerating, it works as well as any sleeping pill I've taken without any side effects. I was most recently on Restoril and it worked but it was literally making me sick so I decided to stop taking it. I was terrified of not being able to sleep and my psychiatrist asked me to just give the tea a try with my regular night time meds. It knocked me out. All night. I woke the next morning completely shocked that I had slept...with no nightmares. I couldn't remember anything, just deep warm relaxed sleep and I had no morning migraine or nausea like every other day on Restoril. It's amazing but I guarantee you 99.9% docs are not going to suggest it. Cost $3.98 for a box of 20. Worth twenty times that!  Good luck  ",1
what a horrible message to reinforce to someone who struggles so.. they have enough issues with self defeat.... they need to see messages of their worth....,1
My boyfriend had stuck around. I live in fear of him leaving me...everyone leaves as I have nothing positive to offer anyone.,1
No worries   ,1
"actually, i prefer to be know as a manic depressive...Bipolar is often confused with schizophrenia..",1
"Yeah, they take a psychotropic concoction called ayahuasca..a mixture of DMT and monoamine oxidiser inhibitors..they also use it for chronic drug addiction. Don't think it would go well with Lithium though  ",1

I do recommend Epilim over lithium.
For high or low blood pressure Hawthorne tablets work.",1
Blood Pressure off the charts tho,1
"I think first of all you must have a happy life before deside to try a quit medications i been trying sometimes and i am trying right now but i am very calm and ""happy"" that helps but i notice i get upset more easy than with medication , good luck..",1
"You shouldn't have to feel nervous- it's our bodies. I was on lamictal and Wellbutrin (and a few others!) and just one week dropped my dose then the next week dropped it again then I was off. And I did great! I've traded all my meds for clean eating, exercise, and essential oils. It's something I have to plan and work on DAILY, but it's natural abd my body feels great. No more side effects from all those meds! ❤️ 
Good luck and listen to your own body!",1
"Well, what works well for one person may not for another.  Tell your Dr that these particular meds make you feel nervous,  maybe even edgy.   Some meds that I've been on in the past made me feel like I was going to crawl out of my skin!  So tell you Dr.  They will then start lowering your dosage and try a different med.  Plenty of meds out there, so it may take time to find the right combo.  If you plan to stop taking them on your own, before you can get in to see your Dr, taperr off them very slowly.  Very slowly.  Cut back a pill at a time, but do it every couple 2 weeks, if not 3 weeks.  Yes, it is a slow process, but don't stop abruptly!!!  The risks are far to dangerous!!  I've had to taper off many meds that made me feel uncomfortable,  so I speak with many years experience.   If you can see  your Dr asap, that's the best way to go.  Don't be discouraged that these 2 meds aren't working for you.  Like I said, there's many, many more to try.  Hopefully you find this helpful.  You're in my prayers!!",1
Do  you want to be mentally stable or do you want to worry about your size? There's still ways to maintain a healthy weight wether you're on meds or not...,1
"Obsessed with philosophy...to the point where like in the matrix, took the red pill, no going back. The ""human world"" as opposed to the natural world, seems so strange to me",1
"Doesn't sound like its you in this situation. If he has a girlfriend but is not s cheater he probably shouldn't be hanging around you if he's got feelings. Anyhow, when I'm in an episode I talk super fast but then start to stutter. I get very irritated by that. But that makes it worse. I end up doing s mental breathing moment. And it gets a little better. You could say to your friend that not everyone has the same life experiences. Just breathe a little.",1
I hear you. I prefer to have more meaningful conversations with people and that makes it difficult and awkward to talk to people who don't want to think a bit deeper.,1
"He's not a friend.
Sadly, the world is filled with these people, they are manipulative and self-centered, and with time you will learn to avoid them, because you will understand that you are much better than this, you're on higher grounds and they don't like that, they want to drag you down, and you don't need toxic people in your life even if that means having to be on your own.

I can tell you briefly about my personal experience with these people, read on if that interests you: 
I had best friends, they were 4, we used to hang out together all the time for 7+ years, we were like brothers, then came that night when they were all hanging out at one of them as usual, so i went up to see them and they started attacking me, one said i'm a bitch, one said i'm a hypocrite and a liar, one said i'm insignificant, and the last one just told me that since his ""brothers"" think of me that way, then he wants no connection with me. I tried to explain things, but they weren't listening, it was like talking to walls, so I hurriedly rushed out of the apartment, drove my car fast away from them, I was crying, I felt miserable, when I arrived home, I noticed a text from one of them saying: ""are you on drugs?"", it was the most hurtful text i have ever received, I will never forget this text, instead of saying something nice, they still wanted to hurt me some more. I never replied and I never saw them again. It was a shock for me not having friends, especially that I lost touch with everyone else during these 7 years, I tried to make connections, it never worked, I still feel the emptiness of being alone 10 years later, but i'm growing tougher now, I'm learning that I don't need people to feel good, that I can do my own thing by myself, I still miss having friends around though, but then i remember that story and i think to myself, perhaps i'm better off this way.",1
I'm sorry your feeling hurt.  Sometimes my husband acts similarly and I get so anxious.  Since he at this point is just a friend I would let this relationship go.  You deserve so much better.  There are people that understand mental illness and are kind.  I will keep you in my prayers.,1
Is it really necessary to be rude to someone obviously struggling? Does that make you feel better  about yourself?,1
Bless your heart I'm scared all the time   You can make it through this.,1
"Ive been where you are. Feeling like there is no other option but death is sad and scary :(. Ive been hospitalized quite a few times for suicidal thoughts and attempts. 

This can be a lonely and scary time. Please know that all of us care and hope you can get to a healthier emotional place soon!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️",1
I live in the United States I wish I knew more about your area to help you. I'm also suicidal at times but I know that my life is worth it and that there's people in my life that love me and they would really be saddened if I wasn't here anymore and that's what I have to keep telling myself. Don't be afraid to go to a mental hospital they will help you and get you the right treatment that you need and reinforce those good things that you have about yourself and hopefully change your thinking were you can feel good about yourself from the inside and don't need other people to validate that for you. I will be thinking about you and putting you in my prayers feel free to text me anytime if you need to talk,1
"Be strong ,it's your life,do it for you,don't scared they will help you,just sleep eat and chill in the unit,the nurses are amazing people",1
"One of my friends calls the physc ward the ""crayon box"" probably cause you get to color in some of them. Sometimes it can be peaceful there. Like a mini vacation. People take care of you and you dont have to worry about your problems.",1
"Heyya..my father was in the same situation a couple of months ago. He felt anxiety, breathlessness.. wanted to end his life but I would recommend you to visit a good psychiatrist and get proper meds .. meds help a lot due to which he recovered.. nothing was working for him but the meds helped him in the end. And please do not take such a step! Life is worth fighting for..we are with you!",1
Sending you lots of love and positive energy. Everyday is a struggle for me. I'm glad someone was looking over you and hope you find the care you're needing right now ❤,1
"You are doing the right thing and you will be alright. Don't be scared, it's not as bad as you would think. I'm sending many Blessings to you.",1
"Read this...we are all broken, but our brokenness serves a purpose 

My pastor shared this little story today...it's good.

                 The Cracked Pot

A Water Bearer in India had two large pots, each hung on each end of a pole which he carried across his neck. One of the pots had a crack in it, and while the other pot was perfect and always delivered a full portion of water at the end of the long walk from the stream to the master's house, the cracked pot arrived only half full. For a full two years this went on daily, with the bearer delivering only one and one half pots of water in his master's house.

The perfect pot was proud of its accomplishments, perfect to the end for which it was made. But the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection, and miserable that it was able to accomplish only half of what it had been made to do. After two years of what it perceived to be a bitter failure, it spoke to the Water Bearer one day by the stream. ""I am ashamed of myself, and I want to apologize to you."" ""Why?"" asked the bearer. ""What are you ashamed of?"" ""I have been able, for these past two years, to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your master's house. Because of my flaws, you have to do all of this work, and you don't get full value from your efforts,"" the pot said.

The Water Bearer felt sorry for the old cracked pot, and in his compassion he said, ""As we return to the master's house, I want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path."" Indeed, as they went up the hill, the old cracked pot took notice of the sun warming the beautiful wild flowers on the side of the path, and this cheered it some. But at the end of the trail, it still felt bad because it had leaked out half its load, and so again it apologize to the bearer for its failure. The bearer said to the pot, ""Did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of your path, but not on the other pot's side? That's because I have always known about your flaw, and I took advantage of it. I planted flower seeds on your side of the path, and every day while we walk back from the stream, you've watered them. For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my master's table. Without you being just the way you are, he would not have this beauty to grace his house.""",1
Its not scary. At all. Itll give you some help,1
Im sorry. An its not that scary there. They'll take good care of you.,1
Positive energy coming your way and a great big hug.  I've been there.  I was hospitalized in June and it was scary but the people were incredibly nice and so helpful.  I wish you all those things.  Hang in there.  Just take one moment at a time and breathe.  <3,1

"Some people are afraid to ask for help. As they worry about what people think, there Fitbit makes them feel worse, the best thing for depression or any thing else it's best to talk about it, if not! It makes things worse, there is help out there! Just go for it and enjoy the ride , x",1

I hope and pray you get the needed help so you may feel whole again. I have a friend's son that is currently reaching out that is feeling hopeless! I took him in to my home long enough to where he did seek help and is now feeling better! Nothing to be ashamed of we have all been to the bottom of the pit at times. You are going forward with what you need to do for yourself be proud of that. Never make permanent decision on a temporary thought. Someone out there needs you ty for aharing,1
Sending lots of love to you. Do not fear being admitted. I have been there many times but I did eventually get through it. All the very best to you.,1
"First: You are getting help, pat yourself on the back for this or give yourself a hug - well done, that is the first step on a scary road! Secondly: all Mental Health Units feel scary as they can have noisy (and nosy) people there. What you have to remember is that these people DON'T JUDGE. You need help and that is what they are there for. Tell the truth. Try to explain how you feel. Others are there for the same reason as you. It takes some time but there is light at the end of that horrible dark miserable tunnel! It doesn't seem like it yet but the light IS there! You just need a hand to help you find the light switch. I have been where you are. It is terrible and my heart goes out to you, truly. Strange as it may seem you will meet some great people in the unit who are similar to you but who have been there a few times where this is your first time. Take some deep breaths, try not to judge yourself too harshly and take each day as it comes. We are all here for you.❤️❤️❤️",1
"How very good people can be. So heart-warming, Lisa, in this sometimes terrifying world. Much love to you, brave heart that you are.x",1
Be glad you are alert and oriented in because that's really really even more scary when you are hallucinating and do not know what is real and what it's not because I've had a psychotic episode with this it just got so severe with my PTSD but I'm really really glad that you're getting help honey please take the help it's really going to be okay,1
You are worth living I am so happy that you're at the psych ward that you definitely need to be there honey just to get things in perspective but you can do this we just have to find the right counselor to help you get through it and please don't hesitate to post in this group I'm really happy you that you're there and you made it and you're going to get through this,1

I've been in and out of hospital the last 11 years. Nothing to be scared of man.,1
Thank you! It is so hard to apply this to myself but it's easy to be there for others if that makes sense ... I don't want to make this post about me but I will say  Hilary Fredman every day is a struggle to just get out if bed,1
I was in for a month last year for two attempts.  It was so scary to me but now I am stable and feel really good.  Hang in there and I will pray for you.,1
I'm so sorry to hear this. You will be ok. There are people who care. Believe me. I signed myself into one years ago. And I am the better for it. Don't be afraid. You reached out. That's the first step to recovery. God bless you. And I will pray for you.  If you ever need a friend  I'm here.    ,1
This resonated with me.  You really helped me just now.  I'm close to the edge and I'm seriously scaring myself,1
praying for you hosp should help tremendously go to groups n stay involved for best results everyone is there w their skeletons to so no shame in it,1
"I was in one about two months ago, it's not as scary as you would think there are usually some very nice ppl in there, and the staff won't let you come to any harm. Just try you're best and tell them what's going on in your life and they will help you they are there to help you    it's not a nice place but I definitely needed to be in there at the time as I wasn't safe because I tried to kill myself four times in a short time, there is help afterwards too so pls just take the help x",1
"I know it's scary, been there myself, but remember that everyone there is going thru their own HELL and can relate. No one judges there. You'll get understanding and respect. Believe in yourself! My prayers are with you honey!!",1
"I cried when i left.  Ill never forget all the others that went through that chapter of my life with me. (Yes, those 5 days felt like a whole chapter) i learned so much out about me and ever those around me!  While in there make the best of it. You are in there and you set the tone.  Either be miserable or get the most out it!",1
"Man don't I know that feeling too well. Been there twice. Sending positive vibes sweetie. The staff are very supportive if you're feeling any sorts of anxiety bout the whole scenario. 

I had a meltdown on two nurses & they managed to calm me down.",1

Just ask your GP they do understand it's not good to stop all at once because of side affects don't be afraid to ask the question but be prepared for the response sometimes we feel we can do without medication I've tried numerous times only to end up back on them,1
Just say youd like to try and see how you could get on without tablets. And could they help you wean off them. Im sure you already know you cant just stop tablets. And least lowering it slowly is an aim and a goal. I have BPD and its rather different to BP but its the similar principle. Also im in the UK so im unsure how the medical practising works over there. If you feel you dont need them just talk to them. If you're nervous take someone with you. Or write a note and give them it so they can understand. Good luck x,1
"users and obnoxious men are the ones putting themselves out there cus they know what they want... if an insecure woman doesn't feel wanted... she won't notice you when you do. don't be obnoxious, but speak up and be honest...

"It really depends. Often my own experiences etc are what make me awesome at my job cause people can tell that i genuinely empathize and my knowledge/experience allows to better help others. But sometimes, I find the stress/work hours/sometimes even the environments etc of nursing negatively impact my own mental health. I love what i do, know i am good at it, but in all honestly there have been times ive considered changing careers. And there's times i do struggle a bit. Really its something you have to decide on your own :) best wishes.",1
"I was a qualified nurse for 35 years with depression,anxiety and bpd but I have had to give it up as my shitty memory and dread od something going wrong did not make me a safe practioner. It is knowing when to stop, my mental health problems gave me more empathy with all my patients X x",1
"I'm a nurse and have bipolar depression. I believe this makes me a better nurse. People see a mental illness as something terrifying. It's not.

Be a great nurse and make a difference.",1

"ER.  If she won't go, call a doctor to find out how you get an emergency psych hold.  You may need to see if she has a medical power of attorney.  She could be in a depressive psychosis, which is no joke.  Better safe than sorry.  Don't worry about pissing her off.  Better she be alive and pissed, than dead.",1
"All I want is to be held tight. Lots of Love and affection and to be reassured that the one person I need the most is there even if i try and push away I need them to pull me closer. It's fucked up when I act like i don't need them or want them when I really do - more then ever! Worst thing to do is to leave them alone or go in a mood coz they're being ""ignorant or awkward by ignoring you"" sometimes we want to talk and communicate but just can't as the words won't come out. It's horrible especially when asked ""what's wrong""  and we really don't know..
In my experience if someone trys to shut u out and push u away then pull them in closer tight affectionate hugs and kisses and just talk to them about anything and everything they may not respond for a while but they are listening and it's taking their mind away from how they are feeling and pulling then back into the real word.",1
Mine is. Yes. Newly adjusted. And they say it takes weeks to adjust. The anxiety has increased since it was.,1
"You first need to work out weather you can handle this as this is not going to a one off. If you can just be there, lye with her, hold her hand , sit with her just offer he a few reassuring words. Make her comfortable.  Does she have a care plan of what she like when she poorly. If not when she well  make one so you have insight which help her. It can be very distressing to watch and it normal to feel useless.There not much that can be done apart from be understanding and make them comfortable and safe.
.Also look after yourself there is carers support out there too. All the best.  All the best",1
"Do NOT do that!! Unless she has taken something it will make it worst, make the person feel shameful or just piss them off. 
 Lots of love and heavy blankets!",1
I tend to do this on my partner. Best thing we do is put on something I love on Netflix & snuggle up. Being there greatly comforts. The pain gets overwhelming. It's never personal.,1
Make a fruit smoothy put honey and protein powder in it . I wouldn't put her meds by the bed but take them to her with a large glass of water. Give the house a good clean as I feel so guilty when I come round and I see all the things I've let go in my home. You could always get some relaxing music just sound no voices meditation music. You should maybe go and see her docter or therapist for advice you need someone to it will help you feel stronger . Depending on how bad you think this is only you will know as you know her best  she might need some outside support. Your amazing she's very lucky to have you and I'm sure you feel the same about her. When she comes round tell her how proud you are of her and how much you love her shell probably feel really guilty and it's a very fragile time. Fresh air and a walk in the peaceful country side is good when she's up to it. x,1
"And for god sake, dont tell her shes faking it like my otherhalf just did when having a panic attack",1
"I do this. I know what would make me happy when I'm like this. Surround her with soft cosy stuff. Quilts blankets. Make her a safe nest. You don't need words. If she's happy for you to stroke her hair do it. If not don't take it personally. Above all else right now she needs to feel secure. Quietly checking on her. No loud noises. Don't try and move her from where she is even if she looks uncomfortable. Just create a nest around her. 
This too shall pass. She will return. Sending love xx",1
I do that honestly. Give her time to calm down. Sometimes it will be one or two days for me. I don't want to talk or anything. I get in an argument or stress or something and it makes me just shut down,1
"Just lie down beside her,hold her and tell her you understand. When I shut down like this,its because the pain is overwhelming and I can't think,move or talk. I wish my husband would understand but he just yells at me and calls me lazy. Thats the worst thing to do.",1
"Honey thats absolutely horrible.

I hope you find someone who deserves you real soon.

You are a good person even if some people dont want to see it.",1
"This person wasnt saying to give up!!! This person was struggling themselves and had been given up on and was simply reaching out i believe.  Not in any way saying to give up on her but rather that in his experiences, people have just given up. He was saying to please stick it out and just give her space.( just my opinion on it)",1
Im looking for advice hear . I suffer from depressiin and anxiety but ive been asked if i have bipolar twice during debates. I have searched symptoms and cant really decide myself . Can anyone give me advice please xxx,1
My fear is that I will no longer be the person I once was...,1
I will always just survive day to day. Being around others and doing pretty much anything is sometimes an overwhelming effort. I have to work a very simple job as I have avoid all stress as it's a serious trigger. I don't drive or have any skills due to all my effort being taken up with battling depression and anxiety for the past 20 years. I take no pleasure in life and most if the time just want everything to end.,1
I have ANXIETY to cope with. But I try every day to cope and do my best. It's hard but I'm a survivor.,1
Manic for me is just restless and agitated..no grandiosity certainly doesn't feel good. Anyone else feel the same?,1

Thank goodness it was a human services agency, and they understood that shit. But I was out of work for a month and in a psych ward for a week. It is only within the last 6 months I have my diagnosis. I don't know if I will ever find the real me again. Sorry to go off in a different direction but you aren't alone. I had to give up records too. Hugs and good luck.",1

I'm sure it does have some effect cuz I have never felt so panicky about where my life was going. I mean before I've been suicidal and I always thought it was going to be over soon but I felt ok with that and my thoughts and actions made me cry, but it isn't the same as that panic I've been feeling.",1

The one thing that has been helping me a lot lately is reminding myself that my true sickness is my anxiety disorder. Everything else is just false and my irrational thinking comes from my anxiety. And if I am sick, it's normal people get sick all the time it doesn't mean you're going to die.",1
"All who are suffering, I have been there also, be assured that this also comes and goes, you fill as though you're suffocating, when panic sets in I find talking to a friend or anyone who can take it mind to a different place will get u through it. Find that place, I pick up my guitar it helps, you will become frightened and that makes it worse. I'm older and have dealt with it for many years . Be assured you're not dying. Keep a blood pressure pulse monitor with you, as you calm down your pulse will stabilize, save yourself time, money and embarrassment. Finding the proper med combination will help greatly, ur Drs, will find them. Talk weekly with phycotheripest don't miss appointment's. Help them help you!!!",1
"So am I and I'm slowing dieing inside. I wish everyday my heart would just stop beating in my sleep. My family just don't know how to deal with it or have their own opinions about me. I don't wish this on anyone but it they could experience this for a least one minute maybe they could have a little compassion. Complex PTSD, Acid Reflux, anxity, panic attacks, COPD. Dealing with this alone and been reaching out for help from Dr's and give me anti depressants and anxity meds. None work. Anxity meds make me to groggy so I don't take them. I can't work like this so I have no income.  Trying to survive physically,  mentally and financially.  Getting worse where I'm giving up hope to  keep looking for the right dr. I'm exhausted and wore out.",1
I struggle also but on to a new treatment. It is called tms therapy . My PCP is all for it. It has a 86 percent chance to cure you. I said it's better to try,1
"I get it. Sometimes I panic when my husband falls asleep even though he's right beside me, cause then I feel alone again.",1
I can't sleep and I try going to bed but my mind just races and I just think horrible thoughts and am so alone x,1
I have the same issue. Can't go on overnight trips or anything without severe anxiety,1
"Sertraline saved my life. Seriously. I've been taking it off and on for years and it's the only medication that works well for both my anxiety and depression. Note: Some docs won't tell you this, but make sure to eat with it. Good luck!",1
"Personally, I didn't react well on it.  After three days I couldn't stand it, made my anxiety skyrocket, made me dizzy and nauseous, light headed and just generally feel crap.",1
I took it at the end of last year for depression and anxiety. I found it made my anxiety worse for the first couple of weeks then it settled down. I never shook the awful headaches it kept giving me after a few months so came off it. Everyone is different though so just track any changes and if you aren't feeling better talk to your doctor about changing. I hope it works for you though!,1
"I am on sertraline 200mg for deoression...but feel it isnt working I just feel constantly down and scared it's effecting my marraige can anyome suggest anything?  I can't pin point what makes me down but its so hard to just ""snap out of it""",1
"My pharmacist : "" you will feel absolutely horrible for the first two weeks. Don't stop taking it though, you just have to get through the first two weeks.""

The first two weeks were god damn awful. 

In the end i needed a higher dose but i couldn't afford to go back to my dr. It helped my anxiety a lot ( i went from having multiple moderate to severe anxiety attacks every day to like one manageable one) but made me very... aloof. I wasn't sad anymore but thats because i couldn't really access any of my emotions. 

Not sure if that helps but that was my experience with it. I would consider going back on a higher dose if i could ( no health insurance at the moment)",1
"I've been on setraline for almost a year and had no side effects when I started but I've recently gone up to 100mg and im getting the worst brain zaps but they are helping so i just work through it. I have depression, anxiety and traits of borderline personality disorder and they seem to be working for me :)",1
I take 75mg for depression which works really well for me. I also take quetiapine at night (or through day for anxiety) and they work well for me.,1
"Started on it 2 months ago and it has been life changing for.i do have depression,anxiety and borderline personality. At first I felt ""flat"" and emotionless but then realised it was my background anxiety had stopped so my brain was quieter if that makes sense.i totally agree with the dry mouth.we are slowly increasing the dose till hopefully I will have peace x",1
"It affects us differently so don't be scared if it doesn't work for you. There's always others that you could try. But it could suit you fantastically so it's got to be worth trying. With myself, I was worried at first as I'd tried a few other anti depressants but after trying 50mg for a few weeks I realised it was good and went up to 100mg. There have been a few side affects on the way but not as bad as some others and in the long run, it's made a noticeable difference. Try it and see what happens and if it doesn't suit you then you can always try another drug.",1
I started on 50mg and then 75mg. After 3 weeks anxiety is definately much better.  I've been on sertraline for along time and lithium and both suit me well.,1
I take 300mg. It's not helping with my anxiety or my depression because they have added another antidepressant. I take 13 pills at night for bipolar with severe anxiety. I haven't experienced any of these side effects I have had no side effects at all,1
I love it!  I take it for my manic depression and it does wonders!! It doesn't seem to help me with my anxiety though.  We're about to up my dose to see if it will (currently on 100mg)  but yeah I get dry mouth a lot.  But it's a good way for me to have to stick to my 8 glasses a day.  Definitely worth the small side effect for the huge relief,1
"I was started on 50mg but it are.my depression worse. Also very dry mouth with it. Horrible medication to take. Everyone is different though. Give it time to go into your system
And see how u get on x",1
Keep a journal when you start so you can tell you doctor what if any symptoms you are having taking it.  I am only on Xanax for anxiety 25 mg.,1
"Started on 50mg.  Was increased to 100mg & then to 150mg.  I find it dries me up something fierce but that may be the mix of my other meds (carbemazepine, leviteracitam, & diazepam) as well.

I'd been told that higher doses of sertraline could work for anxiety as well as depression but right now I'm only indicated for depression.",1
I really struggled with sertraline... it made me worse,1
I take 200 mg I suffer with severe OCD and it has made my life so so much better it has also decreased my anxiety it changed my life!,1
"I'm not schizophrenic and I hear a voice that isn't my own mental voice. But I have dissociative depersonalisation disorder and PTSD. It's always a good idea to speak to your doctor about your worries, I believe there are tests that can help pinpoint the issue.",1
"Yes--a psychiatrist.  There are excellent treatments for anxiety and depression now.  Hearing voices can be many things:  psychosis due to your severe depression and anxiety, or a dissociative disorder stemming from some trauma.  This is something that may require some hard therapy, but the help is out there!",1
"Depends if it is two separate voices that sound different or like me I call them lots of ""me"" trying to talk to me in my head at once which get more noisey if I am anxious or depressed x",1
My sincere apologies to all who I offended. Yes Brigitte Garvin. As that trauma induces mental disorders. Thank you for your time. Signing off this website I thought it was for folks who had mental disorders and desperately seeking insight from others who also are seeking any and all insight. I'll try anything that has worked for someone else just to feel a little better. Just remember CMX  ,1
"I have been bipolar since I was 6 years old. I know about misdiagnosis!  49 years 45 of those years self medicating with alcohol and numerous drugs. Started at 12 years old. I've been medicated for 8 years now I've been on 10 different anti depressants 5 mood stabilizers librium zanax clonaxapam Chantix abilify well that's all I remember off the top of my head. Still haven't found a cocktail that works. I struggle everyday just to get out of bed and have for 12 years. Everyone I read about a mental illness that I'm not familiar with I have my provider test me for it. Paranoia will destroy ya. Someone in crisis asked a question and I gave an honest answer and sound advice   you kinda left that part out just sayin!  4 1/2 years ago I started to design a support group specifically for women with mental disorders once I got it all put together I presented it my psych provider. She thought it was awesome. 3 years ago she started this group nobody would even look up let alone talk. They are now thriving happy enjoying life some for the first time. I have been working on the next step for a year now, with the same psych provider. I am so excited to get the next stage implemented. it brings the greatest joy to my heart that my inspirations have made such a positive impact for 6 survivors. 6 out of 6   ",1
"Yes I have a heart! I suffer from several disorders I have been screened for schizophrenic as well as others. I have had the same psych provider for 8 years, we have discussed schizophrenia, bipolar 1 and 2 ocd ptsd anxiety disorder panic attacks paranoia adhd racing thoughts as well I have deeply researched these as well aside from being schizophrenic I have ALL of those disorders.",1
"There's many different causes of voices actually.
Trauma. Bipolar. Personality disorders. DID. Stress. You can't just tell someone they're schizophrenic do you not know how intimidating that is!! Do you have no heart?",1
"Take care of yourself first!!!  Let him go.  Completely.  Then start building up your self-esteem.  Do things you have always wanted to do.  Alone. Make new friends.   Move.  Live life.  Let go of all negative people.   Rely on yourself.  Only when you have started a new life and you are happy in that new life, will you meet someone who will enrich your life.  You don't want to be with a person who leaves you questioning or feeling sad and unsure.   I wish you all the best.  You got this",1
"Okay, every time I go to my GP they just offer me antidepressants. I finally found a counsellor who gave me different coping methods for depression. Not one person listen to me when I try and talk about the difference in my days. Some days I can hardly motivate myself to move other then to grab the worst of food and binge eat till I feel sick and online shop. Other days I wake up and I clean the whole flat in an hour and we are all up dressed and ready to get out the flat and spend the day out doing things that I can really afford. I find my hard day's are always triggers by the silliest things, someone told me I've done something wrong at work or I've felt the tiniest bit rejected by a loved one or I've been in a flunk for over an hour so now my whole day now ends up that way. Before learning slightly heather coping mechanisms i used to drink a bit, party hard and use sex as a way to escape from the overwhelming feeling of being stuck in my head. But evening with these new coping skills I feel like there is never just a normal day. I try to trust my GP and tell myself it's just depression and maybe it's anxiety that makes me feel like it's more then what it is. What are you thoughts?",1
Thanks for your reply. I hear that from a lot of people about kids giving them hope. Being without kids though I can't really relate to that one very much. I hear ya on music though. I have to listen to music everyday. So many songs give me a sense of meaning and empowerment. It's almost as if there's a continuous message to be taken from music that everyone can relate to. Your comment does help because I don't get out much and don't have any friends really (my own fault- social anxiety) and to hear from someone who I can relate to on some level also gives me hope. Thank you.,1
"Mood swings, no doubt.",1
Tristen does have bipolar but I do not feel the need to share all the details with anyone. The only thing I'm gonna say is she was the youngest child ever diagnosed with it by a psychiatrist at Scott & White mental health. Tristen also has a slight learning disorder so she does get confused about things. We did not wait a year for labs or meds to be given.,1
Three seems kind of weird. Also to be diagnosed at three and then not treating you until your 4? What exactly do you mean blood drawn at 4 1/2? I don't want to sound rude but I am here for information and support. I am new to all this and very scared. I would really be quite pissed to be honest if someone was saying they have a sickness they don't have.,1
That's just what my textbook says. Just like hypo and hyper blood tension.,1
"I'm 59 and when I was growing up mom was manic depressive.   We knew she was manic when she's be up in the middle of the night cleaning.  Sometimes talking to the wall etc.  I rarely mentioned her illness when young, stays in mental hospitals.   Now as an adult, her illness is nothing to be ashamed of, my momma fought the fight every day.  Love her RIP momma.",1
Sue Furst - I had no idea what you endured!  I wish I would have known - we have been dealing with Natasha's struggle with depression and anxiety.  Luckily she us doing very well right now.  I love Susie Q!,1
"Barbara I feel for you ♡  it's a tough tough illness.  My mother's struggle,  hospitals,  meds, electric shock therapy  (made her sad to think about that horror).  Her illness is why I chose not to have children :(",1
"Sue, I could have written your post. My mother suffered from severe manic depression. She was delusional. She thought people on the radio were listening to her and people on TV were watching her. She endured many ECTS and hospital stays. She would walk  around barefoot during the winter wearing only a thin spring coat while looking for cigarette butts left on the sidewalk. It was awful. I never had any friends over because I didn't want to have to explain to them why my mother was different than theirs. She died at age 54 from cancer.
My brother was Bipolar too. He committed suicide in Feb. 2010 because he couldn't stand being in pain all the time from depression. I am Bipolar too, but fortunately I am not suicidal. I struggle with depression sometimes for weeks at a time. I'm 58 and still trying to find the right meds to help alleviate the depression. My brother's suicide has really done a number on me.",1
This is me to theT I have severe depression OCD I've never been diagnosed with bipolar tho I over think everything and have horrible mood swing,1
"Lianne this is exactly my problem, my moods are so extreme, miserable and angry and teary and sulky, 5 mins later im overly happy over strange little things that yes, shoudl make one happy, but i just get like you said - giddy. Then within 10mins or so I'm back to moody. MI have anxiety/depression meds but am thinking about talking to my doctor about possible bipolar. but how d you go about this, i feel my dr will think im just overreacting",1
I was the same way. I was treated for anxiety and depression but I noticed the meds I was on wasn't really working. I tried several different kind. Then I found out that bipolar runs in my family. I talked to my doctor and I am finally on the right meds and I feel like a new person.,1
"I have citalopram for anxiety/depression, I think I'll make an appointment on Monday because I can't concentrate on anything anymore, just when I think I have a handle on it, I realise I don't!",1
I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 17 and I'm 28 now and what you have described it sounds like me it isn't bipolar it sounds like borderline personality disorder or unstable personality disorder turns out I was wrongly diagnosed at 17 so for 11 years I thought it was bipolar turns out it's bpd the difference between the two is bipolar the manic moods and extreme lows happen over weeks months where what I have got happens hours or minutes one minute happy laughing then upset and angry like really angry within a few hours I'm back happy again hope this has helped,1
"I find that I get ridiculously angry over nothing, like, scary angry! Then I can be laughing about the same thing an hour later. I'm constantly tired no matter how much sleep I get. I've had suicidal tendencies before, not so much now though, I hate everything and everyone and I don't have a filter, if I have something to say I say it, even when I know I shouldn't! I constantly worry about the smallest things yet the bigger things do t bother me as much. I'm obsessed with detail, I need to know everything about everything. I'm exhausted from trying to act 'normal'",1
"I've been thinking it's something more for a while now. I struggle to concentrate at work, I get so mad",1

In regards to bipolar:

Bipolar is a complex, mental health disorder.  Its most common forms are Bipolar I (mania and depression) and Bipolar II (hypomania and depression), however other forms do exist.  Due to the cyclic nature of this disorder, it is often times difficult to treat.  And because of society’s stigmatization of the disorder, those who are suffering from bipolar often times feel embarrassed or ashamed, leading to them not getting the help they need.

Bipolar I is the most common form of bipolar that society talks about.  It is characterized by a cycle of really high, highs and really low, lows.  Individuals with this type of bipolar may experience a period of “normal” mood in between mood swings, during which their mood and energy level feels “right” and their ability to function is not disturbed.  During the high periods, symptoms can include taking on too many activities at once, spending money in ways that cause trouble, becoming more talkative, outgoing or sexual, and consumption or increased consumption of alcohol and/or drugs.  These symptoms may lead to others perceiving the sufferer as strange or annoying and can cause trouble with co-workers or authority figures.  During the low periods sufferers often feel a lack of energy, a need to stay in bed or get extra sleep, and little or no motivation to do things they need to do.  They often put on weight during these periods and feel sad or depressed all the time.  Sometimes, during the low phases, they may feel helpless or even suicidal.  Their ability to function at work or socially can become impaired (Bipolar Spectrum Diagnostic Scale).  

Bipolar II is characterized by hypomania, meaning a slight increase in mood, followed by depression.  Hypomanic episodes are defined by feeling incredibly productive and happy.  Sufferers may see themselves as being in a high functioning mode and feel that there is nothing wrong during these periods.  The depressive episodes are defined by a prolonged period (at least two weeks) of feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and disinterest in taking part in life. During these low phases sufferers often feel fatigued, restless, agitated, unfocused, indecisive, and in some cases, suicidal (Bipolar Spectrum Diagnostic Scale).

Because bipolar involves both highs and lows, it can be difficult to treat.  If someone stays manic their physician will focus on bringing their mood down to a healthier happy.  This, however, can be difficult to accomplish as many people who suffer from mania enjoy the extra energy, creativity, and intensity that comes with it.  Likewise, it can be difficult to treat the depression that comes with bipolar because the medications used to treat the depression can unfortunately cause a manic episode.  It is also not uncommon for bipolar medications to stop working overtime, causing an individual who was once stable on medication to cycle and have to start the search for an effective medication over again.  Lastly, some of the medications used to treat bipolar are known for causing side effects in some people.  Knowing this keeps some people from trying medications that might actually help them.  

From my 14 years working with an adult psychiatrist and my 9 years as a licensed counselor, I can attest to the stigma many individuals suffering from bipolar struggle with.  Society has wrongly blamed bipolar disorder for causing people to commit horrific acts such as assault and murder.  Society has also misused the term in a negative sense to describe people they do not like, strange weather, mechanical issues with their car etc.; the list goes on.  These derogatory and inaccurate associations keep people from seeking help because they fear being diagnosed with bipolar and then being labeled as “crazy” and “dangerous” by their family and friends.  When I have a client that has received an official diagnosis of bipolar from a doctor, one of the first things I often have to do is work with them to see and accept that society is wrong, that they are truly not crazy or dangerous.  I then have to help them work through their fear of being out casted by everyone in their lives so that they can tell their mom or dad or best friend about their diagnosis and what they are going through. 

Overall, bipolar can be one of the hardest mental health disorders to suffer from.  It can present differently from person to person but it always has a component of fluctuating moods.  The best thing someone suffering from bipolar can do is think about how wrong society is about most things and then remind themselves that society is wrong about bipolar too.

The depressive state of Bipolar 2 can last for days or longer.  That is dangerous for the person affected because they are definitely at risk for suicide.  :(,1
Bipolar is just horrid x,1
"psychosis can manifest in extreme mania..trust me i know,ive had a few psychotic episodes where i was extremely paranoid and delusional..he needs help but he needs to want to get help...",1
His paranoia and delusions may get worse and that could be dangerous. He really needs to be hospitalized,1
"Honey, that's not bipolar, that's paranoid schizophrenia.",1
I have bipolar 1 and I had psychosis twice. I had to be hospitalized twice. I was very paranoid and was thought to be schizophrenic at the first hospital. I've been properly medicated for almost a year and a half and haven't had any delusions since being hospitalized. My parents had to call the cops on me the 2nd time.,1
"May not be bipolar at all.  He could have paranoid schizophrenia.  You may not be able to easily convince him to visit a doctor.  He may start assuming you are part of the ""conspiracy"" that's against him and fight against it.  Your sister-in-law may have to try to get him commited to a hospital in order to get him any help.  If there are moments of lucidity in his thinking/behavior (where he's less ill and more compliant), you may be able to talk him into going to see the doctor.  However, IF you do, don't wait to do it.  Take him immediately when he is willing to go.  He may cycle back into psychosis quicker than you expect.  In case you don't know, a person in full-blown psychosis can become violent or dangerous if they feel threatened.  Be careful how you handle him.  My best wishes are with you.",1
"I have a friend with Schizo-Affective Disorder + Paranoia, who has these issues but is open to, and grateful for help. However, their sibling is much more severe and sees everything and everyone as part of a plot. Obviously, help is needed, but resorting to trickery or sectioning could 'prove' the beliefs correct. Please seek advice and support from Mental Health agencies. Best wishes. X",1
He has paranoia.,1
"Firstly, don't assume anything unless you have a diagnosis. Secondly, it looks like you are going to struggle in getting that diagnosis. If he is over 18 and is either a threat to himself or others he can be sectioned under the mental health act. As an adult, he is also able to refuse treatment so unless he is willing to be seen by a health proffesional then he is going to continue to struggle unless you can convince him the his problems can be sorted if he does see someone. Good luck.",1
"I feel like worse days are ahead of me. Especially financially because I rely heavily on my mom for financial support. I'm on disability and I'm 30 years old now. First got disability when I was 19. Anyone on disability knows it's not enough to live off of. I can't handle the stress of working. I'm such a failure when it comes to being an independent adult. 

Sorry. Just need to vent somewhere.",1
"See, I don't deal well neighbors. Are you an upstairs neighbor? Well if you are. Stomping around really loud upsets them a lot. I'd slam my door extremely hard when they would do it. I'd even put my bass stereo on the floor and play whatever loud music you'd like. But my advice is prolly not the best. I dealt with young party girls moving in an out all the time. And I just ended up getting really passive aggressive towards them. Like they took up all 9 spots we had in the lot for their friends so I just parked my car where they couldn't get out.",1
"I would also try to reach out to the neighbor and gain their sympathy. Or , ask the landlord /manager if the door can be muffled or put on one of those hinges that control how fast or slow the door closes so that it closes slower. However, I have been in similar situations and have seen the supposedly gained sympathy and understanding bear little other fruit. It's harder, but much more effective to reduce your hope of changing other people's actions and try to decondition yourself as much as you can, even if it's just a little. Increasing your tolerance and flexibility will serve you and others the most in the long run. I also have a lot of anxiety and have been troubled by loud sudden noises. Ironically, I have an emotional support dog who also hates sudden loud noise, especially of the bang variety. His barking and my needing to comfort /quiet him have actually helped increase my tolerance of such sounds. Whatever happens, I have faith in your ability to find resolution! The situation can't go on forever. Best luck.",1
I never want to relapse but I often struggle with the hospital or home. I pretty much always want to die.,1
"Get upset and frustrated with today's society,   suffer with major depression, suicide is never off my mind, but in this day and age  there is no compassion, conversation, feelings or interaction, it's all about I want want want want, selfish people is all I can say. Sad but true        Sometimes a hug is nice!!",1
I was hospitalized about seven times this past year with depression anxiety seizures cause I dident take my meds for five days I've been on these since I was 10 but Id always taken them at night  was takin them in the morning now back too night I was hospitalalized for other stuff too and now six months later I'm doing good going and doing stuff I feel a lot better:) I have my friends back and a bf who is awesome:),1
"This is going to sound fucked up but I love being hospitalized.. yes, I have been put in restraints, given shots, woken up at 5 in the morning for blood, and miserable while in them, but they have taught me so much. I hate being in hospitals, but I hate leaving them. They are pure hell, but at the same time I never want to leave. It's the one place where I feel safe. Where I know I am not going to kill myself, because quite frankly, I don't want to die. I try to kill my self but I don't want to die. I have voices in my head who want me to die, I am not always in control. I am always scared of what I will do to myself, and that's why I like them. It's a safe haven, where people understand, and don't think your crazy. It's a place where you can not be afraid, and learn how to control the things you wish to.  Yes, I do self harm in hospitals, but I have people there to help me cope and learn other things to do. You learn life skills, that you don't find elsewhere. I hate them, and im terrified of them while I am in, but secretly love them at the same time. I mean I have spent so long in them, they are like a second home. I never want to be hospitalized again, but if I do something to be needed to go back, then I would go back knowing that it's for a good reason, am I need the help.",1
"sunshine, fresh air, music.  I made a conscious decision to put up with the troughs, because i love the peaks (although the beta blockers/diazepam get rid of 90% of the associated anxiety). As long as the PTSD doesn't synch up with the more extreme highs/lows then i'm pretty safe.",1
"No, this is not normal.  Get your thyroid checked.  Check your diet.  Med check--get you some buspar, get that exhausting anxiety in check.  Get some exercise--even just a walk around the block.",1
How do you like the adderal i started the smallest dose 2 times a day i only have maybe 2 ideas or chatters in my head at once instead of 50 but just cant start to fix my house so overwhelming,1
"Funny you should mention that, currently I'm on epilim for PTSD but found it's shot my vision... However I was trialled on ritalin once by my old psychiatrist but couldn't get my script refilled so far, (due to having to change psychiatrists and this one preferring epilim) but when I did try it short term it both fixed my fatigue and apathy massively AND slowed down my BPD and PTSD thought processes (including flashbacks) and forced me to be in the moment and mindful; so it definitely helped me massively, now its just a struggle as my psychiatrist has advised me I'll need to see a private psych on the side to get my benzos and ritalin managed because they aren't allowed to (nor comfortable with) prescribing either... same goes for my GP",1
Especially when you are mentally disturbed,1
"I hear the same thing daily..it just makes me worse    like why can't I just shake it off..why am I so weak. Tired explaining it to ppl, now I just say yup that's me a wack job. I really don't think ppl can relate unless they experience it. I am a horrible person most days..maybe it is all my fault    hope u get some support before you turn cold like me.",1
Ignore them.   You are the one living with it.   Took me 10 years to get here.  I was ashamed I had BP and I tried to hide it from others did me no good.   Look in the mirror and say I'm beautiful and I have a disease that does not define me than live your life trying to stay in remission.,1
"I am going through the same thing    my partner doesn't believe that Depression, anxiety and BP ""exist"" and that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance of the brain. Cannot argue with the man because he wont budge on his opinion. So annoying to deal with",1
"I agree with Babie. I had to threaten my mom with not having a relationship with me if she didn't stop treating me badly for being sick. I know that sound mean but what she was doing and saying was mean and I just sat her down one day and firm, but respectfully laid it all out on the table. The more I kno about being bipolar and the more I look back, my mom was too, just untreated..
 But if she stopped, for my health, I would have had to walk away. And, with your spouse, if they can't be supportive than that's not how ya love someone...",1
It's hard for some people in general to understand those of us suffering from Bipolar. Even when I was committed there where still people in my family who just didn't except the fact I was suffering from a disorder and believed my condition did not exist. To them it's all in my head and I'm in a mood or seeking attention. I've learned to accept that they are just not ever going to accept the fact that bipolar disorder is something many of us suffer from. All I can say i deal with each day as best as i can critics and all because I have a hard enough time just trying to get through the day let alone worry about what people in my family think. I truly wish I could have been more use. Take care.,1
It made me forget everything. My short term memory was all wacky. It was horrible. I got off of it quickly. Good luck,1
It has helped wonders for my bipolar and anxiety however I hate the side effects slowed down feeling burning and pins and needle feeling in feet and constant thirst then.. I love this medicine though but however it has caused me to lose a lot of weight and I've always been small and my doctor said if I can't stop losing weight he's done blood work to rule out health concerns and they were great but he said I'm losing to much weight as I'm already in a size 5 and can wear 4s he's said if it continues I'll be mal nutrition and it sucks cause it's the only medicine that's worked for my bp,1
I cried all day every day on it .. I was a mess. It was horrible,1
"I'm on it my dr is hoping it will help me with an added side effect of weight loss/appetite suppressant. I definitely eat less. I can't say I've lost weight. I'm still just in starting stages of testing it to see if it is a good med for me (dr took me off depakote and replaced it with topomax. I'm now up to 1 1/2 pills 2x for a week and then 2 pills 2x a day starting next week). Paired with Wellbutrin and adivan for anxiety, bipolar2 and clinical depression I'm beginning to feel a little bit normal again. It's still early and I still have rough days but it's getting better.",1
"Some people are on allot of medicatipn, but that is ok!!!! If it is helping don't worry about it!!! I went off all my meds and it was a mistake.. Just remember is not your fault and it's ok to take allot of medication. Everyone is different!! God bless! Oh and I'm back on them now and I'm grateful I have them..",1
"The best advice is #1-stay on your meds, it's when people with our diagnosis start thinking I'm fine or I hate taking them that they get into trouble #2-Stop feeling ashamed or thinking it is sad. Yes it sucks, yes it is a struggle every single day. Don't let it define you. Who cares what people think? In fact I am very open about it. Your journey can help so many people!!  ",1
I suffer from very bad anxiety and I am on Xannax and Clonazepam.  I do not tell people either except my parents and husband what meds I am on.  You should not be scared or discouraged because you are getting the help that you need!  Tons of people just self medicate and don't want to get the help so you are going in the right direction by seeing someone and taking meds.  This forum is great and everyone on here should understand.  Good luck and stay strong :),1
"My Mum does the same and I'm waiting for that phone call that tells me she's gone. Please seek out a professional you can trust; be honest & open about all this. The comfort you get now isn't worth the risk. You matter. You're stronger than you believe at the mo'. You ARE strong! Your prescribed meds are enough, so please think twice about playing Russian Roulette with OTC meds, however you feel. There MUST be somewhere to turn for support. Wishing you all the best. I'll be thinking of you. (( <3 ))",1
I take 900mg 3 times a day for severe anxiety,1
I take it 3 times a day myself for Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  :(,1
Dean Behnke gabapentin is normally used for diabetic neuropathy. They find it to be an effective and safe treatment for anxiety.,1
I take 1200 mg twice daily for severe anxiety. I have not had to use an anti-anxiety med in years!,1
The struggle is that real!,1
Wow me again. Sometimes I've told people what's going on with me. Then they either just walk away and not talk or just shake their head and laugh. So I stopped talking about it.,1
"Are you mobile, practise good self-care (washing, cooking, eating), as Laura said, they ask you to spell a word, repeat a sequence, do a simple sum etc... Also, how does your 'issue' impede daily life, and they observe your speech (fluent or too fast/slow/confused, and if you look well kempt i.e., clean and tidy. My default setting, even if I've not washed or dressed for three weeks, is to look presentable, and greet them with a plastic, friendly smile, and speak clearly. I was told afterwards that all went against me..They look for signs of anxiety v confidence via speech and body language. Do you need help to do any daily tasks. Good luck. Mine taken away in Feb., waiting for result in October. x",1
"p.s. I've had severe anxiety, depression, sociophobia and very severe insomnia for several years (reason private), having a lot of professionals involved in my case, a wonderful Support Worker, amazing support from one special friend who shopped, cooked and cleaned for me, as well as 4 surgeries 18 months ago, and was almost successful with a suicide attempt about 6 weeks ago. Heigh-ho :/",1
This isnt a prescription med but this seriously helps me!!! A company called M. Network makes M.Stiks and there is one called Soul and what it does is calms you down. Puts your mind to ease allowing the never ending thought of worry to die down. If you drink it a hour before you want to sleel it will actually help you sleep its all natural you put it in water it tasts amazing. If youd like a sample you can Pm me,1
I take klonopin 1mg during the day and 1mg at night .. I'm also on seroquel xr for bipolar 2... now the seroquel xr is NOTHING. Like reg seroquel.. it's a godsend and my anxiety has calmed down significant.. klonopin is longer lasting than Xanax and doesn't hit you as hard .. hope this helps,1

"You were doing well with your anxiety because of your meds, why go off them.",1
My daughter suffers from bpd and anxiety disorder which causes severe Tourette symptoms.  In all the years and baskets of meds the only thing that has made a huge difference is cannabis oil. Its truly miraculous.  P.S  its now legal in my country even though started giving it to her long before.,1
I have bipolar 2 and  general anxiety disorder. My Dr. Gave me Xanor SR. Slow release 2mg a day. It keeps me stable throughout the day. Seraquel 100mg at night for sleep. Xanor has kept me sane. No generic for it though.,1
Gabapentin worked miracles for me. For me it was like a benzo. Propranolol also worked for the anxiety in my body.,1
Buspirone.  Works awesomely for me.  I take it 3x a day.  I especially take it before I go to bed so I don't wake up hyperventilating cuz I'm having an anxiety attack.,1
"im on busiprone 60mg and do pretty good but it still shoots up suddenly, but this med has helped me more than any other. wow dont ever go off your meds. even on meds youre gonna have anxiety so i just learn to live with it but  the physical symptoms of it are hard to deal with, the hunger, the foot in your gut....stuff like that    good luck",1
I take Xanax 3mgXR and I drink celestial seasonings chamomile tea during the day to ease my anxiety. I was shocked at calming effects of the tea. Although as a warning it does make me a bit drowsy at times.,1
I hate bad grammar as much as I hate medications for free-floating anxiety (GAD),1
Same for me.  Works great.  I really like it.  Only anxiety/panic medicine that's ever worked for me.,1

"If you can't get a script right away try cbd oil, marijuana. It will calm your anxiety. I too have bipolar disorder 1, borderline, anxiety. It helps with the rougher spots. I take a mixture of medication for my bipolar and my anxiety. Many Drs today are trying to stay away from narcotics because of abuse. You may have to try a mixture of meds before you find the right cocktail that will work for you.  Good luck. God bless! And support groups are great if you have them available!",1
Hi Julie I have bipolar ll and anxiety I am currently on 450mgs Effexor in the morning and 10mgs olanzapine (zyprexor) at night. After years of different medications olanzapine has been the best one for my anxiety. Good luck.,1
I'm bipolar with depression and anxiety. I take klonapin (sp) it works really well it isn't as strong as xanax but it does its job.. Unfortunately my Dr doesn't like using it long term so I am working with her on finding something else that will work. I also suffer from anxiety related insomnia and it helps me relax and sleep,1
"I have bipolar, anxiety, bpd, and agoraphobia. I take the least amount of meds as I can now because when I was younger O was way over medicated and was like a zombie basically. I take wellbutrin for my depression and Xanax for anxiety. The Xanax is not working very well now because I have a tolerance for it, but it did help a lot on the beginning",1

I been doing unbelievable well on: Risperdal, Minipress (similar to propanolol, blood pressure med but works on anxiety/flashbacks), and Lamictal (mood stabilizer). I used to wake up in severe panic attacks each morning, and would have severe, prolonged manic episodes. A few weeks into these meds, and the anxiety and mania are GONE     . GOOD LUCK. It may also be helpful to you to look into joining DBSA (Depression Bipolar Society Alliance) and attending meetings.",1
I have tried EVERY med for anxiety,1
I started the propranolol for migraine prevention and two weeks later realized that ALL ANXIETY WAS GONE! I love this med!,1
I have rapid cycling bipolar 1 with anxiety im on 400 mg oxcarbamazapine as my mood stabilizer and then seroquel 300 mg is my antipsychotic and then Propranolol 80 mg is my anxiety med and migraine prevention med,1
"Husband is on Propranolol.  I'm on Gabapentin 3/day and Clonazepam.  Clonazepam knocks me out, so I can only use it at bedtime.  Since I was waking up with horrible panic/anxiety attacks (and I'm not any longer), it obviously worked for that.",1
I take Klonopin and my old daughter does as needed for anxiety and PTSD. My 14 year old takes a low dose of  Vistaril for same issues,1
"Xanax is best for me as I have anxiety and panic attacks. I need something fast acting. I don't experience general anxiety all day. It usually comes and goes. I drive, work, craft, cook, etc etc with no problem. I've been off it for wks and no withdrawals. But everyone is different. Mindfulness can help with anxious thoughts. Good luck   hope you find the best med for you.",1
"My first thought is get to your Dr. ASAP...and let them know what you are feeling...it has been reported that infusions of ketamine will eliminate suicidal thoughts for up to a week...dont know if that will work for you, but I would ask...your obsession is sort of like a seisure....not likely to get better on its own...wont pretend to know what you are going through...but some ssri's can cause these thoughts (known in people under 20 yrs old)....might ask to switch to another ssri....my symptom is fear not suicide....",1
"My parents are still in denial, my mom understands something is wrong, but not exactly what it is and my dad just tells me ""it's all in my head"", I mean duh it is lol but he doesn't mean it like that. I was diagnosed with depression at 15, bipolar and BPD at 23... Im 30 now and they are still telling me this haha. It frustrates me and makes me kind of upset when people don't understand, or make an effort to understand but still feel the need to put their 2 cents in . Im not religious, so when people give me that I get even more upset.",1
"I would probably explain to them that bipolar disorder is the same as having cancer. You can't just make it go away. If they won't accept that I would probably unfriend because who needs that crap (I say this as a person with both bipolar and with cancer. The bipolar scares me more, they cut the cancer out)",1
"My mom says shit like that to me. I tend to shake my head, smile, say I know, and then either walk away or make a joke about how God needs to stop testing me. It's hard to deal with people like that. They just don't understand.",1
"I stopped caring about people's comments, they are ignorant and I have too much I'm dealing with to entertain them. I just dont mention it to those kind of people anymore, my life is less stressful and I am at piece with my bipolar. At she point I tried explaining that its the same as having diabetes, u don't ask for it, it has no cure but can be maintained.",1
I've had many people doubt I am bipolar. Some doubt bipolar is really even a thing. I know the truth and have to be satisfied with that. It hurts. I share posts on mental illness in the hopes they can better understand. It's a struggle.,1
"To deny who you are is to deny the One that made you. If I where to be told something like this - that's what I would say. And then I tell them that their comment, while probably and in all honesty well meant, made me feel like I should be ashamed of who I am. I should feel bad for how I think. I should feel guilty for accepting that I have an illness. I should lie to myself, fight myself, tear myself apart because I can't be who I am. Then I would explain that by doing all those things - I would lose any ground I had gained to recover, cope, and learn how to ""be"".",1
"Bipolar is not a ""title"" to be ashamed of. It is just a way to describe brain functioning. Religion also has nothing to do with Bipolar either (and I am a Christian). Children of God can have all different forms of brain functioning, whether it be Bipolar, Schizophrenia, ASD, DID, BPD, ""typical,"" etc. Accepting Bipolar or any other mental health concern as a part of the self still makes one a Child of God. And then after saying that, I would include some helpful article links to help educate her and others on the truth about Bipolar.",1
"It would piss me straight off. Growing up, whenever I attempted to talk to my folks about my depression and anxiety, I was met with ""you just need to work on your relationship with the Lord and things will work out."" Every. Single. Time. Mental health conditions and religion are two separate things. So many Christians in this country can't see anything without trying to out a Jezeus stamp on it. Grrrrrr",1
"I'd want them to validate me in that YES I struggle with Bipolar disorder, that is not ALL that I am, it is not my identity, it is PART OF IT. Completely wanting to squash it is very ignorant in my opinion and they (and countless others around the world) need to end the stigma. Ps I have such issues finishing projects and lose interest after a short or long burst of intense making (knitting in my case) buy tons of yarn then get too apathetic and depressed to knit, so I feel you. Also I am Polish too which I thought was great that you mentioned    for the chuckle and for the way that it is a part of you just like BP and should be treated as such. Hope that helps.",1
I think they call it a label b/c they are uncomfortable with it  - ur not...its stigmatizing & they dont even know it,1
Hi I would have done what Briana suggested I know from my illness I get really upset at what's happened to you and so please don't let it get on top of you sweep i t aside and move on I have PTSD and people has said that I'm okay I do watercolours! Ggrr its so annoying how upsetting people can be with their big gobs!!,1
The same way you did because I feel the same way and do the same things..although I was never allowed to have friends in my previous marriage making new ones is harder for me because I'm afraid I won't be accepted with my problem,1
It dosent matter what ppl say but if u have a mental illness your not going to believe positive things I would know I'm struggling with three mental illnesses so I know the struggle is real hope this makes sense,1
I honest would get upset cuz I would feel like there downplaying  my issues and not taking it serious and acting like my mental health is a bad thing,1
"When someone says something like that it makes me feel like I embarrass them. I'm just trying to get a grip on it and accept it myself, please don't make me feel worse and question myself even more....",1
"When I was first diagnosed as bipolar, my mom kept saying that I wasn't. She didn't believe the Dr. But in the same breath eod say that she thought that the  (bipolar) meds WERE helping... I think that there is so much stigma on mental health issues that still clouds the truth today. I used to explain my depression, before the bipolar, like cancer. I can treat it. And it can go into remission. But it's never really gone. And i didn't do anything wrong, to get it, it's a sickness. Just like getting cancer. It can be hereditary. Things can happen in life that can make you more vulnerable to it. But you can't speak it into, or out of existence",1
BP depression will make you feel this way. I'm on an up swing and I'm terrified at the down swing.,1
My daughter was just on it ..she is 17 with bpd anxiety depression and adhd. This med aggravated the depression and made it worse..so she went back on ritalin.,1
Made my anxiety worse tbh,1
"Wow effexor is fantastic for bipolar and depression zero side effects when first taking it but DONT forget to take it you will get little head zaps and dizzy spells.
Im currently going through it as i type this message not that i forgot to take it i just dont have the money until tomorrow to fill my script. Its horrible   ",1
I messed up my first script on a small dose and took 2 a day instead of 1 and was left with 3 days with no pills thought I was dying of the flu horrible withdrawal. My doc doesn't want to give me anything else for my anxiety and bpd at the moment so I'm hoping this helps.,1
"There should be a Crisis Intervention service in your area.  You will find one or if its too overwhelming, pm me x",1
"Sharing this bc this fits it perfect, it's my exact struggle everyday.",1
Yes unless you suffer from depression and anxiety issues you will never understand how hard it is to live day by day and keep going like everything is normal.,1
"This is true for men as well, except I don't wear mascara. Have struggled for over 45 years now and care for my partner who is Bipolar.",1
It's a hole that seems to get deeper each day. You fear experiencing happiness even for just a moment because it won't last or something bad will happen. Nothing good ever lasts.,1
"It's a very deep, dark hole, that I so desperately want to get out of, to see the sunlight, but can't reach the top.  And, no, ppl that don't have it, don't understand,  even if they try.",1
"Very true.  Been there, done that.  Not proud of it either.  Ashamed.   Thanks to meds I'm on now, the mutilation part is over.  Just can't stabilize the depression.",1
sooo true its horrible & people dont understand wen u just want to stay home & sometimes just be on ur own cos u feel like shit,1
"To be ill is to be holistically affected in both neurons or nervous tissue and somatic tissue as  the brain influences not only itself but the holistic physique, the head including the whole self. 

Sure, neurons and somatic cells differ from one another, BUT, the neurons are in control over the somatic cells. 

The forebrain first begins to appear, together with the heart, in the human embryo at three weeks. 

Both brain and heart are connected by the vagus nerve.",1
"True,,but we can't feel others people's pain or do anything about it,so maybe selfishly it's about me and I shouldn't feel guilty.",1
"This is exactly the double standard that is forced upon those with mental illness.  Sure, someone may have it worse.  However, if the people who are ""normal"" would stop imposing their views on the mentally ill, there would be more understanding for the mental illness and no criticism, or, its companion, guilt.",1
The worst is when you're the one telling yourself others have it worse so you don't worry about yourself,1
"These things you're going through and thinking of are heavy burdens.  My biggest concern is your self medicating and self harm.  That's a DEADLY combination.  Please, please, be honest with your Dr and flat out tell them when you can.  But, first, you really should go to the hospital and get care.  Please.  They can monitor you, get you on meds that take away the thoughts and actions of self harm.  And that would be one less thing on your already overloaded plate.  I've been there with both self medicating and self harm.  Suicidal thoughts...ect.  The hospital will have resources to give you for support groups for all of your issues.  Take baby steps, and, yes, break it down to one day at a time.  I even break it down to one minute at a time sometimes.   Don't be afraid to reach out, like you're doing now.  It takes balls to do what you're doing!!  You're on the right path!!  Baby steps.  Reach out to all of us here.  Don't be afraid to pray and ask OUR HEAVENLY FATHER for help.  HE wants, and EXPECTS to hear from you.  HE loves you!!  HE will help you.  But, be proud of yourself for taking this first step!!  And, remember,  if the Dr you have isn't working with you or for you, find a new one.  It took me several before I finally found one I could be truly honest with.  I wish you the best, my friend!!  GOD BLESS!!",1
That was a devastating thing to have happen to you.  There are no words.  It's a tragic thing to happen to a child.  Of course it changes the child for ever.  Please don't let what happened define who you are now.  You can let it go and move forward with your life.  Make peace with the past and write your future.  Make it whatever you want it to be.  Find out who you are away from the pain.   You can do anything.  Find what makes you happy.  Don't worry about your sexuality.   It doesn't matter.   One day when you get yourself together you will meet someone to love and who will love you back.  Girl or boy.   It doesn't matter.,1
"Hey mee to. I told my mom and she to this day doesn't believe it. I also question me and also its affected my relationships. I have kids but when I'm with them I stress in a way that it distracts me. But hey...
I WOULD LIKE TO BE YOUR FRIEND.",1
"I feel for you so much. I know exactly what you are going through. I have alot of things from my past that has completely messed my head up good but this past year has pushed me to my breaking point, its been especially hard. I wont bore you with my life story or the details and im ashamed to admit I've resorted back to alot of my old bad habits just to try and get thru another day. I can't tell you how to fix it but I sure hope things get better. Its not fair to feel this low. Its not your fault.... I know that i don't know you but i can def relate and i hope the very best for you. I truly do.
I hope you find true happiness and it stays with you forever. Idk why but your post really stuck out to me, maybe because I'm feeling the same and i know how I hurt and i don't want to think of someone hurting this bad. Sending love ❤❤❤",1
"Before you get a girlfriend, you have to get your head together.  I also was sexually abused by men.  You're right...it affects every relationship.  However, help is out there.  Self-harm and self-medicating will not do you an ounce of good in the long run.  If you want a girlfriend and, maybe, children, you have to stop letting the abuse control you.  Master it like you would master playing the piano.  It is scary at first...but, with professional help, it is doable.  Build a support system around yourself and a close relationship with your therapist.  Choose a best friend, someone you can confide in.  Use these tools to rise above the abuse.  It is time to lance the boil and get the poison out!  I believe in you.  Believe in yourself!",1
"Malena Valentin you're right. However then you're confused, not actually gay. Food for thought.. ~Dani",1
Not always born gay. Many times when a child is sexually abused he/ she may be confused due to the abuse.,1
Look after urself. Sleep well stay away from stress. Do things u enjoy/  check side effects of ur meds. Maybe there alternative or you cud do better without certain meds if one giving  you lots of probs or switch to another,1
"I am also bipolar with anxiety and adhd thrown in.  I actually recently had a nervous breakdown and the thing that got me through was my journal and music. I reached out, and realized I had very little support, which really hurt.  I also have a therapist that helps me so much.  And meds of course.  But I am so sorry you are going through this.  You are not alone!  And when you're feeling really low, and want to bash yourself, try so hard to realize that you are important and worthy.  Be kind to yourself.  I struggle with that myself.  But you will get through this!",1
One day at a time and try to stay away from your triggers. And if that don't work you could face your fears and see if that works for you,1
"I could have written this post. My family has no concept of what Bipolar is. All they do is yell at me. My anxiety can get so bad that I lose it and can get nasty. My meds don't work. I've been on countless useless medications. I only see my psychiatrist about once every two to three months. Not good. I called him yesterday to change my anxiety meds. So far I haven't heard back from him. I will give him a couple of more hours, if he doesn't call back, I will call him again. I will turn myself into a pain in the ass if I have to. I really don't care anymore. My brother committed suicide because he could not stand the pain from depression anymore. Thankfully I am not suicidal, I just want to be given meds that actually work. I'm afraid to go to sleep at night because I know the anxiety I will wake up with. Oh yeah, I am raising my 13 year old grandson. It's very difficult. I'm sorry for rambling, thanks for listening.",1
"on the bright side the anxiety and depression are probably symptoms of the bipolar, so you actually only have one problem not three :) if you have BP1 then that might account for the psychosis too . in which case you are 1 for 4 .. a good result. Treat the BP and most of the other stuff is manageable.",1
"I want you to know, that you are not alone.  I, too, suffer from these disorders, along with panic, ptsd, agorophobia,  fear of ppl, and insomnia.  Many different meds though the years.  All I can suggest is therapy, if you're not already going.  Very important.  Don't give up on meds.  There are sooo many out there.  Unfortunately,  it takes time and the right combination.  Keep trying.  If they don't work, make the Dr try something else.  Also, very important, is if your Dr doesn't work for and with you, get another.  I've learned the hard way.  Try to eat regularly  (easier said then done), but force yourself if you have to.  Get 6-8 hours of sleep,  IF you can.  When and if I do sleep, I seem to handle all the muck better.  And, we all know exercise helps, though very hard to do when you feel like you do.  At least for me.  I don't know if you're spiritual,  but I do alot of praying.  I pray for the Dr's to find the right combo of meds, I pray for healing.  I cry out to OUR HEAVENLY FATHER  and spill my guts.  HE lightens the load.  There's a verse in the bible, among so many others, that I pray over and over again.  I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGTHENS ME.
Pick up the bible, say a prayer for something in it to comfort you.
Please don't feel alone.  If certain ppl don't understand, don't share with them.  Cry out to you Dr and find ppl that are there.  I'm here, I'll listen.   Reach out to ppl if you can.  I learned that the hard way too.  I don't know of any off the top of my head, but ask your Dr if they know of any support groups.  I hope at least one thing here helps you.  Get as many suggestions as you can, and pick and choose what works for you.  You are in my thoughts and prayers!!  GOD BLESS YOU!!",1
"I'm over sensitive and was diagnosed with depression, I stay awake most nights thinking about all sorts of things that make me cry.  I'm a marijuana advocate for the exact reason. Meds never worked for me and the only thing that ever did was that without the bad side effects like of other pharmaceuticals. My family would never support although it does really work. I wouldn't suggest seeing a therapist because they're all just strangers and I've always became extra anxious and paranoid when I got out because I would think I said something bad, or off. But someone close to you to confine in, like a best friend that wouldn't hold anything against you. I just recently came out with my problems to a few of mine, and it does seem to help a little,at least know you're not alone.   ",1
Spend outdoor activities with your close friends that boost your self esteem and don't overthink about anything because it can cause anxiety and depression . just think positive always and take your meds.,1
"I have psychosis as well.  I have a bipolar component to my illness as well.  I know exactly what it is to have to try to function with those things in and around you.  All I know is that...when you get the right meds with the right Doctor/NP, as I have, your functioning goes up.  It can be crippling and people don't care.  Of course, they will tell you to snap out of it.  It is because you are the uncomfortable truth that they would rather ignore and sweep under the carpet.",1
I would suggest seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist...I have intense depression and anxiety. And bpd and autism and a few other things ..I feel like I'm all alone too . I  just started with a new therapist cuz  I moved to a new living  environment       In may or April and I just got a therapist in August . Just two weeks ago .. I have maybe two friends who understand my struggles but my parents don't get it at all they  say it's acting out or attention seeking ..  they tell me there's nothing wrong and I should not feel that way . Some of my family say why can't I just be happy and they want a happy sister . They say don't sweat the small stuff . And it's no big deal . They say I'm exaggerating. They never have  understood it . They thinks it's bs . My family wants me to snap out of it to . I'm not on meds which makes it almost impossible to cope and live.i feel like I'm definitely bout to lose it and go off the deep end I think I already have,1
"My story is similar to this. I have severe anxiety that often times it cripples me. My family is like. Just breathe. Yeah, well it's not that easy. I suffer from major depression too and spend a lot of time in bed. It's the only place I feel safe.",1
M8 its so hard when u suffer from mental illness iam in my 30 and still struggle day to day to keep it together,1
Hi.... I've been where you are right now. When people don't understand they are afraid of all the stupid stigmas about us. There are support groups. They are really helpful and some communities have casual drop in places and you will see that others there are great people.,1
You've just said it in one sentence...write keep writing an learning bout how to manage what your goin through I have all of the above an a 9 yr old son with autism I write poetry to raise awareness for mental health an for my son an all it is my life on day to day basis made into poems great for anxiety also I've just started to do 2 min meditation of mornin that helps me stay calm in situations I usually can't handle hope things get better for you .,1
"I noticed after journaling, that food effects my moods. Carbs but esp sugars, give me severe mood swings, and make me very irritable and blah. I do clean eating w daily (least 5 days a week in gym). It's amazing what a difference I feel! Of course there are still bad days. But overall I'm very stable. It's just very hard to stay disciplined and without consistantly and not eat dessert, but.......it's been working for going on 2 years now.",1
"The bipolar disorder survival guide by David J. Miklos it,  PhD, and mind and emotions by Matthew McKay PhD, Patrick fanning and Patricia Zurich on a psychological.  Have helped me. Along with what you mentioned I also have severe adhd ptsd and panic attacks. Fetzima has also helped a lot. As well I have racing thoughts.",1
"As far as keeping your ducks in a row, you need to keep a notebook. Write down info about meds, moods etc, whatever is relevant to you. It'll help a lot. 
And for support, I'd suggest joining a few bipolar support groups on Facebook. It's amazingly helpful to have a group of people who understand your struggles. 
Best wishes to you xxx",1
"And hv u felt a lot better since on new mess, I've struggled and was first diagnosed at 14 with manic depression but wouldn't take any medication and as got older having ft chiyoung it was tough and through a baby equipment loan service got close to a worker there who introduced me to start of her other career in teaching all ability class,s which I went to to support her and within 2 or 3 years

up and down and left my ex partner because I started being violent with him which obviously ended up both ways and new myself it would cause damage they had seen to much so decided only way forwArd was to split and bring my kids up using my career as a fitness instructor and aerobics instructor to feed my bring rather then those mess to finally moving 6 years bk I can't get in detail but new if didn't leave I was starting to sink my daughter was going through to much trauma to deal with what was happening to eventually giving in and said I'd take the medication any thing from mood

look like they only care about how I feel and wear I'm at in life and hv bonded with them instantly they make my jaw ache with laughing and love seeing them just through knowing there there for me and gv mean little push to trying to get bk to going outdoors starting art therapy they hv made a huge difference and getting bit emotional because of the difference they've made I hv the best cpn ever

well done to the ppl who created this page as so many of us need somewhere to reach out sleep well a good nite xx",1
I always dream that I'm dreaming.  In my dream that I dreamt about I'm dreaming about dreaming and in the dream I'm upset because I can't remember what It is I've dreamt.,1
Yes and it sometimes scares me,1
Trying to differentiate between dream v reality.  Distressing,1
"Its me,always..but decided to keep quiet because afraid if i tell someone,they will think i am crazy     ",1
"Yes,  scary",1
Me all the time its beginning to scare me,1
You did great celebrate the steps you took.  Even without BPD you would be nervous about the next steps to take to secure a job.  We always think the worst because we have the illness.  I try to just worry for the day anything could happen tomorrow.  You have a better chance of something wonderful happening tomorrow than something bad.  I will pray for you but you have this.,1
"positive anxiety, positive elation - sometimes they mirror symptoms of BP and make us freak out - but don't be fooled. They are *good*. They are normal reactions.",1
"Good luck!!!  Deep breathing, try to relax.  It's  normal to be nervous!  It's an uncomfortable feeling but it can't hurt you.  Believe in yourself and do your best.  I wish you all the best.  Keep us posted!",1
Stay in the moment.     don't worry for now. 99% of worry doesn't happen.. All the best. X,1
"Deep Breath.
Now another.
You are ok. You're going to be ok.
It is always ok to succeed and it is ok to fail.
No matter what happens, everything will work out.

You're impressively strong and courageous. 
You've made it this far!!!
Hugs!

*anxiety, depression and ptsd.
Like me, you're more than just a survivor; you are a champion!",1
It helped my depression more than my anxiety x,1
I'm the exact same way.  I worry and worry and every month the bills are paid.,1
"I understand I'm
Struggling mentally and 
I'm definitely tortured inside",1
"I was on geodon for a long time and I did have tremors, they weren't bad, but annoying. Make sure to tell y our doctor, if it is bad there can be damage happening and the tremors can be permanent in some cases. I had a very bad time on geodon for other reasons and despite complaining to my psychatrist for almost 2 years he refused to take me off it. finally when I got better insurance I went to another doctor who quickly weaned me off (he worried about my side effects and the high dosage I was on, but it was a more powerful drug than my symptons called for).",1
i take neulactil there only 2.5 mg but 2 of them with valium seem to help me go to sleep  they calm the body down from anxiety & help you sleep better,1
"quetiapine. It's a mood stabilizer and sleeping pill in one shot. I take 5mg of diazepam with it in case I get night terrors. Ask your doc, everyone is different but proper sleep is crucial",1
"Ambien is extremely helpful for me along with Tegretol, Valium 20mg, Seroquel 200mg, and hydroxyzine 20mg. I am diagnosed with bipolar,mixed,severe and had insomnia for 2yrs+ that really took it's toll me. Up for days, little sleep, isolated, lost dramatic amount of weight, etc. Ropinarole is very effective with restless leg syndrome and I take that am and pm, very helpful in settling me down to a more comfortable level.  Abilify is also another sleep med that seems to be very helpful to some,but did not work for me. So there are other medications to help you. Can you get to see your provider on an emergent basis or maybe discuss with your provider's nurse who will be your voice? I ended up hospitalized for almost 3 weeks and would not be discharged until my sleep stabilized. I was also wrongly diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety for years. So many factors can be considered when insomnia is uncontrolled. My case is extreme and I was a mess, but not something I had control over. You have to advocate/speak up for yourself. I also had my husband with me before being hospitalized to substantiate my condition. Plus, it was a legal intervention because I ended up in an uncontrollable, destructive rage. Scared the hell out of me and my family. Wishing you the best and hope your provider takes you seriously.",1
Seraqual made me sleep wish i could take it but they took me off too manny side affects light headed dizzyness and nausea sucked cause i did sleep well  now on just abilify if i  cant sleep hes gonna give me something and a anxiety med i suffer everyday meds suck unless you find the right ones i hate not being abel to sleep,1
"I use busparone for anxiety and it stops the cycling thoughts too. Taking benzodiazapines like valium, Xanax, etc. just sets you up to fail. You will continue to need larger and larger doses over time. Those medications are addictive. Most psychs where I live won't prescribe them any more. Busparone has been a wonder drug for me. I take 15mg twice a day. At night I also take Seroquel for sleep also, but if I don't go to sleep right away for some reason, I have visions and lose all of my ability to judge distance and can't walk around or I'll fall. It helps me pretty fast though.",1
"I learned the same in the hospital. It breaks the anxiety cycle but you really must actually do it, and it will also help your concentration.",1
Same. It's a miserable existence.,1
Tired + Wired = MISERABLE !! ...I've had insomnia for over 6 months now..nothing has helped and I've tried everything you can think of...changed meds ..times taking meds... 2-3 hrs of sleep in 24....body is exhausted but my brain is going a million miles an hour :(,1
"I have also struggled with depression. dated a shrink, gone to shrinks,  taken thier meds, ,  played thier game. Nothing worked until I began to see the huge conspiracy that was causing my depression. I have overcome depression with no help from the pros , but from my own critical analysis of what is going on, along with honest feedback. I am willing to tell more if you like.",1
Yea my son think about it all the time he would be better off died I just pray everything will be ok he's going through depression and anxiety really bad since my grandmother pass in 2015,1
"Go to the emergency, never be afraid or ashamed to do it ever please. We have all been there",1
"I have been close, back in May, in fact, due to my sister's arguing while my father was battling cancer.. I even wound up in the psych ward for a week... I like to call it ""The Looney Tunes Bin"". Since then, my father has passed away due to this terrible disease... I haven't been as close though, even though my sisters are still fighting, and have decided to put me in the middle.. I hate playing ""Dawn in the Middle""... One thing that anyone struggling with these tempting thoughts should keep in mind is the definition of SUICIDE.  It's really just A PERMANENT SOLUTION TO A TEMPORARY PROBLEM... Lately, when I get these types of thoughts, these steps help...  1) stuffed animal 2) crawl under a warm blanket 3) cry.",1
Well first let me say I'm so sorry your feeling so badly . And also I can definitely relate . Story of my life . U totally took the words out of my mouth .. going thru the exsAct same things ..you are not alone.  I understand . I struggle daily with lack of self love and respect . I'm always suicidal and I want to end it all . I have very few friends too . I've lost many friends to . I'm always feeling so alone and lonely .. omg . I definitely think the world would be better off with out me and I always say it ..I'm currently not working either just volunteering..just  social security. ..so I just wanted to say everything your going they makes sense to me and I'm here if u want to talk .. there are ppl who care and  will take u serious,1
Hi there. I am so sorry that things are crappy right now.  Please go to Emergency at the hospital. Be very clear as to how you are feeling and no sugar coating it.  It is so scary but you have all of us here.  So hospital now sweetie and you will be safe,1
Hang in there. I struggle too. Am today...but I know if I wait it will lift and I will feel better again. You aren't alone! And you're cared about more than you know. I know I speak for many of us when I say if you need to talk we will be here. You can always email me at christinagrice72@gmail.com if you don't want to message me on FB. You can be as anonymous as you wish. Please don't go it alone.,1
right now prayer n self love honey hope this helps god bless you i know the struggle of tthe same all to well life WOULD MISS YOU regardless all the love,1
"Honestly, talk to your counselor. If you don't have one, get one. There are low income clinics that go on a sliding scale. When I was going, it was completely free because I have literally no income.
Otherwise, look into ways to change your thought process. When my thoughts turn dark like that (which is often) I yell in my head STOP and picture a giant stop sign. I then go and do something physical. Either coloring, working with plants, or working with the dogs. 
If these things are not helping, I will ask my personal service dog to come and task help me. Avoid caffeine if you can, it can actually make anxiety and paranoid thoughts worse. Take a warm/hot shower. Do grounding techniques, you can google this and go to images and find lists of things to do. 
Here's a cute picture of my girl to hopefully make you smile a bit    if you need to talk, my inbox is always open. I'm not very good at carrying a conversation, but I will always be willing to let you vent about things bothering you.",1
"Laurie Hollister thank you! Since I lost my Therapy, I've had to find ways to cope on my own. I know how it is to struggle with suicidal thoughts, and I know the deep need to get help and want to just be ok. 
If my advice can help, then I'm happy.",1
"That depends on your individual disability. 
For me, she helps with my C-PTSD, Depression, and Bipolar.
I trained her to help by watching my back so no one can spook me, she alerts and responds to my raising anxiety, interrupts depressive episodes, and responds to rising manic episodes.",1
Distraction!!!!! When I get like this I am my own worst enemy. What I find best is to take myself out of my head until the phase passes. Last Christmas I was the same way - I was done. Sounds stupid but I coloured every time the thoughts overwhelmed me. The distraction allowed me time out of my own head until the adjustment in meds kicked in. Please know that the world is NOT better off without you xxx,1
"Be prepared for the weird looks and the ""i'm not looking for anything serious"" excuses, but you have to tell them asap, otherwise they might break you out of ignorance, spite or scorn, they might also make you feel guilty. You don't want any of that, you need someone who understands or with an open-mind to accept to understand your situation, these are very rare.

As for me, I timed the people who stay, 4 weeks and then they disappear completely.",1
I would live in the moment especially as you are well enough to date at the moment. If you experience any symptoms during your courtship live in the moment then and talk about it if you feel you are having an episode. And if you are unwell remove yourself from each other until your feeling better. That's me you cannot predict the future and you need to get to know each other first. Don't scare them off we all have periods of normality and who knows if your happy it may not be an issue. Sometimes self disclosure is better kept to a minimum.. All the best.....          ,1
I always tell people that is interested in being friends with me or romantically envolved with me at the beginning. So they will understand the reason for my actions or me needing my personal space. When one doesn't know it's always quick to judge that they're insane. And you'll be surprise on how many suffers the same thing but to embarrass to talk about it until the other talks about it first.,1
you have to be honest otherwise keeping it in will only make you worse by worrying about it,1
"I've never really ""dated"" so I don't know how that works. I've never been in a relationship with someone who wasn't a friend first even if there had always been a romantic intent from the beginning (by my own choosing, I feel more confident in a person if I know them as a friend). Therefore my previous partners all knew about my mental health issues a long time before they stepped into a romantic relationship with me. 

What you need to be prepared for is that sometimes even the most well intentioned people will not understand the truth of how these issues will effect both of you and your relationship. You can give full and honest disclosure yet the rose coloured blur of new love will sometimes cloud a new partner's judgement making them think that ""love conquers all"" and then, when the dark and honest truth unveils itself it comes as a shock or a nasty scare. Don't blame yourself for that, allow both you and your partner everything you need to learn how to deal with it, together and how to look after yourselves through the ups and downs. X",1
I agree none of their bussiness till after a few dates and you feel you can trust them not to take advantage of you. Till then if you feel the funk coming on and they want to see you just avoid it. I have experianced when someone knows right off the bat it has not turned out well been taken advantage of played games with my head like i had to question my actions run for the hills and the guys i waited to tell have said i never notice the nice ones i would say really i am bat shit crazy. The whole time i would be with them i would fight the head chatters and seroquel i could not take or i would take a nap. But now I just figure its to much a pain i attract toxic people so if some nice man comes my way great if not o well,1

I'm a mess. I struggle daily with this. I stay away from people because I don't want them to see my pain or what I have to go through. They wouldn't understand it and I can't explain it to make them understand. So I hide from the world in silence. I don't have a life.",1
"Feel like dog shit today. Irritable. Fed up. Sick & tired. But still went to work. Stayed all day. Went grocery shopping. Now football practice for the teen. Gonna make myself walk during his practice.

I've been fantasizing this the past few days. Feeling a lot of anxiety these days too. Fight or flight?,1
"I think that's what is unclear and giving me anxiety, what am I working and living for? I'm just starting to build my life after years of spiraling down neglecting myself. Just started working again after taking a couple years off to get healthy. Dealing with anxiety and depression coming up as I take on more responsibility. Especially today. I guess I need to do what we all need to do sometimes, take some deep breaths, be kind and patient with myself and trust in the process of transition. I don't know exactly what I want to do with my life but I'll find out while I do what I have to do",1

Do you take meds? And yes certian people take all my energy i avoid that a all cost but i live a lone so it is easy but i would get anxiety and depression the longer i had to be around them. So like groups drain my energy to. Ask you doctor or therapist about help for it if you have to live with them try to build your owen space expain why you need it in a medical mannor,1
I try to structure my days. I write a list the night before. Not a long list because that overwhelm me. I always start with a shower. Of course it doesn't always work out. I'm glad you are trying to address your symptoms before they get worse.\,1
I'm 26 weeks and these 26 weeks have been hell to say the least. Depression and anxiety are off the charts and I had PPD with my first born. Wanting to breastfeed with my son who is due in November but not sure how much more of the roller coaster of emotions I can take.,1
"First off feel free to private message me if you want to talk. Second I've been off meds now for 3 years. I came off of them in 2014 so that I could conceive my first son. We knew after my oldest was born that we would want more children, and since I was on lithium which is hard to get on and off of we decided just to keep me off of my meds. I'm now almost 36 weeks pregnant with our second child. I'm due in mid-september. After my first son was born I had postpartum depression. during the pregnancy I did really well until the end when my anxiety got high. this time around I haven't been doing so great, and I wouldn't recommend asking me any questions unless you want my God's honest truth experience. I don't lie to people. But if you want more information feel free to message me I'm happy to talk. Or at the very least if things get rough I'm happy to be a shoulder, because trust me I understand.",1
"I have bp2 and ptsd. I have been on a lot of meds over the years. The #1 thing that I have learned is just because something works for someone else, it doesn't mean it will for you. All our chemical makeup are different and we all metabolize things differently. It took a long time for me to find a good balance but I STILL have periods where I need extra meds when my regulars don't hold quite enough and I spiral down or start getting a bit out of control. Luckily I have had this disease long enough to be able to recognize the signs usually and to get help before I'm in trouble.I have been on Topomax for about 15 years now for both migraines and the bp, and at a high does have had pretty good control with the bp. I only wish it worked as well on the migraines. I also take Cymbalta for Fibro and the migraines. If I begin to feel that I am having issues with the bp, my doc places me on Lithium E.R. 75mg for a short period to help me get through or advert any crisis.I also take anti- anxiety meds due to the PTSD. I hope this help you some. I have been through many doctors and the best thing I can tell you is to stay informed, know what meds are out there, what there side effects are, and what is available to you on your ins. If you don't have ins. A lot of the pharmacies, like Wal-Mart's $4 list, have list of medications that are a reduced price,or there are prescription discount cards that will help knock down the price of you script, you simply put in the name of the drug in their search engine and it tells you which pharmacy will be cheapest and it gives you a coupon to print for that price. If it hadn't been for that program last year, Med Rx, my family wouldn't have been able to have gotten half of our meds we needed, and it costs nothing to participate. Good luck to you.",1
I've been on lithium for over 20 years and it has made a world of difference. I won't change it. I'm also on paxil to help with depression. I still have my moods but bit as bad as when I was unmedicated. Also take adivan for stress and nerves. Helps with anxiety and panic attacks.,1

The past is not worth worring about its gone you have no furture if you are living in the past is what got me out of it. If you have like a record from your past that always runs in your head write it down. You can worry about the future you dont know what it is dont fear it. You can write out your plans for the week let it go. You can always make goals for the future and write it down. I write stuff down cause like you my head was pack with confusing stuff i had no way to change or predict. I hope this makes sense sometimes i dont even make sense to myself lol,1
"Me too. I've tried to talk to my docs and therapists, but no one realizes just how desperate I am for real sleep. Without the vivid and chaotic dreams that leave me even more exhausted.",1
"It's not uncommon for medications to stop working as effectively over time.  Your body becomes habituated to the meds and you need something else to help control symptoms.  You may also be under more stress in your life than you realize right now.  Stress definitely can have an effect on how well your medications work.  Talk to your doctor.  Sounds to me that your anxiety is what's not being controlled as well right now.  Your doctor may be able to give you something else for your anxiety that might work better for you right now.  Anxiety definitely can result in irritability.  My husband is that way...if he gets anxious, he can get irritable and aggressively grumpy.  Please explain to your family and friends that you definitely don't mean it.  You love them and you're sorry if you hurt them.  You need your medications adjusted.  If you explain and apologize, they may be willing to let it all go.  

And you may need to find another job...something that is a better fit for you personally and that doesn't cause you to feel paralyzing fear.  

My best wishes are with you.",1
"It is such a destructive illness and everything is so much more complicated in a relationship where Bipolar is present, I know as I am the partner in one. Loving a partner with Bipolar is difficult. The Bipolar turns them into somebody that you don't recognize, somebody that's not the real person you fell in love with. Instead of being an equal partner in a relationship you are expected to be a carer when they suffer depression and you have to suffer the emotional abuse often on the other end of the scale. Bipolar has robbed me of all my trust in my relationship but I am hanging in there. Perhaps your partner is afraid to face the bipolar situation? Afraid that he has lost the person he loves? It's lonely being the partner of a sufferer, I sometimes feel alone when I am sitting in the same room as my wife. Escapism, to a certain degree, is natural. Who doesn't want to escape the one thing that worries and stresses them out the most? Us guys just want to take care of our loved ones and families but when I feel there is nothing I can do I feel worthless and not up to the task, a failure. That can be destructive. Mental illness is not fair, Bipolar is not fair. I would recommend returning to counselling and also for both of you to learn more on Bipolar together. I find going over literature together helps even repetitively as it refreshes what the illness is and what it does. I constantly strain to separate the illness from the person. Good luck.",1
"I too am Bipolar along with Schizoeffect, anexity and paranoid disorder. I am unable to work full time, due to the Schizoeffect. I constantly think someone is watching me or trying to hurt me. My support system is my mom, brother, therapist and psychiatrist. I take my meds as prescribed. I don't advertise my illness so not too many ppl kno. I don't go out often ether. But since I live with my family they don't push. They ask if I wanna go do something. If I say no they don't pressure. They ask me if I wanna go somewhere with them. No one will ever understand Bipolar unless they go through it in my opinion.",1
"You don't know me but somehow I ended up here. Ditto to your story. I lived a lifetime of struggling and trying to figure out what's wrong with ME.

"Oh it sure is love, just took my kid to the park at almost 8pm to avoid as many as possible     ",1
I'm just very self conscious and very insecure about how I look. I'm a female u know . We have those issues . I've struggled with low self esteem since I was  around thirteen maybe even before that . I'm now 29. Society and the media have me feeling so very bad about myself and I honestly have so much self hate ..I just have a very bad self  image and I'm always comparing myself to the pretty good looking cute girls that I wish I could be but I will never be cuz I'm just trash,1
"Lisa I'll tell you what i think, I think you're very beautiful NO BS! You have a great completion and nice features! You have nothing to be ashamed of at all! Learn to love yourself! Seriously I know it's hard because I feel the same way about myself, but I'm working on it and I hope that my perception changes just like I hope it changes with you!!! Do you Lisa, and remember that your heart ❤️ and personality are what's most important!!! I hope this helps!!!",1

I struggle with some of those things to .. I have bpd and depression Anxiety  I have very intense worthlessness I feel completely mentally drained .. I'm so close to ending it all . I can relate to a lot of  what ur going thru,1
"If I may ask what medications are you on? I am on Zyprexa, Prozac and Lamictal. And do you go to therapy, not just a psychiatrist? I have been where you're at and it is horrible feeling. The best I know to do is to keep going to therapy and getting my thoughts and my feelings out.",1
Some people just cant comprehend how bad the depression and anxiety hurts and the judgement that i got from a job was to much for me i am disabled cause of my illness and it is so hard to getn people to understand,1
"Contrary to what people are saying about him not being the one, I can say from experience that it's not necessarily true. My boyfriend never understood depression or anxiety until I started sharing material with him. Endless material about others experiences whether they share my disabilities or have something else. The Mighty has plenty of articles that are well written and relateable. If he's willing to read and learn, and most of all listen, continue to try! We also started couples therapy at 2 years and it has really helped him see how much he relies on me while he's away at work and just how big my heart is, how much work I do w his kid, and just how hard I struggle every day to get up and get by. If there's a system and a way to help him see, there is hope. However if he isn't willing to try to learn, to listen, to talk, to help and understand, then that's when you need to walk away for your own well being.",1
I'm so sorry you are going thru this.  I have bipolar 2 also and anxiety for ten years and have been married for 13 years.  My husband will say sometimes I want my Debbie back.  This hurts because I've never stopped being Debbie.  Just now I have a battle everyday living with this disease.  But that is the catch you have it and you have to do what is best for you no matter who does not understand.  A big part of mental illness is doing what is necessary to help control the symptoms.  I will pray you find peace for you and your bf.  put please take care of you first.,1
"I ache for you.  It's hard, because he doesn't understand your desire to stay shuttered in your down time, and you can't easily force yourself to go out..  My wife of 26 years wants nothing more than to sit home and watch movies, living life vicariously, because of severe social anxiety.  We've come to a compromise.  I have recently discovered an interest in theater, so that's my outlet, and her love of movies and theater gives her the opportunity to get out and come see what I'm doing.",1
"So my hubby and I are both bipolar. It's not easy. Relationships are hard work. That said, if your bf isn't supportive, or willing to work with you, make compromises, then you will be miserable. But I also want to say being around people who are not bipolar is important in your journey to being independent and well. Maybe find some books, do some research, find what works for you. Finding a distraction from the negatives will help you out of those odd anxious feelings. I personally believe that diet, sleep, exercise, hydration, and supplements help so much with regulating your body and brain chemistry. I found that birth control, caffeine, sugar, and synthetic dyes, all affect my mood negatively. Where ever you are on your journey, you can always improve your experience with knowledge and personal trail and error. Don't let anyone bring you down or put you in an uncomfortable situation just for they're own sake. Your worth staying home for.",1
"I'd like to say it means he isn't the one. I had a relationship like that, I felt guilty for wanting to stay home always and didn't want to bore my gf. You just gotta find people and friends who take care of those quirks you have. Regardless of the mental disorder you're a human and have rights to your feelings.",1
I agree. U don't need all that pulling u down when ur already struggling x,1
He obviously dont care how you feel let alone he will never understand you im sorry you struggle this way and i know just how difficult it can be im sorry for him throwing away someone so special take care be strong and remember you're not alone,1
"I think you are reacting to the word imbeciles. Well, if he does not understand the ""point"" I believe he has little to no understanding of the needs of people diagnosed with mental illness. You maybe do not understand the daily myths and stereotypes that I and others deal with everyday because others do not understand the""point"". Education of society is the overall point, but daily to find support can be exceedingly difficult. So what is your ""point""? Words too big, maybe stupid, idiot, or dumb would help you understand. Because I do not believe you get the ""point"" either if you do not believe people with a mental illness typically are isolated in society, desperately need support from people who have experienced the degradation of these illnesses and can be helpful and insightful.",1
I don't know I struggle with it everyday my mom is In my living room in a hospital bed on hospice I know they r slowly killing her with morphine I don't see the point in her suffering y does God do this to people y isn't there a cure for cancer y do the good die young. No point in life my mom is 57. Her mom died at 49 of lung cancer n now she is facing the same struggle when she goes I want to jump in the hole with her cause really what the hell is the point,1
"There is no point. When you stop looking for ""the point"" to everything, you learn to enjoy the good time more and let go of the bad. When I realized this, I stopped feeling so stressed and stopped feeling like a failure. No point, just wonderful, messy life.   ",1
"I would not be stable without it. My insurance will not pay for XR, but I have had it in the past and that would be my preference. I have gained weight but not horribly; you just have to be careful as far as diet is concerned. I have other physical issues which makes it hard to exercise.  Just watch the carbs.  I take 350 mgs at night. When I have relapsed, I have gone up to 600 mgs for bipolar I disorder. Thankfully, I have not relapsed in a while. Sleep is a wonderful thing!",1
Been on it for over a decade. No weight gain but get the munchies at night. The xr made me feel like i had restless leg syndrome,1
"Been on it for about 2 years now. Works well for my anxiety, makes me very tired, so I take it at night and let it help me get a good night's rest. I do wake up feeling groggy, I just give myself more time in the morning than I used to to be up and ready.",1
"I took it for sleep, and it made me horribly unstable. Running into door jambs, can't walk straight unstable. Your mileage may vary.",1
"It's a great medication... here and there side effects and yes I have gained almost 40 pounds myself .... it helps with schizophrenia, anxiety , helps you sleep kinda for me, and helps with depression , etc..... I've been on it for a year I'm on 400 mg .... also I'm on other differ types of mental illness meds.... I am still struggling... best of luck to you",1
"i also want to breastfeed and i didnt know whether to go back on them or to just go without until i stop, i guess i will have to wait and see. but i am really scared hey",1
There are some meds that are considered safe while breastfeeding that I tried first (I waited until she was 9 months because I was so worried about it doing more harm than good but I couldn't handle the depression anymore).  They took the edge off but weren't super effective so once I stopped breastfeeding we went back to meds that had worked in the past.  It all works out in the end   ,1
"I stopped my meds when we started trying to get pregnant and stayed off of them until about 9 months PP due to breastfeeding; it was ROUGH, to say the least, but we all got through it.  I had/have post partum depression which has made being off meds for bipolar/PTSD/anxiety/depression MUCH worse but we are working to get back on the right meds and I'm doing a lot better.
Hang in there!  Once you have your little bundle of joy and start feeling more like yourself it will all be worth it--just take it one day at a time.  Good luck!",1
Agreed. I took a similar couple of photos awhile back. It's scary how quickly my mind can shift.,1
"Mentally I'll people are stronger than normal people can ever be. Always remember that. Sometimes other peoples issues can make you feel that you are wrong but she how you really feel when someone is finally willing to tell you the naked truth. I find it just plain cruel for the next person to lie to you while the truth sets us free. We can handle the truth better than not knowing. Not knowing desturbs us and for what its worth, I think we are who and what we are because we have the truth inside ourselves as life is supposed to by lived by yet the normal peoples in acceptance of life is far fetched from the truth that we came into being with. So don't  feel sorry for being honest, true, consistent, caring, loving, supportive and brave enough to live and love. As ""mentally I'll people"", no one deserves us unless they know how to love as we do, the right way, the only way, the real way. We are real people. The minute everyone accepts that, we can all feel free within and do what the likes of Bill Gates, Einstein, Richard Brandon and so many others hthat has contributed massively to the advancement of this world can do. So accept your delve as an already evolved being and that you are more valuable to this life than many. People fear you because they know you can do so much better. Own it, own what you gave. These qualities you have that so many aspire to become. The irony is that they seek us out to experience only yge laughter and joy that rubbs off on them in our company. No more unnessasary apologies for things another persons weakness makes you speak the truth of. I love you and you are all magnificent. Please forgive any spelling errors. I was inspired and have overcome and couldn't turn back to edit.
Love you unconditionally.",1

"I've gone from chronic depression with anxiety to bipolar, severe, mixed over 28 years. My life just seems to get harder and harder. Hospitalizations, legal interventions, partial hospitalizations, therapy, psychiatrists...I live the stereotypes and myths of mental illness every single goddamn day. And it hurts so badly. I have no one left in my life except my loving and accepting sons who keep me going and I love so dearly. They are the only positives left. Everyone else lies to me, judges, dismisses, and wants nothing to do with me. I have to fight for everything in my life and I am exhausted and do not trust anyone anymore. This is a horrible, degrading, expensive disease that literally has l ruined me and left me with little hope or happiness. I'm crying now. My life is worthless. I've never been stable, just get worse and worse. If people only could feel the hate and indifference that is so intolerable that I want to die.",1

I would do what someone else said and go to the ER-- they will help you and they may even report your physician.  Take your empty bottle of med with you to show when it was filled and therefore, also show when it ran out.  They will contact your doctor and get some answers and help you.",1
cbd will help a lot.i have panic attacks and anxiaty. cbd helps a lot.,1
"I take a couple supplements that are natural that may help. THESE ARE NOT IN PLACE OF THE MEDICATIONS YOUR PSYCHIATRIST PRESCRIBES YOU. 
These supplements can be purchased from ""Thorne Research."" They are not habit forming & you can take them with any medication you may be on. My psychiatrist & other drs are aware I take these supplements & are pleased.
At night I take 3 of the ""L-TRYPTOPHAN"" to help me sleep. I also add a few capsules of ""GABA"" as well. ""GABA"" has a calming & relaxing affect.
""L-TRYPTOPHAN"" is in Turkey & naturally aids with sleep. 
I'm prescribed Xanax. It is necessary, but I try to take it as little as possible. Since GABA calms & relaxes. I try to take GABA in place of Xanax when possible. Especially during the day. GABA will relax you, but will not make you impaired or fall asleep while driving etc. I suffer from social anxiety. GABA calms my anxiety without the side effects of benzos.  Xanax is necessary at times. Yet, the less I take....the better.
Oh, FYI. GABA is also helpful with alcohol & drug withdrawal symptoms.
I personally take the ""Pharma GABA 250."" They also make GABA 100. Most people don't need as much as I take. You'll have to see what works for you. Hope this helps. Good luck to you.",1
"I am actually glad I weaned off that medication. It had horrible side effects for me. Call your doctor and leave a voicemail if you have to! I remember once I quit taking Zoloft and things didn't go well (wouldn't recommend that particular medication). In the meantime, see if you can purchase nerve tonic. It's an over the counter homeopathic medication that helps with your nerves. It's sold at drug stores.",1

"Nobody knows who I really am
I never felt this empty before
And if I ever need someone to come along
Who's gonna comfort me, and keep me strong?

We are all rowing the boat of fate
The waves keep on coming and we can't escape
But if we ever get lost on our way
The waves would guide you through another day

Far away, I'm breathing, as if I were transparent
It would seem I was in the dark, but I was only blindfolded

I give a prayer as I wait for the new day
Shining vividly up to the edge of that sea

Nobody knows who I really am
Maybe they just don't give a damn
But if I ever need someone to come along
I know you would follow me, and keep me strong

People's hearts change and sneak away from them
The moon in its new cycle leads the boats again

And every time I see your face
The ocean heaves up to my heart
You make me wanna strain at the oars, and soon
I can see the shore

Oh, I can see the shore
When will I see the shore?

I want you to know who I really am
I never thought I'd feel this way towards you
And if you ever need someone to come along
I will follow you, and keep you strong

And still the journey continues on quiet days as well
The moon in its new cycle shines on the boats again

I give a prayer as I wait for the new day
Shining vividly up to the edge of that sea

And every time I see your face
The ocean heaves up to my heart
You make me wanna strain at the oars, and soon
I can see the shore

We are rowing the boat of fate, but the waves keep attacking us

I tried running from my crappy childhood and avoid things and people that cause me pain. You can separate yourself from those who cause you anxiety. However you should get help from a psychiatrist or even a mental health worker. I really recommend you go to Emergency Ward,1
"It must feel terrible and very overwhelming. Keep communicating how you are feeling and be kind to yourself. If you a struggling, seek professional help. Xxx",1

I am so nervous they're gonna try to make me.change everything about myself.",1
Unfortunately there are some idiot therapists. Took me years to find the right fit. You mustn't give up. If you are feeling severe anxiety please go to the emergency ward at the closest hospital. Tell that you have had suicidal thoughts and feel overwhelmed and unsafe. They will admit you even if it's overnight. Usually a psychiatric nurse or doctor will assess you and give you out patient information. Stay safe. Hugs,1
"Everything you are feeling is NORMAL for Anxiety/Depression sufferers at one time or another! Do not feel like you are alone. I am also someone that find writing it all down is easier for me to express myself. And omg that therapist was a moron. I struggle with Therapists myself. Currently I'm seeing a Life counsellor  instead. When you are feeling a bit better it may help you to help someone else...I find when I'm helping someone else I'm not fixating on myself. And I'm able to move forward. And it gives me purpose and gives me something to look forward too which is a MUST! ❤️ Good Luck for tomorrow, at the worst you'll get to get things out of your head!",1
Your feelings are definately valid. Good on you for trying again. Sometimes it takes a few therapists until you find someone you click with. It can be difficult and scary to open up but a good therapist will never judge you and they understand its not easy. Let us know how it goes. Xxx,1
"I totally agree with all of these comments and I am going to be praying too.
You are not alone; just look at how all of these people care enough to tell you that it's going to be okay. 
That dreadful feeling that you're getting is just anxiety. And anxiety is just the physical manifestation of stress. It's a survival thing that our body is supposed to tell us when we are overwhelmed so that we will know we have to deal with something. It gets better now that you know what it is.
Also, I have Mental Illnesses and mine are caused by Brain Chemical Imbalances; when I take my medication and keep my Therapy appointments, I am a completely different person and functioning in this world is a lot easier. I am actually happy and helpful sometimes.",1
Never heard of a therapist saying such crazy stuff like the one you seen. Any educated therpist should be able to understand and help. Let the new therpaist know all your feeling as its all real and a struggle. GOod luck,1
"I have seen four different therapists the third one I made the most progress with but I could tell st the end when I hit a plateau she got frustrated and gave up, but the fourth one helped because I was comfortable enough with her to be able to talk about things, while I'm not sure I will ever be 100% comfortable with anyone she helped a lot. I guess what I'm saying is you are not alone and tbat there are others that are or have been in your position. I know it's hard but give it a fair shot and don't be afraid to get right to the point and tell them that you are hesitant about being there and why it will help them to better help you.",1

"I was the same at 16/17 and I found once my mum and dad stopped over compensating for me I really had to push my self and get on with things I've now had the same job for one year and I'm doing driving , I still struggle with anxiety and my mood disorder everyday but I know when I feel crap i might not feel the same tomorrow , there are lots of anxiety treatments , light therapy , CBT, I listen to music every night on YouTube for anxiety, there are also anxiety apps on iPhone and android that are very good as it works when asleep your ears are the only thing that don't sleep at night , so it is gradual and you might not nessacerily notice any changes at first .",1
"Yes completely.  I fear so much for the time I'm not here to care for him.  My son is 17 too and his anxiety can be crippling.  It is bad enough now for him, but at least he has me to lean on and to help him, but I am so worried about the future, who will look after him when I'm not here? It almost makes life seem that much more fragile.

I think as parents we beat ourselves up all the time when we can't 'fix' our children.  We don't have all the answers even though we are constantly wracking our brains trying to do our best.

I'm also trying to decide how to address the anxiety, whether there is any effective therapy or medication to help with that as with my son and with your by the sound of it, the anxiety is stopping them from living any form of normal life.

It's heartbreaking to see them suffer, they lose out on so much, it's so unfair.  I don't think many people understand how awful it is.

I'm sure you are doing a wonderful job, it's an ongoing dialogue between supporting them and not doing too much for them, we can only do our best.

All we can do is gently encourage, but a lot of the recovery or steps forward have to be governed by them, they can't be pushed too far or too fast.

I'm sure you are doing a great job, but the conditions are so difficult to deal with there are certainly no easy answers that's what makes it all so frustrating.

I hope you have others to help you, perhaps to  allow your son lean on others too to share the load from you and for him to be able to trust others enough so he can become a little less dependent on you, because I know it can be exhausting.

Best of luck to you both xx",1

"Ethan, do you have a close friend, a relative, or a counselor that you can turn to in times of trouble?  You should likely have a personal safety plan prepared (meaning you have someone to go be with when you feel especially depressed, vulnerable, or suicidal).  You definitely need to be seeing a doctor for your bipolar disorder, if you aren't already.  It's an illness that needs to be medically treated.  You definitely can't change that by yourself.  It's like thinking that if you had cancer or diabetes, you could just change it by wanting to or thinking hard enough about it.  That's not how it works.  You probably know that bipolar disorder is usually caused by chemical imbalances in the brain.  You need medications to help with getting your brain chemistry back on a healthy midline for you.

Your depression is probably causing you to have pervasive thoughts and thought loops (just in case you don't know what that is as many people wouldn't...that's when you get the same awful, negative thoughts and memories playing over and over in your mind.  You try to get away from them, but they often are intrusive and disturbing.)  Depression is BAD about causing those.  You sound like you might also have a bit of PTSD from being bullied.  All of those things can be treated well and effectively.  You need to see a doctor.  If you are really thinking of running away or doing anything damaging to yourself, please seek out help at a hospital.  There are people who can help you and who will care for you.  

And, Ethan, I know this may be hard for you to believe right now, but you NEVER deserved to be bullied.  You didn't ask for it.  The bullies were the ones who were 100% in the wrong...and NOT you.  Please do not take to heart anything they may've said about you.  Bullies deliberately try to find something to hurt their victims with.  Quite often, they seem to know exactly where our vulnerabilities and insecurities lie and attack us there.  Here's the thing...they're in the wrong and I'm sure the things they said about you were cruel, awful, and negative.  I don't know you personally, but I do know that no one...and I mean this...NO ONE deserves to be treated like that.  Please don't let them keep bullying you even now in your mind.  Whenever those thoughts and memories come back into your mind, try to confront them.  Try to explain to yourself why those things were incorrect or why those people were wrong about you.  Rebuild your inner strength by focusing on all the GOOD that I'm sure exists in you and all the good you've done in your life.  Those bullies didn't know the real you...the one deep inside.  Only you and those closest to you really know you.  So don't let these bullies and their stupid hatefulness steal another moment of your life from you.  

Please get yourself some help for your bipolar and depression.  Those can be treated and you might find all those negative thoughts and memories eventually fade with treatment.

You have only my very best wishes for a better future.",1

Hey guys I'm the one that ask this to be posted :( nervous but I didn't know it was a real thing and they want me to take celexa but I also have a fear of taking medication so it's been on my counter for the last year :(,1

"I am 6 months pregnant with my first and most of my pregnancy I've been very depressed. No idea why, I've wanted to be a mom for a long time so sometimes I feel even worse because I beat myself up for feeling like this but I can't control it. It just got really bad about 2 months in. I literally don't feel normal, I just want to stay locked in my bedroom all day and all night and most days I do just that. I am on celexa. I was on it before I got pregnant but since I've been feeling so bad, my OB actually increased my dose a couple months ago. I feel like it's helped but I'm still not 100% feeling like myself or ""normal"". I see my doctor tomorrow and I'm hoping she can recommend something to help without increasing my dose again because I'm already nervous about being on medication while pregnant, even though my doctor has reassured me over and over again it is safe and the risks are very low. I can relate to what you're going through so you can talk to me if it might help. Today I just started crying and couldn't stop I'm just so drained from feeling like this, I want to be excited and motivated about this pregnancy and I just want to be a good mom. I think you should talk to your doctor again soon and I personally think you should try the celexa, it could. really benefit you. It does take about a full month to kick it but in the long run it could totally help you. Hope you start to feel better soon.",1
Pretty hard . I got very parinoid and and got involved in risky behavior within a month of being off meds. I halted my meds all together so I feel if it was tapered off it wouldn't have induced symptoms. I stabilized after 2 months and then went through the vicious cycle again. Try tapering off much better effect . I did well that time,1
You are beautiful and you are worth something you have to focus the need to cut on something else hun I carnt say it will get better. because every situation is different but you can manage it with help and a good support network depression runs in my family and it was unspoken about for years at it was seen as shameful but now it's better because we talk openly about it my mother my sisters myself and my son's and daughter have all self harmed and it's hard to talk about it I hope you find  some light in your darkness and hope you can get help maybe  some professional help hope it helps to know you are not alone and it can be hereditary. .. thoughts are  with you i get that when you bleed the emotions are being released that's called blood letting. You can be brutally honest with me as nothing phases me it's not disgusting it's a coping mechanism although a dangerous one we are all here for you whenever you need us,1
"I am a recovering self harmer. I see it as being like an alcoholic. You are never really over it. First of all, I strongly encourage you to seek out a crisis hotline in your area. Please, therapy can really help. For more immediate relief I used this method and it will sound weird: squeeze ice cubes. They give a burning sensation which gives you that pain feeling but doesn't have a lasting injury. And the actual physical force of squeezing them released tension and stress for me. I hope this helps. I would also draw what I wanted to cut instead of actually cutting.",1
Hugs.  I also struggle with self harm and suicidal thoughts.  I wish I knew how old you are so I could try to help.,1
"Im sorry you are feeling this way. I used to be a cutter too, until I eventally had a big break down and saw a psychologist & psychiatrist. I have managed to stop self harming and live a mostly happy & calm lifd. You can work through this. Xx
Did you know that if you text 0410 526 562 ( White Wreath ) when you are feeling depressed, suicidal, or just needing someone to talk to, a crisis counselor will text with you? Many people do not like talking on the phone and would be more comfortable texting.
It's a free service.
REMEMBER..its OK to be not OK...never be afraid to ask for help...one day you might be someone else's life line..",1
"First off, you need to report your boss.  Nobody....and I mean NOBODY.....in the authoritive position should be using words of profanity.....much less belittle any employee.  Go as high up the chain of command until you find someone who will listen and investigate it.  Record it and send it via email if you have to.  As for you're seeing a therapist......GO.  I can't stress that enough.  It's not anyone around you whose life is at jeopardy.  It's YOURS!!!!  You need professional help.  There should be some kind of hotline for crisis you can call on yourself.  If not, go to the emergency room.  Please do this for yourself.  Your life matters and you matter.  Get some help now.  I am not a cutter, but, I do understand as I know people who have cut on themselves.  The feeling of trying to escape from the pain inside only to project that pain on the outside as a means of escape.  You can message me any time you need to.  Just get that help you are desperately crying out for before it's too late.",1
"Hes saying bullshit. Not everyone has depression. He doesnt understand anything. I have depression and anxiety since basically I could talk and I know  how hard it is to fake a happy act. I get rages from my Intermittent Explosive Disorder, and cutting is the only thing that calms me down. Also I cut from guilt, costing money, and feeling such a burden. Ive been trying to stop but it's not working it's just who I am. If your friends won't accept that, I'm here for you. Drown yourself in fav music. You arent worthless to me. Stay alive for me I don't want you to die. I've been suicidal since 8 yrs old that was my first attempt, and last year I basically died. My body wasn't functioning and I was walking around out of my body. I was terrified pls stay here for me <3",1

"I've dealt with self harming too, in more ways than one. I purposely bruise myself to relief anger and hate, yet at the same time how much hurt I feel for even existing. I also deal with more suicidal thoughts more frequently and hell, I'm only 17. My mum wasn't supportive at first, she constantly yelled at me for even the smallest things and my doctor and psychiatrists say that it's just a way of attention seeking and is 'greedy' because it's causing more pain for others than myself. I, personally, feel that no one understand the amount of emotional pain the smallest things effect me. My mum only noticed how bad my mental state had gotten when I attempted suicide and kept telling her how much I wanted to die. At first, she just told me it was 'teen thing' as did the doctors. But then I was diagnosed with clinical depression, however I feel as if it's more than depression because I have traits of bipolar too. I didn't self-diagnose myself, I know others that are bipolar and they say some of my symptoms are like theirs too.

Now dear, I know it's hard and I'm sure many of us have been in your situation before but just know, you're not alone in any of this, yes people will judge but that shouldn't determine who you really are. No one knows you better than yourself. Don't let others drag you down, and I think your mother should come to some sort of understanding that you're suffering with some mental issues (sorry if that comes along rude or anything like that), but instead of yelling at you she should comfort you, reassure you and so on and not yell.

In my personal experience, after cutting my wrists and thighs I felt terrible guilt, and I wanted to stop so badly but didn't want to feel nothing because cutting myself made me feel something. I still wanted to stop, so what I did was I'd get an elastic band or hair band and keep it around my wrist, and just ping the hair band/elastic band onto my wrist or arm as hard as I could and it may leave a red mark but it won't scar or anything. Take deep breathes too, 5 seconds inhaling, 7 seconds exhaling and continue until you feel okay. Crying is also okay to do, you're human so it's okay to cry. If you feel alone, remember you're not alone. 

There are people out there who are just like you, whether you know them or not. It'll all get better eventually, I assure you sweetheart. 

I hope my words have some sort of help for you. And I'm sorry also if I made it seem all about me, I just wanted to show you that you're not alone.   ",1
"Mental illness is so misunderstood by the average person who does not have it or knows anyone close to them who is dealing with it.I hope you are talking with a psychatrist or therapist.They can put u in touch with the right kind of therapy.Sometimes you are the kind of person that can not hold down a job where other ppl are involved with your daily activities.If your mental health is taking over all your work time and home time,I would suggest you should seek out ssdi or ssi benefits.You need more counseling and therapy for yourself.You need to work on yourself right now.The stress of work is maybe to much right now.The psycharist will help explain why u cut and how to get another outlet instead of harming yourself.If your work is making you turn to doing this you need to stop going there.I know it's easier said then done.Try to work on what i said earlier in this post.The less stress for you would help alot.You cannot change how other ppl perceive you or what they think.And thats ok.You have to take care of yourself right now,You can though remove yourself from these situations where you won't be mocked or where they just don't understand it.If u are living with your mom,Go to a psycharist at the states financial help.Every state has a program for low income.{If u leave your job}.I know it will be hard but seems like you need to start with a psycharist.Doing what you are doing everyday is not getting u anywhere.Try something different by the suggestions i would take.Sorry your mother is not more supportive.Some ppl are incapable of understanding it sorry to say,Even family.Hope this helps.God Bless!",1
"I was a cutter for 12 years, have not cut now for 6 years. It is an addiction, and it actually helps to treat it as such on the road to your recovery. Start with trying 1 day without cutting and go from there. Have a reward system in place for when you succeed. There will be stumbles but keep pushing through. I suffer from cptsd and bipolar, i still get urges to self harm when im overwhelmed. But when i do, i look at my scars and just how far i have come. You CAN do it, you will move past it. And you WILL be stronger for it. All the best xx",1
"Weekly therapy proper medication can improve depression dramtically(no shame in meds,dont let anyone tell you this they've saved my life) i am recovering cutter too I've actually at my worst cut the word alone into my arm because I've felt very much like you.

Now I'm both free and happier... Its a lifelong struggle and,they'll always be bad days but it does get better with proper treatment and medication... You are loved and matter to me even though i don't know you i understand",1
I have been clean for 2 months now. And I've cut for years. I've stopped before but I couldnt keep that going. For me selfharm was a way to quiet the war inside my head and body but I also used it as punishment. Now two months ago I looked at my scars and theyre bad and thought: it has been enough. I dont know something clicked which I didnt have before. I wanted to quit for myself and no one else. But I still find it extremely difficult. Cause when I feel bad and I am tense my mind automatically goes to selfharm but what kinda helps me may be weird but I look at pictures of selfharm and while I do that the urge subsides and I also have a buddy system. i have one person who knows about it and that I want to quit and asked her to help me in a way that I can call or message her when the urge is really strong. But I find that the buddy system is a hard thing for me to do since its a huge step to ask for help. And what also helpes me is that I dont want to be to harsh on myself. I say to myself that its okay if I relapse someday. That might happen. It kinda takes the pressure away a bit. That helped me when I quit cannabis too. Just know you are not alone and you can message me if you want to!,1
"I know for myself I thought I was not worthy of people or having nice things in my life because I'm Bi Polar so I would allow abusive behavior from others.

Look for another job first then March in to that mans office and tell him to shove it up his --- !!  You are beautiful with and without scares!!   Everyone has scares but just not everyone's are seen.   Please reach out to someone and ask for help.  It does not have to be friends or family just someone.  I'm proud of you for reaching out to us.  I will pray for you!!!",1
You are not alone in this fight i also suffer from depression and anxiety. I understand the pain of no one else understanding what I'm going through but let me tell you it gets better. I know this because I almost took my life last night. If it weren't for my aunt then I wouldn't be here. I also know the joy of cutting. But truly it's a way to cope with your emotions. If you want to talk you can talk to me I'll always listen,1
"I stopped because I had children and was worried if anyone told it would be possible I might get my babies taken away. I have 3 nieces and I have seen the marks on all of them and I feel guilty like I was a bad influence on them. I have scars and it is embarrassing for me. The best advice I can give is to talk to someone you trust who won't be all judgemental on you. Someone who will let you het your emotions out so you don't feel the need to take it out on yourself. Therapy really helps too but it seems that may be an issue for you financially. Maybe look up a support group for help then. Also in therapy they teach you coping methods of things to help you keep from harming yourself. Exp: journaling, listen to music, go for a walk, do some art work or call a friend. Whatever helps you personally. Every one is different. Good luck to you ❤",1
Its okay... At least i realized im not alone in this kind of struggle..   ,1
"I currently struggle with this and have for over 20 years. I also think DBT is a great way to go as far as learning new coping skills, when you can get the help. Personally, I have found that drawing on myself with red markers or squeezing ice helps a bit. Sometimes if I have old clothes I don't wear anymore, I slash or rip them. I used to pick up henna kits because it's kind of like making scabs.

I hope you can get the therapy that will help you. There are people who understand, though I know it doesn't feel that way right now. Depression lies to us that way. Oh, and a lot of people are posting the hotline, which is great, but if you're like me and uncomfortable talking in the phone, there is a text line. 741741.

Big hugs, and thank you for speaking up and advocating for yourself!",1

"Self harm addict for over 15 years. It's tricky becuase you cant talk with others in fear of triggering them. I found rather then trying to stop how can I regulate and get to sobriety. I am at the point where I go years apart and it took a long time but anyone can get there. You've probably heard this a lot but DBT is ur best bet to learn to live with it. You have to want to own it and cope otherwise it doesn't work. My biggest helper was a mental health box. I put chocalate, photos, red washable marker, scented candle and lotion...ect....items to help you cope and ground yourslef. If you can touch ground you can usually get urslef threw next craving. Coping mechanisms are learned then you have to use them. I used think they were silly. Try this and don't work then not for you. Freeze a bunch of red koolaid ice cubes or if u got it fake blood. When i would get a craving I would push the ice hard against my skin where I hurt and it melt looking like bleeding. The ice is so cold you even get numb sensation where you push. Also can try drawing red lines then do the red ice you get more effect. Afterwards I'd clean up and put kid bandaids all over where I did it.....worked for me, can't hurt to try no pun intended",1
Please try to get help. Ik its hard cause i struggle with this as well ... trust me ik what you mean but seeking  help would be the best thing. Hugs❤️❤️❤️       an stay strong.,1
"The following things i have done to help me over the years
1. i wear a hair band or rubber band on my wrist and snap it when feeling the urge.
2. Rub an ice cube on my forearm or inner thigh when feeling the urge, it helps with the numbing 
3. I trimmed down my nails
Also i see a therapist weekly and I'm in a bipolar/depression/anxiety therapy group every sat morning 

I haven't had the urges in a few years but i have learned to recognize my triggers and how to de-escalate before it goes beyond my control. i had to set limits in my life and cut people and things out of my life (triggers)",1

"I hear the misery you are feeling. Depression is the pits & makes us think bad things about ourselves so we definately need to be able to tell someone how awful we feel. We want to be understood, what we are fighting with inside. At times a professional is our best port of call. Can you reach out to one person or service? Please do, this is tough stuff",1
"NOT everyone has depression.  Your boss is a twit.  Depression is an illness.  That's like saying that everyone has heart disease or diabetes.  He's an idiot.  

About self-harm...Quite often, self harm is caused by a need to have control in one's own life (a feeling of helplessness that combines with depression for a very nasty mix).  It's time you got some control back.

1.  This is of the utmost importance.  Get a new job.  There's absolutely NO reason to put up with verbal abuse from an employer.  He should show more professionalism.  You shouldn't have to put up with it.  I know it's scary, but you'll feel more in control of your life if you start looking for a new job.  I've worked a lot in my life and I've only ever had ONE boss who thought it was okay to cuss her employees.  First time she did it to me, I quit that moment.  Please don't put up with that crap.  It's apparent the job doesn't give you insurance, so there's no reason for you to be there when you can find something better.

Maybe your next job shouldn't be as a customer service rep?  It doesn't seem to be a good fit for you personally, especially at this point in your life.  Look into doing things you'd love instead.  

2.  FRIENDS don't just run away when things get rough.  TRUE friends will do what they can to help you.  Maybe it's time you assessed the people you have been hanging around?  You need to find new friends (real ones), but you can't do that until you get your depression under control.  

3.  Go back to church.  There has to be like the little volunteer lady or the Pastor or his wife or someone who is known for being compassionate.  Talk to them.  If nothing else, ask to talk to your pastor for spiritual counseling.  It's free and it might help you somewhat (if nothing else, you'd have someone to talk to for a bit about what you're feeling.)

4.  Check into local mental health resources that might be available for cheap or free in your area.  There may be a support group you can join.  You don't have to be alone.

Depression is an ILLNESS.  It is systemic.  It starts in the mind, but it's not long before it takes control of the entire body.  You need to have it treated like you would if you had pneumonia or diabetes or any other serious illness.  You'd go to the doctor for it.  If you must, go to an ER.  If there's a ""charity"" hospital in your town, go to their ER.  You desperately need to be treated for your depression.  You might need medications.  Depression is often caused by chemical imbalances in a person's brain.  You can't ""sleep it off.""  It doesn't work that way.  That'd be like telling the person with diabetes (a chemical imbalance dealing with the pancreas) that they can just sleep it away.  That's not how any of this works.  

If you take nothing else from my post, please remember this...

Depression is a LIAR.  It lies to you about your worth, your own abilities, your life, and the people who love you.  It tells you that no one cares.  It says that everyone hates you or that they'd be better off without you.  It whispers that you will never be good enough or that you'll never amount to anything...or your dreams for your life will never be fulfilled.  These are LIES.  It says the same type of things to every sufferer.  Those lies play like a broken record in your mind.  You need to get away from them.  Medication and therapy would do a lot for you.  If you're cutting a LOT, you may need some hospital time.  It would definitely make people in your life take you more seriously when you say that you're sick.  

Don't kill yourself or anything like that, please.  Keep reaching out.  There are people who will respond who are willing to be there for you.  The world is a big place with a lot of wonderful people in it who would help you, care for you, and be there for you.  Just keep trying.",1
I'm using mederma to get rid of the scares I only started yesterday and there is a very noticeable difference already you can try something like that I hate people seeing my scares they don't want to have nothing to do with you but it's all the time every day they don't want nothing to do with me . Keep up the fight some day someone will come into your life and support you love you hugs,1
I used to self harm when I worked in a toxic atmosphere. Ever since I got away from that terrible job I quit cutting. Maybe you should look for a better job that isn't stressful and definitely without a jerk of a boss. You deserve better than that. You are worth it. Also counseling can help and a lot of them are on a sliding pay scale so not real expensive. Get the help you need! You are worth it!,1
"First I think it's important that you realize you are not alone. You are not a burden. Your boss is ignorant because if he knew a damn thing about being mentally ill, he wouldn't of ever said any of those things. Self harm is one of those things that only YOU can change. It's important to know you already have the power inside you to stop. (Btw I have over five severe mental illnesses and no one even knows bc I hide it so well so all this is coming from experience) You are a LOT stronger than people give you credit for. You are smart and deserve to be proud of yourself for reaching out for help. Therapists are a great idea and resource for people like us. There are usually income based therapists in every location (in my state they're called north key) but you can google it. Be strong. Keep pushing. Pray. God has a plan for your pain. He will turn your pain into progress. When it rains look for rainbows. When it's dark look for stars. Don't let ANY one scare you away from God. He is not what people make Him out to be. He loves you for who you are, right where you are. Stay resilient. Things will eventually get better",1
"I also feel so anxious... And sometimes ask if God still loves me because of my self harm addiction.. But deep inside i love God.. Thanks for your advice, Madeline     ",1

"First of all if your boss is using offensive words you need to go higher. Is there a human resources department or a union rep or someone you can confide in? That should not ever be something an employee goes through whether you're dealing with your own personal issues or not. Do not believe what he said about venting. That was entirely uncalled for. If you have close friends or a family member or sibling you trust please PLEASE reach out. People will surprise you. That's one issue I struggle with, my partner surprised me when I told him I had an episode this weekend, he was genuinely worried and told me to call him next time (he's away for work). Do you draw or have any extra curriculars/artistic talents or other hobbies? What about something like ripping paper when you get the urge to cut? Have you seen a doctor or psychiatrist/counsellor? I encourage you to add that to your list, it won't ""solve"" your problems but having that unbiased person you can talk to may help you make the changes you need. Please find the emergency numbers for your area, there's several online resources, you can even do online counselling if you're worried or not up for face to face! I hope you know you are not insignificant. You're someone's child, friend, and so much more. The negative thoughts are one voice, right now they're just much louder than the positive voice. Take care and hugs!",1
"Always try to talk things through, Samaritans etc. Self harm can be a release from stresses or worries, it's like a release. Everyone will have different triggers and different ways of helping, often it's about finding something else to stop the thoughts and feelings. Exercise, walking, reading a book. Try speaking to your doctor and get some help and advice, you have been so brave to know you need help and seek it.",1
"Hi fellow friend. Please just go to hospital.i know it's scary , I've been there myself. They will help you through what you are feeling",1

You have heard correctly.  It doesn't have to be that you get irritated and stay that way it can be a number of things.  For everyone it is different.  I went from BPII to BPI.,1
Just my thoughts.Sometimes we feel so intensly or we're completely numb. When we are depressed it feels hopeless and it will never be ok. But that's not true...I'm sure you've felt similarly in the past. Just remember these feelings are temporary. In the moment it's so overwhelming especially if it goes on for  a while. I would suggest setting some goals. Even small ones    until you can start feeling hopefull again. It creates future thoughts and will help you get back on track.((Hugs)),1
Hi there. How old are you if you don't mind my asking. You are right to think of your loved ones. See a doctor please please please. I'm almost 50 years old. I have been struggling most of my life. This hurdle is hard but I promise you will get through it. Gather as much information you can so you will have the material with loved ones. I know that there are cultural differences and beliefs.

For me, music, finding meaning, purpose, and ultimately an abundance of hope was key to making what feels like to me a recovery of sorts. Or at least to be able to manage and control my mind more so than my mind controls me. 

I don't know what that is for you, but never stop being curious and wondering about the truth and all the mysteries life has to offer. It is truly boundless. 

For me, it was this realization that humanity is one and through democracy and engaging ones self in what provides you meaning, purpose, and hope that I was able to conquer my mind. 

I think it boils down to perspective and dwelling in future possibilities along with support from family, friends, therapists, doctors, and medication. 

It takes years to find the right balance of support, but I can tell you that once you make it through your hell, heaven awaits on the other side. 

I know I'm talking in vague terms, but this is how my mind works. And like any other muscle in the body, if we train it well, the mind can become our most valuable asset instead of our worst enemy. 

Although I don't know you, I have hope that you will overcome your demons and come out incredibly stronger for it. I hope that one day you come to realize this balance and are able to see and feel the positivity that many people bring to this world. You are not alone in your darkness.",1
"You need your family and friends support! I am bipolar, ptsd, ADD and when my problems first started is was sooo hard! I hit the lowest of lows and they could not find the right meds to help it was horrible it took many many drugs and a long time to get somewhat stable but my kids all know my issues and my husband is so understanding about my illness, may I ask if you see a psychiatrist and are you on meds if so which ones?",1
"Ive been there too - I think what you need now is concrete steps to help lift you up just a little and then once you are up a little you can start to help yourself out of this..  Here are some concrete steps you can take that will help you feel a little bit better within a week - please try them!!  The biggest problem with depression is we do not even try the steps people advise us to take because we dont believe they will work.  Do them anyway please!!  1) Get at least 9 hours sleep per night - if you cannot sleep by midnight, take ONE tylenol pm - this is the safest sleeping pill on the market.  If it makes you too groggy cut it in half and take half a pill.  But whatever happens you need to sleep 9 hours per night.  2) Make it a regular sleep - go to bed at the same time each night (9:30pm for example) and get up at the same time each night.  3) DONT drink caffeine or alcohol - if you love coffee get a decaf coffee substitute - there are nice tasting ones out there.  If you like to drink fruity cocktails, replace it with orange juice and lemonade mixed together (tastes just as good as cocktails) with cranberry or cherry juice added if you like..  3) Get a counsellor and book an appointment every week for an hour each week.  If you dont have health insurance use online counselling like talkspace - google it.   4) EVERY DAY go for a walk for at least one hour outside - not in a shopping mall - outside where you come into contact with nature in some way.  Even if you hate the idea of going for a walk and everything in your body is telling you not to go for that walk go anyway.  If you can, get a friend to go with you.. or family member or whatever..  5) DONT eat sugary or fatty products.  Eat foods that are as close to straight out of the ground as you can.  Even if that sounds horrible, please do it, it will really help.   6) Attend a support group - Emotions Anonymous is a great one - often local churches and mental hospitals have support groups for people with depression - find one and attend - I know its very very difficult, but you will be so glad you did!    I know these steps sound completely impossible but please try them - they will help you feel so much better.  If you are in that place where even these simple steps are just completely impossible, consider full time therapy as an outpatient to a local mental hospital",1
"Never hide your struggles. Whether you tell just one person or your whole circle is up to you. You need someone in your corner that will help you when you need and who knows what you struggle with. Me personally, I suffer from depression and anxiety and kept it to myself for years and it got really bad a few months ago but I told my two best friends and they have been able to help me when I feel it coming on. They know my struggles and they help. You need someone to help you. Seriously, even having just one person to share this burden will ease it so much for you",1
I am going through the same thing as P x but i still dont know how to come to terms with me having a mental illness i am seeing a counsler and a psychologist and on meds but still cant shake the feeling of being alone  i have a wife and kids but things with wife arent going good between us im just feeling lost,1
I know this feeling... This struggle is real and scary to at times.,1
Do you have a loved one a significant other... I just started therapy and that seems to be helping me although the last couple days been horrible for me as well just mustering the energy to get up out of bed sometimes as ugh. I do it because I have 3 kids that I love dearly and a fiance that I adore. You can trust me when I say almost everybody has thought about ending their battle once in their life. Which is very saddening because life goes so fast and there's so much amazing things in it to experience if we allow ourselves. I'm here if you want to talk,1
"One of my favorite psychologists was in a rural setting.  The rural life can do wonders for mental health.  Be proactive and seek support, but don't be afraid of this change!  It can truly be wonderful.",1
rural is a lot less scary than urban .. and waaaaay less scary than metropolitan. fresh air and sunshine do wonders for my anxiety.,1
"One of the best things I ever did was pack my bags one day, leave everyone, everything behind and moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, to become a chef. It was 6 years ago. I didn't know anyone here it took me a month to find an apartment. In culinary school no previous experience. I used to be like 335lbs. I swear I lost 100lbs the first cple months just from being a nervous wreck. But I'm still alive and kicking. I think that was the turning point for me, when I decided I was in control of my life not whatever illness. Talk to your tutors whatever you need to do to process. At some point whether it's this or an event 5 years down the road, you are going to be looking at similar roadblocks. Good luck with whatever you choose to do!",1
"I'm a second year pharmacy student and though I have my own set of severe issues, there are still certain requirements that I have to meet if I want to be a pharmacist. I chose this career knowing the requirements, and knowing my issues, and accommodations only go so far. I get extended time and private test taking for anxiety alone. I medicate well when I have rotations. To answer your question, I have told my lecturers, associate dean, provost. Basically anyone that could support me and be in my corner, but they have not given me options for special treatment in regards to rotations. Believe me, I TOTALLY feel where you are coming from. I had to run to my therapist once or twice a week to help me recover from the anxiety. Use your resources while meeting the requirements. You chose this career and you are strong enough to do it! I'm not being mean, just telling you what I've run across. We still have to be respected professionals for our patients, regardless of our own baggage. If we want our careers bad enough! Good luck!",1
Well put Jennifer. Anxiety is a bitch and she'll thrust herself into ur life like theres no tomorrow! Anxiety imo is the most harmful of disorders! Itll tell u things that just arent true and convince u they are. And on and on.....,1
I was called a nervous Nellie growing up. All I ever had were gut feelings and they were seldom wrong.,1
"Well, in all fairness, when you suffer from anxiety your gut is seldom right. But it doesn't mean the feeling isn't real.",1
Are you connected with a counselor or therapist? It is possible to do some visualization/CBT/anxiety reduction in preparation for the placement that could make it very possible.,1
I wasn't done.  My family didn't want to hear it. My life changed for the better once I got the right meds. Try to leave information around for family members can look at. Remember they love you more than you fear talkin to them. I hope I helped....hugs,1
"Hi, I suffer from depression,anxiety,i was diagnosed as bipolar 2. I've been on many different  medications and I felt like a guinea pig, but it seems now I'm on the right ones,  it's a struggle everyday. God made you special and don't forget it. If you ever need to talk reply to this message OK.",1
I also suffer from depression and anxiety from the early years of my child hood I get it I understand so you can always message me if you want to talk I'm only an inbox away,1
"I was diagnosed younger than that with depression, placed on so many different types of meds over the years. Went to a therapeutic boarding school that was abusive. So many rehabs. And other insane life events. Now I'm 32 no contact with my family. The docs tell me anti depressants are bad for me. I have raging bipolar type 1 w psychosis.. then are changing the diagnosis again now. I think doctors forget that we are all individuals and can't be treated the same way. The human Psyche is to complex to mass diagnose. Every jackass doctor has a different opinion and prescription. Currently I self medicate by microdosing marijuana. I say wtf is on my mind to anyone. I talk about my feelings/problems and if people don't like it.. kick rocks. I get where your coming from with your depression and overload of responsibilities and others n ot understanding. I was there. One day I just said fuck it and felt alot of anxiety go away. I also eat very differently now more of a vegetarian non processed food thing going. It's supposed to help also. Idk if that helps but that that's the advice I wish I got at 21. I don't talk to anyone I did back then. Not sure why I cared what people thought abt me so much for.. whoever can message me if you ever need to talk. I don't judge people..",1
"Depression is experienced in the mind, body and soul. I've found various adaptogenic herbs to help. Find counsellors or help groups. Find people you can reach out to. There are 7 billion people on this planet. http://loveinnerpeace.com/2017/08/06/reducing-stress-with-adaptogenic-herbs/",1
Sometimes not even a doctor can help being a bipolar manic depressive that I am I was prescribed 3 antidepressants all at one time they didn't seem to help so stopped taking them but as for me i maintain my illness through faith of my higher power & surround myself w/positive environment maybe being honest with urself what causes ur depression & anxiety it could very well be ur family causing the depression and anxiety u knw things like trying to live their expectations of u and feeling accepted by those that say that they love u keep in mind that i am not a doctor or a therapist but I do know this I had to cut ties w/my family in order to start living a happier life please know that I am not trying to tell u how or what to do with ur life im just telling u what worked with me I hope this will give u a little encouragement to start feeling better about urself!,1
I'm here. I'm glad to talk whenever you need someone I have anxiety and bipolar 1.,1
"If anyone is struggling, here is a list of various support numbers you can call. They have something for everyone. https://www.beyondblue.org.au/get-support/national-help-lines-and-websites",1
"Oh well, at least I don't have to be afraid she's coming home pregnant  ",1
I was on sertraline and changed to esetalopram it's worked wonders pregabaling can make your anxiety worse than help you it works well then you need more to stop the anxiety the next day it's a horrible drug maybe a suggestion but esetalopram is better n I dropped 2 drugs for it hope you feel better soon xx,1
I am on 200 sertoline 150 pregabolin and 50 quitiapene and I am still in a bad place where I struggle to do simple tasks and never go out. I hope your meds get sorted for you mate but it is hard when they keep messing with em,1
Its horrible i am isolated from outside as my panic attacks are bad dont deal well with things,1
"I take 20 mg Trintellix daily but don't have bipolar. I have PTSD, anxiety and depression.",1
I can't really tell if it's working or not to tell you the truth. I'm on 3 other meds for anxiety. I can tell those work.,1
Neurotin (Gabapinten) is not high enough to help with anxiety.,1
Completely understand I couldn't go without my meds I am always trying to get the right combination have struggled for years hoping I will get there one day,1
"Doctors do not know how any drug will affect a patient, as they affect everyone differently.  They throw drugs at you in hopes something might work.  We all need to do our own research, which is incredibly hard when one is struggling.  I have found the anti depressants to be very severely debilitating and do not take them anymore.  If you are bipolar the first med to try is lithium, at a low dose, about 300 mg. and work up every other week. Please don't just take things because a doctor tells you to.  Honestly, I have learned many of them do not have a clue and can cause huge issues in someone.  Trust your gut.  I think your doctor sounds frustrated that he has not been able to help you and is reaching at straws to try another answer.  I would try another doctor or two.",1
"I was treated for Major Depression Disorder for years mostly by my GP. After I started seeing a psychiatrist I was given a questionnaire to fill out. Then she diagnosed me bipolar based on those questions. We tried several meds over a period of time. I've been on my current program for several years. I take 600mg seroquel and 40mg viibryd. I'm also on pain meds for fibromyalgia. I take neurontin (gabapentin) 400mgs twice a day for nerve pain, ultram (tramdol) 100mgs twice a day for muscle pain, celebrex 200mgs once a day for inflammation, and I have klonopin .50 as needed (not everyday) for anxiety, and skelaxin as a muscle relaxer as needed (not everyday). It's a long list, but it's for two diagnoses and the fibro has a long list of symptoms. Since researchers haven't decisively figured out what causes the fibro you can only treat the symptoms.",1
"Celexa was horrid, horrid, horrid for me and gabapentin was useless.",1
Oh no iv to start Seriquel on the 22nd for bipolar like yourself i have been getting. treated for PTSD n anxiety disorders but like urself im now told iv got bipolar disorder can u tell me if the seroquel gives u the palpitations? Thanks x,1
"I really feel for you as I have had a similar experience... Was being treated for years for major depression, ptsd, anxiety... I was on a shit load of medication and then I moved to a new state, seeing a new psychiatrist who diagnosed bi-polar and started me on new meds but at the same time weaned me off the old ones... I actually feel much better and have not had to be admitted into hospital for over a year, which is a miracle for me... I spent 10 long years in and out of hospital having long bouts of Electric shock therapy and my body so pumped up with drugs that I literally could not move... I wasn't living, I was just existing... Seek other opinions from independent psych if you can... I truly wish you all the very best on your journey to better mental health care   ",1
Is gabapenten generic for nerotin i take that with seroquell and they both helped me alot i had to give it time to be therapeutic but after a couple months with the new doctor my anxiety went down but pills can only do so much right i am sick of pills hand full in the morning handful at night if i dont i make a happy trip to the hospital,1
My doctor switched me to brintellix once and gave me samples to take home. Then when I tried to get my rx filled my insurance wouldn't cover it because there were cheaper alternatives so I had to switch back again. Whole thing was a waste of time and horrible on my body to just switch back and forth like that. Smh,1
Everybody's system is different. I have a sensitive system so my Dr is very conservative as to any changes. I would definitely see your Dr to let them how you have reacted. Your concerns. Part of your anxiety maybe because of your recent knowledge of your diagnosis.,1
Neurontin works wonders for my anxiety though,1
Seroquel made me anxious even at low doses.,1
"secondly meds only do half the work , you need tools to deal with you anxiety, cbt is very good",1
Don't worry about the bipolar diagnosis.  Lots of depression is actually bipolar but undiagnosed.   It's easier to deal with once you know what you have and get on the right drugs.  Get off any drugs that give bad side effects asap though,1
"Because I'm suppose to be on neurontin for my nmo (which is an autoimmune disease like ms but worse). I am also bipolar, have depression & anxiety..",1
"First of all, that seroquel isn't gonna do crap at only 50mg.. I take 600-900 depending on the day. The seroquel helped me cut my xanex needs in half so I don't get anxious as easily.. I've tried everything for about a 10 year period with no success until I started a mood stabilizer.. I'm bipolar and it's all I needed",1
"My psychiatrist wants me to start seroquel and I am petrified!!!Had horrendous reaction to geodon w lomictal last fall during my 1st psych hospitalization last fall at 58 yrs old for my 1st mania lasting about 9 months including cutting which I haven't done since 14 yrs old!They took me off geodon and lomictal ,xanax,citalopram.now on clonazepam and mirtazapine but severely deppressed and don't know what to do.So scared to start more meds.Also had psychotic reaction to Prozac about 30 yrs ago.I also have cirrhosis of the liver and most meds have liver warnings but all of my psychiatrists don't seem to worry about this.Stuck in a dark room and don't know how to get out.Deppressed all my life.Survivor of severe long term childhood trauma,PTSD! Still not sure if I am bipolar!?Anyone trying CBD oils with any success?Any feedback appreciated...I can't seem to crawl out of this hole...Frozen in fear...",1
I took 50mg of Seroquel once a day and 100 mg of Trazodone. And as soon as I started the Seroquel I had bad anxiety attacks & panic attacks & even attempted to commit suicide. But everybody is different. It bothers some people and some it doesn't.,1
I took seroquel and it gave me terrible panic attacks! Everyone has their own reaction to each drug. What works for me may not work for you! Goos luck!,1
"with bipolar, if you tend to be depressed the majority of the time, it is often misdiagnosed as major depression.  I've had some doctors (for short periods of time because of their short-sidedness) that argued with me that I did not have bipolar because they hadn't witnessed any mania/hypomania in the 2 visits over 8 weeks they had been seeing me.  

The only medication you mentioned that I don't know much about is the neurontin.  The others you are on shouldn't have any adverse reactions with each other, but that doesn't mean you won't have adverse reactions to them.  The doses of the others you are on are fairly low doses.  If you have been on them for several weeks at least and are still having the panic and other side effects talk to your doctor about adjusting dosages.  If you have just started on them give it a few weeks (unless the symptoms get unbearable/life threatening) for your body to adjust to them.  It's very possible this just isn't a good combination for you.  Nothing but time and trial and error can figure out what will work.",1
"Trial and error. Diagnosed at 14 major depressive, 18bipolar and bpd also anxiety disorder and post traumatic stress disorder last year. Speak to your doctor again. Explain everything and possibly see a psychiatrist (although I'm assuming after having your diagnosis you may already be in touch with one already)?  I'm now 30 and truly trial and error. Everyone reacts differently to medications. Good luck",1
I doubt that. Been alone way to long. Seems law of averages would have come in by now. HA,1
"3 always. Panic attacks so strong I almost faint,tightness of the chest. A mix of ptsd. Large groups or new situations with large groups is overwhelming",1
"Would probably say number 3. I do find it hard to concentrate, feel tired sometimes and suffer with anxiety if I need to do something different or have to attend something that I am not comfortable with.",1
"Yes,that's me I Worry about others,but talk about mine",1
I don't take on others problems but it stresses me out more than it should when my friends are going through a hard time,1
My anxiety has been thru the roof. My spouse and I haven't been getting along,1
I'm on a constant roller coaster. I'm glad I have a boyfriend who loves me and is very understanding. He just went through the first episode with me yesterday of a bad anxiety attack. I took my meds but I needed to be outside. Of course it was raining but I had to get away. There were to many people in the house and I was feeling closed in. When I thought I was feeling better I went to set with him and I wasn't feeling better. He had everybody leave. He just held me and talked me through it. And well the rest of the night was amazing. He is the best. I love him so much. I couldn't ask for anyone better,1
"Oh dear unfortunately yes. That was the reason i started to go to counselling to try and escape the numbness, it was a horrid but worth while journey. I have slipped many times since counselling finished but i.feel i can now manage the dark days that come along. There is help out there, please access it. X",1
"If it wasn't for my beautiful daughter, I honestly don't think I could wake up everyday with how I feel lately. 

I have tried to rekindle my love for drawing, reading, writing... its just all too stressful. I am forcing myself out to events and seem to be OK, but I return home and its like I instantly forget.

These feelings you have, you are definitely not alone.",1
I know exactly where you're coming from I fight it everyday it's a struggle but I'm fighting it and I'm going to win so can you good luck,1
You can't worry about her being mad at you two she will forgive when she gets the help that she needs. You are the parents get her help!,1
Sounds like she needs to be hospitalised . Don't worry about her being mad. It's difficult being a parent. But you trying to get her help. Praying for all of you.,1
"Since you are having problems, she might be genetically inclined toward depression, but she also has to deal with living with YOUR problems. She definitely needs help with that. Maybe not a hospital.... but she DOES need some help. It's hard enough being a teenager, but being a teenager with a depressed parent? It can feel hopeless and miserable.  She might not need medications; she might just need a mentor who isn't depressed. If you can't meet her needs, it would be the kind thing to do to find someone who CAN meet her need to talk things through and find a way to continue towards maturity.",1
"She may be mad at first but she needs to be somewhere.  Someone I knew had a daughter who took a bottle of pills because  never in a million years did she expect her daughter to do herself harm, even with her depression and anxiety issues.  She could have died or been a vegtable.  Thankfully she's ok.  You don't know what your daughter is capable of.  Put her in a hospital.  And if she cries and is mad etc. Stay strong. It's for her own good.  Her life depends on it!",1
She should see a doctor as soon as possible. I've literally been where you are and now my son is dead. Don't be afraid of her being angry with you now. She will forgive you.. My prayers are with you.,1
"This is pretty judgemental. Yes, get her to a doctor asap. We all have trouble with difficult decisions especially when we are struggling ourselves.",1
Stability.....my anxiety gets me thinking stupid things I just want peace of mind and stability in my life damnit lol,1
"Thanks for the supportive comments and suggestions .. I still feel so hopeless and worthless and depressed and anxsious and insecurities and self hate and pain hurt sadness despair    and sorrow . It's not getting better . I'm tired of pretending to be strong and tired of pretending I'm ok ..I'm just fed up .. but the positivity has helped in encouraging me .. feel like giving up still .. see no point in going on.

"Relief,  I have anxiety n depression. . I worry about everything n I  get so down",1
"Money! To end the debts, bills and financial worries",1
"A constant. My life is changing so rapidly and I feel like I'm getting tossed around without anything to keep me balanced. I've lost friends and family, I'm scared of not having anyone left. I've tried different things: relationships, food, medication, religion. No matter what I hold on to, it doesn't feel like anyone wants to care. Relationships have become meaningless, food becomes poision, medication puts you on more medication to fix the problems medications cause, and religion is so often shunned or used as a weapon rather than love. I just want something to focus on and focus on me back, you know?",1
"A dog trainer, a nanny, something to predict when panic attacks are going to happen",1
"Help, but probably most of all understanding and support

I want the stupid panic attacks to stop, i want people that really care about me and not just say it so they feel better, i want a dad that isn't constantly confusing and hurting me, maybe a bf or gf that does answer my texts and is there for me when i need him and not just start a conversation and immediatly goes away after, i want a friend that doesn't try to kill me and people that stop hurting me and pushing me back because i'm coming out as  trans... my depression got better but my anxiety worse...",1
Please don't what keeps me going is the hurt I will leave behind I struggle everyday but I couldn't burden my children sending you good vibes remember everyday is a new day a new beginning hoping it helps,1
I really do want to end it all how can ppl tell me that's not how I feel that just shows how little some ppl understand my struggles .,1
I will pray for you. I don't know you but I know exactly how you feel. Took the words out of my mouth too... but I'm the kind of person that me killing my self or someone killing me is one thing but I don't wish it upon others... I'd rather it be me than someone else...

Everyone says it's going to get better but it really is going to get better. But in order for everything to be okay u have to try too. Not just sit there and be doing the same thing u do that makes u miserable. Change it up a little bit and be positive. One goal in life is to be happy but u can't do that if you're making yourself all negative.,1

"Tamara Edie-Jenkins it helps allot I also suffer social anxiety disorder. It helps with both as well as my insomnia.  Tried to cute smoking before I got the card but it didn't work to well my mood was everywhere. My therapist even recommended me to continue to smoke because it's the only thing she sees that works for me. There's 4 types I have to take. Cbd meds which has very little thc, and another which both I take orally. Those are for my bipolar depression. Then two types of oil vie the vapor pen which one is to take before bed, and the other for my anxiety. So I would definitely recommend it for someone who has tried everything but haven't found anything that helps.",1
My lithium caused bad acne for me so I just stopped taking it a month ago and I'm all over the place. Well and I was worried about the thyroid side effects,1
"I would recommend a psychiatrist as well. GP's get paid a nice stipend for each patient they prescribe certain medications, so they may be more likely to encourage one over another that's not necessarily going to be as helpful to you. Plus they have limited knowledge on a wide variety of things, so they're not going to have the experience to help. If you like to read, I would also suggest that you pick up a copy of Warrior Goddess Training: Becoming the Woman You Were Meant to Be and/or Feeling Good: the new mood therapy. I liked the activities in Feeling Good but I struggled getting through it after a while. Warrior Goddess Training I'm currently reading and really like the idea of shedding societal norms, but I do struggle to focus on some of what it says. Mind you, I'm also a newly single mom of 2 kids ages 2 and 5 so my attention span isn't the greatest!! Good luck with whatever you decide.",1
"Prayer and Bible study. Seriously. Learning that God wants THE BEST for everyone, and that He wants me to ""flee from sexual immorality""(1 Corinthians 6:18) and to ""abstain from sexual immorality. Each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not with greedy, uncontrolled sexual passion"" (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5) has, quite literally, helped me to OVERCOME this disorder. You can win this battle, too. It includes keeping busy in ""holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion"", getting your mind off your sexual urges and desires. Prayer, serious prayer, begging for help to control your passions, is vital. You can find more Bible information on this topic at wol.jw.org where you can search for published articles on Bible topics. It would be wise to seriously consider beginning the free Bible study program from Jehovah's Witnesses. You can request one on their website: jw.org",1
I'm hyper sexual when I'm manic. Keep steady boundaries and practice self care. You are vulnerable and need love not sex. This is something you can provide for yourself safely.,1
I've done a LOT of things I'm so ashamed of.    ,1
"It is SO HARD to deal with. In my 40's and still have a difficult time, it is like crack once it gets started. If you are not in a committed relationship, then have no shame, you are who you are and adults can have sex with each other. Having a committed relationship, and you stray, that is the hard part. You have to then decide if telling is only going to relieve your guilt, or telling because they deserve to know.",1
"I always end up feeling like my partner has lost interest in me because they arent as sexual. I've had an ex tell people that there was something wrong with me because of my sex drive. It's all quite upsetting. The fact that hypersexuality is a part of me is hard to grasp, even harder to know everyone doesn't think about sex as often as I do. I have learned over the years to embrace it and but I still struggle, good luck to you I hope you find some peace. You're not alone.",1
I dont have that problem. I suffer from sexual disfunction. Nothing works. Never has. Think its my epilepsy with all my meds and now with all these anxiety and bipolar meds I dont think anything will work ever. I just dont feel anything.,1
as a man that has bipolar disorder i also have hyper sexuality. my sex drive on a scale of 1 to 100 is set to 99.8 most of the time. the best way to deal if self love and self control lol. but i do understand the stress that comes from it. there is no amount of sex in the world that would fill that hole.still i try.i find it hard to ask for sex because the chance that my wife will not be in the mood and the thoughts in my head telling me she is not in love with me that im not man enugh for her that i did something wrong start and it makes things so much worse. you just have to be strong and remind your self that that its not your fault and its not in your control. pick your self up and keep moving. thats what i do to deal. each day. i hope this helps!,1
"Very hard to deal with. Makes you feel ashamed cause you come on too strong and then that gives you a reputation and so that turns you into a recluse or an outcast of sorts who still has good in your heart but instead of wasting anyone's time or being put through the ridicule of it all again and again you're left alone to face you're bi-polarizing thoughts all that time and you're sexual urges, which leads to chronic masturbation. Best thing is find a sex addict program, which isn't easy. People are really hard on those of us who have this. And while it is a part of bi-polar it can co-develop from childhood abuse too or you can be born very hypersexually active...meaning having the sensuals of it at a very young age and not really knowing why or what to do with them. They have medication if you look it up also and have doctor's to speak with.",1
It's horrible as a man. I have problems with it,1
"I screwed my wife 7 xs a nite...only cheated out of sight,  never embarrassed her, but on every trip I got laid...otherwise, I took my extreme sexuality out on my  wife",1
"Constant struggle for me... unfortunately I've become torn between having multiple partners (obviously a relationship burner) and using porn. and strip clubs and the like to enhance self-pleasure...for which I've received much ridicule.  Not a great ""answer""...more of an ""I feel your pain daily""",1
"I consider myself hypersexual... it's like I need validation, and sex is how I seek it. I know that sex and love aren't the same thing, yet if my partner isn't in the mood I feel rejected and hurt by it. It's a struggle sometimes.",1
"I have mild Anxiety and OCD, but my sex drive has never really been affected by it.  I have taken Citalopram, Sertraline and Anafranil in my life, but did not take Sertraline for long as I did not get on with it.  Made me feel sick alot and itchy with rashes.",1
"I'm glad I'm not the only one. It really triggers my anxiety, too. I'm a hot mess lol. Lots of love to you ladies ❤",1
Ill admit i slept with like 11 people in a year ... not good... now its a struggle bc my fiancée isnt too sexual so sorry no advice but i feel ya,1
"I have Bipolar I and Borderline, and every type of symptom that goes along with it.. I was a hypersexual child. But I was never promicuous, not that I will ever judge anyone that suffer with this. My husband understands the fact that I am hypersexual we have had arguments about it in the past, but he does love every part of my ""madness"" ... There are many times when he is too tired or too stressed, and those are the times I feel rejected or accuse him of cheating, which is not true.. And it does drive me insane at times, its ""normal"" ironically for someone thats hypersexual.",1
I'm so thankful that I have such an understanding family and fiance in my life. I can be very rough to deal/ live with. Even my upper manic stages are scary. I'm very blessed. Thanks for the support guys!,1
"it helped me when i was in a monogomous relationship, i could stay faithful no prob. my ex apparently (not bipolar) couldnt even though we had a very active sex life....unfortunately i dont have any good advice for being single, its been a struggle",1
"Patti Erdman I was so ocd about everything had it's place and if it was moved a 16th of an inch I went nuts the stuff had to be perfect I went so far as toothbrush and toothpicks in the cracks on the floor (tile floor). I hated it and I have shedding pets.lol. sadly after the death of my boyfriend in September I went thru such a bad depression that my whole home went to shambles and I didn't care over the winter I shut down all rooms in my house except for my living room and bathroom. The above photo is how bad my depression became and I didn't care . And that was my damned kitchen. Then we changed a couple of my meds (raised the dose) and I woke up one day toward the end of March and walked into my kitchen and was in shock, I had been so bad with the depression I had not even realized what I was doing. That photo was taken when I was about a quarter of the way done with cleaning it all up. I've never in my life lived like that before and I'd been homeless for a bit way back and was cleaner then that. It scared me to see what I was doing and not even being aware of my surroundings, and I never ever want to become that depressed ever again for any reason. Thank God I'd shut off that part of the house before I ended up dead in that garbage pile or my pets did. Ppl who don't understand how debilitating depression can become can gladly borrow my photo to show that someone is literally go out of our minds with it",1
"Me too I had a hystectomy in 2002 and a full thyroidectomy in 2008. That's a double whammy in the mood department. Throw in the depression, anxiety plus PTSD and some health issues...but then I got on Wellbutrin 300 mg and when my thyroid levels are perfect. My boyfriend loves it. Its like when we met 14 years ago lol my doc says Wellbutrin is the ""it"" med in the right dose for getting the mojo back for some folks.",1

"Donald Jose Khairullah That must be horrible D8, I am so sorry sweetie. Your brain must be hating so much on itself so much of the time. I hope you find a way to work through and find a partner who is willing to work through it with you <3",1
"Same. I'm demi with hypersexuality as well. But also, thanks to lots and lots of abuse, I have an aversion to sex on top of that. It's really fucking confusing....",1
"I so agree Susanne, I see a lot of fellow suffers reacted negatively, but for me it is a huge struggle as well especially for our spouses the ones we love most and hate to hurt, always end up hurt! My hypo-sexuality is one of my extreme highs full of excited feeling that heat of the moment passion and yearning for something that always seems to be better away from home! I get you and there's more out there like us!",1
"I thought guys would enjoy it,  but not all guys have a high sex drive.  Mine has increased even more since I've been happier and less stressed,  I've always have a high drive since I was really young,  but my past relationship was terrible so I never wanted it.  I'm obsessed with porn too,  but have been staying away so it doesn't affect my sex life.",1
"I am bipolar and suffer from anxiety and depression, i too face the struggle of hypersexuality   ",1
"He agreed to give me the amount of sex I wanted in a week. Guess what. I got moaning his dick was sore and his tummy muscles too. Booooo. Hard life right ?          yes you are right. It's hard not to think about something when you are addicted to it yet not getting your fix. Then I feel like I'm going without , and then angry and upset. And then unwanted. It's a nasty cycle",1
I'm addicted to the high after sex. So if I don't get it frequently I feel angry and upset. That gets directed at whoever I'm with. I feel unwanted and unloved without that addiction being satisfied. Having a higher sex drive than a man hits their ego. It makes them feel like they aren't satisfying me properly. I have sexual dreams where I wake up wanting it but they are tired. Lol aww. I get the ' I'm addicted to sex and porn talk ' before and then after the reality is they aren't. I duno how else to explain it. It's complicated and bloody annoying to live with,1
"I wasn't upset, just a bit confused. As I said. My apologies. Glad you have someone hanging out with you, though. :)",1
I've found several things she commented on today that had ppl upset with me and I was kinda shocked cuz I didn't know what the hell I did lol,1
It's horrible when you love someone who's sex drive is atleast 90% lower than your own. I consider it a curse I wish I didn't want it as much so I wouldn't annoy her,1
I struggle with this so much and I'm bipolar,1
Is this a huge issue with bipolar or anxiety or borderline personality does anyone know??,1
"Yes,  I have both and struggls",1
"Well I have Bipolar I , Borderline, Anxiety, Bulemia, OCD, PTSD... and one specific symptom is hypersexuality since I was a child.",1

Jeffrey Lebahn All the dinosaurs feared the t-rex,1
": We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also, a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge, and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.

"Eliminate triggers be industrious take medication if you need it.
But don't use your illness or meds as an excuse and make others responsible for your condition. 
Go to work the less time you have to think about things the less mania that can result and also people only give people the benefit of the doubt when you are well from my personal experience. 
Stand Up don't be a victim and if you need meds take them regardless of anyone!
Poor judgement whatever if you eliminate triggers you are as normal as anyone else take care!!",1
"I think a lot of times parents have a hard time accepting their child has mental health issues because they feel like it is their fault or they are being blamed or like they did something wrong. So they will try to deny or ignore things like this. Also it is hard to understand what someone else is going through unless you walk a mile in their shoes, so to speak. I have bipolar and anxiety issues etc. I had a close family member tell me that they never believed anxiety attacks were real until they had one their self. That same family member got on medication and never told me about it. I think she was embarrassed because she had secretly judged me for so long and it was too hard for her to admit that she was wrong",1

People with high blood pressure or heart problems have to take meds for life.

It's been a total shit of a nightmare without them. I have side effects and withdrawals from not taking them, my depression has taken over my entire pregnancy and life. I have 4 weeks left and counting the days until I can get back on my meds. So I'm not only asking but begging you to not stop taking your meds. Sorry so long",1
Not going out it part of being mentally Ill. I am in utah and was told cause i was not following the gospel was all my problems.

You will feel the most benifit of your meds. Maybe want to go out or just feel better inside but dont ever let anyone judge you. I was going to na but gave me anxiety had friend that went i was put on adderal and she look down on me i thought she is not In my head and blew her off,1
"I would suggest family counseling so she can understand from a professional that it's a REAL illness and not just some attention seeking behavior. Trust me if we could control it we sure as hell would. Meds can help...some don't but it takes more than getting outside. The best advice is focus on getting better and not how people;even family perceive your disorder. You can only do what you can. Each day put one foot in front of the other and take a step forward. No matter how small. Remember, you are not alone. There are many of us who suffer in silence and shame. I'm learning to become okay with being myself. ((hugs))",1
"Honestly in my experience you can educate people but you can't force them to accept that knowledge or not. Either they will try to understand or they won't. And if they won't don't stress yourself out over it because that's not your fault. You can only ask that they respect your boundaries and not discuss it because it's an upsetting or triggering topic.

"I know this feeling so well. My dad does kind of the same thing. I know a lot of it is from the generation he was raised in and the lack of mental awareness to the general population then and now. I have coworkers, friends, family who also just don't understand. It can be very hurtful at times or even down right embarrassing for me to try and explain. But I know it's not the fact that they won't understand, it's just that they can't. How can they truly understand what I'm living with when they've never had to deal with it themselves. Even other people with the same disorders can vary in functionality and how they feel about the disorder because of their own personal experiences. And sometimes we don't understand that they can't. And we just have to remember everyone is at different levels of understanding another and be able to be okay with that and know that it isn't our fault.",1

Or supporting her to stay clean, just bringing her back down after a year of soberity",1

I'm have so much depression and anxiety but i never take any meds :(,1
"I'm sure many of us as children looked at other parents and thought they were far cooler than our own, I guess it's human nature to think the grass is always greener.  

Unfortunately mental illness isn't nice for any loved ones to deal with especially for a child to understand.  Children unfortunately can be very selfish, it's not until a lot later that they learn to become selfless, some unfortunately never learn, but I'm sure that's not the case for you and your daughter, I'm sure that however hard it is for her now, she will learn to accept, understand and as she matures I'm sure she will become a far more tolerant and caring person because of it.

As others have suggested I'm sure what she really means is that she wished you were better, that you didn't have to suffer and that she didn't have to see you suffer, I'm sure she loves you very much, but it must be so hard for her to understand and comprehend why you can't get better.

We as sufferers don't often understand it because it usually doesn't make sense, so how can a child?

Children can at times be insensitive and hurtful, but it can simply be because they don't have the maturity or insight to know otherwise.  I'm sure you have come across many adults who can be far more intolerant and insensitive.

My husband didn't get it, but then again I don't think he wanted to.  Your daughter is a young girl, she has an excuse, bless her, I'm sure it's not easy for you.  I'm sure probably another day she will completely forget that flippant remark and tell you how much she loves you.

You are doing all the right things to get better, try not to dwell on this xx",1
Hey there. Accept the help of family and friends. They love you. Find out from your doctor about finding a support program for women in your situation. Be vocal about any scary thoughts that come up. The baby growing inside of you is a blessing,1
I battled with on a daily basis I don't take meds even tho I do be needed it at times but somehow I managed this monster that's inside of me yea I finds myself crying a lot and don't even know why I shake it off of me and keep a pushing ....,1
You'll struggle n it will drive you crazy some times but if you keep it it'll be the best thing u've ever had they will love you n you will love them but its up to you but stay strong n don't let anyone push you either way n as for the father if he doesn't want to help he doesn't know what his missing stay strong bub,1
"Your feelings are valid. Having a child can be overwhelming and scary even with help from the father and medication. If you decide to keep the baby there will be challenges no matter what. It can also rewarding in ways you can't imagine. Pregnancy is different for everyone, however, I cried all the time, even for happy things. I worried about everything. I thought I was incapable of being a good mom. I never asked for help either. 6 years later, I still have trouble asking for help even though my friends are more than willing. I believe you can do this :) if you want to. It's also ok to look at adoption if you don't. I personally don't think abortion is right but it is also an option if the baby isn't too far along. I'm not here to judge. No matter what you choose, you must do what is right for you and you need to take care of yourself. I did take an antidepressant during pregnancy and went to a therapist. Actually I still do both. Hiding all this only causes you to suffer more. When I started therapy and started being open with my friends and family, I found that several of them also had depression and anxiety and also needed help or emotional support as mothers. Not all of them, but a good chunk. All of a sudden I realized I had an entire support system right in front of me.",1
"If you have never officially been diagnosed with depression or anxiety, I am guessing that means you have never been given therapy or medication to help? Please, please, please, get to a doctor ASAP and tell them how you are feeling. Pregnancy hormones definitely intensify emotions and you can get much needed help from a good doctor. If the first doctor doesn't help, or doesn't take you seriously, go to another and another until you find one who does. Your life, and your child's life, are valuable.",1
"I feel for you so much can you not go to your doc or speak to a midwife I suffer too and when I was having my baby felt the same way,I managed to open up about this to my midwife and she noted everything down in my notes they kept a really good check on me right through my pregnancy once I give birth they put me on medication straight away please open up it's nothing to be ashamed about you would be surprised the amount of people and new mothers out there that feel the same way, also once my child was born and put in my arms the love you will have will surprise you it will be hard but there is a lot off support out there please open up and talk to someone God bless you x x",1
"Honestly you are not being dramatic about it, your feelings are real. you don't have to continue suffering like this, there is help for you. I know its real hard to ask for it when you are independent. I suffered for years without any help from anyone, and it got so bad I just had to say something. I was on a mood stabiliser and anti depressant before my pregnancy and they were both taken away for the first 12 weeks and then I was allowed my mood stabiliser after 12 weeks but not the anti depressant. Please see a doctor, they will prescribe something to you if the benefits of medication outweigh the cons. you really do need to be monitored to make sure you aren't going to get any worse and Im high risk post natal depression. If you talk to your family they can keep an eye on you after the baby is born. A doctor can refer you to counselling too, you may find it easier to talk about how you really feel with a stranger. I wish you all the luck xx",1
You can do this being pregnant intensifys every thing.. Emotionally ect your scared because it sounds the father of the baby is no support to you.. Find the people who care an love you an talk to them.. It's scary being a first time mother.. But your child is a blessing. An you child can change you entire world for the better keep your head up,1
"Im sure that must often be the case with mental illness, be it anxiety or depression or other illnesses, it is really good that you can take note of the signs and use them as a warning.  I think people who are in a period of recovery and have learnt how to notice signs of decline, triggers if you like and can then engage preventative measures to make sure you don't continue to spiral downwards, but this might only be possible for people who have spent years and months working thorough all of this.

I'm trying to remember all the physical symptoms I remember of severe depression, I constantly had this almost sore throat, it wasn't sore but I was always aware of this unpleasant sensation, a tightness, all to do with the anxiety of feeling depressed and not being able to escape, the nausea, tightness in my chest, unsettled stomach, lethargy, no appetite, some of these things you could almost argue were not actually physical, but psychological but felt physical...weird!

The first time I had a panic attack I honestly thought I was having a heart attack and I'm no way a drama queen or a hypochondriac! 

Yes whether it be a mental, physical, symptom, they can be so closely linked and often chicken and egg, one can lead to another and vice versa, but yes I think stress in general can cause so many physical symptoms, most very unpleasant.  That's why alone It's so important to look after yourselves, eat well, sit in the sunshine and to do some light exercise, if you can xx",1

I have anxiety depression ptsd and when I'm really down like now I get so bloody angry for no reason. So much so I'm taking out on my daughters and sister. Lucky they love me and know how I feel but I have to say it can't be easy for them not knowing what to do or say half time. Medications can work but think mine needs tweaking a little.,1
Yep..it's a daily struggle and I  can never predict where I  will be at,1
"So true on everything! It's a daily struggle just to get out of bed to decide, shower no shower. Its a freakin debate! Then I fight against it saying, I must was my hair, then blow dry it, then straighten it out...I'm tired just thinking of it! My life is so overwhelming, trust me, I strugle everyday all day!!
I'm really sorry for those of us that have to go through this all the time!!",1
"So Well Said but after soso so long I am getting tired and more tired of getting up and down all night long to the same outcome meeting me in the morningn carring me through the same pattern in the day, and then bringing on the night only to be paniced, sadened and know if tomorrow comes in my house the outcome will be the same bleek anxiety/panic as it has been no matter what has been taken, given, talked about, on and on an on",1
"I am working on my Masters in Art Therapy and I really would like to treat people without medicating them.  I dont think that should be the first go to option.   I have anxiety,  bp1 and ptsd.  Medication has never worked for me.  Art has.  Just a thought.",1
Lesson number one. Never tell employer your mental illness. They will capitalize on it . Like they did. Mocking your illness by saying it's too stressful. Trust me . Let them know your doctor gave you time off for medical reasons but that's it.,1
"I've been diagnosed with both bipolar 1 & 2, I have mixed manic episodes. I have struggled with the depression part of it for years & was relatively oblivious to being manic because it's the closest to ""normal"" I've been able to feel. I only recognize the symptoms now since I've been diagnosed & educated about this debilitating disorder. Beforehand, I just thought I was extremely depressed. I can relate to what you're going through. I remember many days of not being able to get out of bed to shower or get dressed. All I felt like doing was cry & sleep. I couldn't eat & having to interact with another human being was a living nightmare. I tried many different medications until I finally found one that made a difference. Not all medications affect people in the same way so it's important to work with a mental health physician to figure out what works best for you. I'm not gonna say medication is a fix all but it definitely does decrease symptoms & make life more bearable & worth living again. Getting enough rest is also just as equally important. Sometimes during a manic  episode sleep may seem impossible & there are medications available to help with that but personally I choose melatonin which is all natural. Above all just try your best to stay positive & on your worst days remind yourself, "" This too shall pass!"" A good support group or just one person you can trust & talk to when you're having a low also benefits greatly.  Hope this helps encourage you to keep pushing forward   ",1
"I have experienced this psychotic depression and it seems so real but you have to remember its sleep depravation.  Best thing I did was get on to you tube and look at guided meditation for insomnia, anxiety, depression, etc there are loads or sleep depravation and then go and make yourself comfy, choose Jason Stephenson or the honest guys and listen to them and do the breathing, you will find over time you will fall asleep at the beginning of the meditation and gradually catch up on your sleep but if you consider self harm then you must dial 911 or suicide prevention or the samaritans, tomorrow is another day and things can get easier.  I no longer have conversations with animated trees, they are just trees but at the time they were my very real pals,  remember it is a chemical imbalance we have often caused by burnout and exhaustion it screws up the seratonin and it takes time to recover but you can, you really can.",1
"Lack of sleep alone, afterabot 70 hours can make you psychotic.    Are you eating anything?     Drug induced sleep is an ok alternative for a while, but I recently also had a SA, and a loved one ODd on mixing the scripts with the alcohol he was so desperate.  I would like to see you go get evaluated for an inpatient stay, be safe, get rest, get on a schedule of sorts.  Mine has been off for four or five years, days without sleep, then a week in bed.  No self care.  It's a spiral.  Please, I care.  No one deserves to handle this alone, no one derves this period.  Go. Take  some positive action. Go get

"I have had a long history with major depressive disorder, multiple anxiety disorders and PTSD, I also have chronic insomnia, I understand how difficult it is to just lay there and not being able to sleep. I did try sleeping pills but they made me so spaced out to the point where I couldn't hold a conversation. I'm now on amitriptyline which has a sedative in which helps me get off to sleep the majority of the time, keep going and trust the professionals, I know that it'll be difficult to get back on track but over time you'll get there :) hope this helps :)",1
"Please, seek out a professional who knows more than wikipedia bullet points.  Too many so called PTSD experts know absolutely nothing.  My closest attempt was one year ago on the 15th of this month.  Instead I was involuntarily committed for 2 weeks.  Had they took my history of managable panic attackt that happened on occasion caused by emotional abuse growing up, constant bullying, EMS for 6 years which gives me constant flashbacks and nightmares due to a lot of horiffic stuff.  Long story short had the hospital given me a brain scan they would have found MS, and not given me a medication the month before that will make current symptoms a ton worse and how I had just realized recently? I was coming to terms with being a 6 year victim of Sociopathic abuse.  They should have realized my PTSD was Complex PTSD and I had my First MS attack because of those and other contributing factors.  My advice from experience is please get help immediately and make sure the Dr. knows more about PTSD than you do.  Please take care of yourself.  You are more important to yourself than you realize and there are people who care deeply about you.",1
"Melatonin is available over the counter at any pharmacy and helps me sleep. I also ""see things"" at times and it's terrifying. Sounds like you need some medication to help you shake off all the shitty feelings. Sending you strength.",1
"Google ""night terrors"" or ""sleep paralysis"" and you should find a pretty good explanation of the situation. It's not that uncommon, and sometimes just knowing what it is makes it easier to deal with.",1
You have anxiety so bad sweetie! Don't worry about those shadowy figures they can't hurt you only scare you that's what they want remember that. Has your doc ever prescribed you any anti anxiety meds? Just tell those shadows to beat it. You have more power than they do as a member of the living.,1
I take a antihistamine called promethazine or phenergan as it's known. I take it to sleep and was told they not addictive or can be taken to OD . Hope you manage to find help. Like Shannon said we here if you need to talk. I've been through so much and still struggle . X,1
"I also take 25mg of Phenergan at night Paula, but I am worried about weight gain...does it cause it though?",1
Excellent medication. I got really tired and drowsy in the first few weeks but wow no anxiety any more.,1
If you start lactating don't be alarmed. Risperdol does that.,1
"Risperidone has worked well for me. I have been taking it primarily for anxiety, 1 mg per day. It definitely has made a difference. I have not experienced weight gain, but I have a lot of experience with meds, so I know how to manage the hunger side-effects.",1
"Latuda had better results, but the cost is prohibitive with my insurance, and with a strong family history of heart problems the fact that it increases cholesterol worried me and my doctor. It also regulated my sleep schedule for the first time in my life.
I'm on 300mg of Lamictal right now and it doesn't seem to be going much.",1
Lamictal!!!! Latuda made me a horrible person...,1
"I had a horrible experience in every way on Latuda, but I don't know of it affects other people that badly. I DID like Lamictol.",1
I like lamictal latituda did not work for me and you dont have to worry about the food thing,1
"I'm all ears, for you I know recently I've been nothing but scared of myself I'm bipolar unmediated! IM anytime!",1
"If yur scared and have no one best plc is the hospital as yull get all the help Yu need as I took a really bad break down and had no one to speak to and I was acting crazy and didn't sleep for 12 days straight so I ended up getting sectioned and it was the best thing that could have happened am not saying am completely cured but I don't see and hear things but am still not a great sleeper so I still attend hospital and get medication, please go seek help x",1
If you feel you should go and are unsure go. It will be okay they will elvaluate you and make the appropriate decision. Have someone drive you. If you don't have a ride call a crisis number for your area or just dial 911. Please be safe and let us know you are okay. I have been where you are many times.,1
If your scare just go to get checked where i live you go threw emergency room first unless you are way out there and unable to communicate for your self,1
Currently in hospital if you think that you desperately need the help and can't cope then go to the hospital and seek help,1
"Please go see an intake coordinator for an evaluation.  They Want to help you feel safe, get rest so you can think straightet, get your meds adjusted and perhaps to a more appropriate counselor.

What exactly are you scared of?,1
Never be scared to help your mind when its failing you. I've been 4 times and it saved my life. Reach out. Get help. Don't suffer when you don't have to. Best of luck!,1
I agree if you think you might need to go than it's time. I just got out of the hospital and I can honestly say I was way more scared of what I might do than going into the hospital.,1
"You shouldn't be, just go and have it in mind that God is with you. He says we should fear not cause he's with us.",1
"If your scared and you think its time to go, then yes its time to go!",1
"If you are scared,  go.  I fight myself all the time and wish I would have gone sooner.  You will be ok there.  You will be safe.  Don't wait",1
I was on propranolo for my anxiety and worked well  was on it for a year and now been off it for couple of months . Depression wise I'm on mertazipine and quitiapine and just had a relapses over the last week so been signed of work for a few weeks but hope to get back there as soon as I can . Every person is different so it's what works best for you .,1

"Depression, anxiety disorder, PTSD.....................",1
"Dang in the U.S. they don't give disability to recently diagnosed mental illness.  You have to show a long history of it disrupting your life after diagnosed. With that being said I have generalized anxiety disorder, ibs, adhd, and depression. It takes a while to get the right combination of medication to work.  If the anxiety becomes controlled them the ibs becomes controlled with fewer ibs episodes which also can be controlled by treating the symptoms.  Working helps a lot with anxiety so don't give up on it.hope you feel better soon",1
"It takes work but you can beat it and live a normal life. My daughter is 18 and has anxiety depression and ibs and she wasn't diagnosed until she was 15 after her daddy committed suicide.  She is doing good, in college works full time. It took her time to get the right combination after meds. What I'm saying is dont give up hope or loose your dreams because you can overcome this. It is possible",1
I've had the anxiety and depression since I was 12 but they couldn't give me any medication because I was under 16.,1
"I'm on ESA I chose not to apply for pip just adds more anxiety. Propronol is helping me lots although I look more bloated put on weight but at a size 10 normally this is a good side affect, I ran out and went a few days without them I got hot flushes nausea and panic attacks so make sure once on them don't miss days.x",1
"Pip is not for mental health I get it due to my severe arthritis they ent bothered about mental health, esa I also get for severe anxiety and depression but pip won't touch you",1
"Mate honestly you need to stay busy,I've been treated for bipolar for 20 years,through the good and the bad I stayed employed,now I've got a reasonably successful career,a family, friends,but you have to work for it, nothing's free,and I've got no doubt that to much time alone with your thoughts only ends in sadness",1
"I had a job when I was 18 and decided to go to school full time. I crashed HARD after about a week of doing both. Needless to say I quit both, but found other things to occupy my time. I volunteered at my youth group then got a very part time job nannying two girls. I did that for 3 years so no shame doin what you gotta do",1
I too have depression PTSD severe anxiety.. I too can not work... I tried for many years in many types of jobs and the end result always the same.. severe breakdown.. everyone handles thiers differently and it saddens me to see that a group i look forward to reading everyday has members that devalue what someone is going thru... Emma.. Im so sorry you are experiancing this at such a young age. Do not take any stake in people trying to lessen how you feel or what you go thru daily. You are a survivor! You go girl. survive.. do your thing...safe and happy travels...,1

Its all abt gettin out there n doin it bc u have to n not living off the govt. They wont give u disability for a mental illness. Not unless ur brain dead or are mentally handicapped. Thats jst how disability works. If u can walk, talk then u can wrk. The govt doesnt see mental illnesses as a disability.",1
I work nights cus I can't deal with social situations I have bipolar anxiety complex ptsd and depression and the only thing that keeps me same and gives me a purpose is going to work,1
I have no answer for you but I would like to say that anyone who try's to devalue you and what you are going through are irrelevant. Ignore them. Do not let them make you feel bad. I know how hard it can get. I have my own struggles and it is so hard to work full time while suffering. If you need to do this and your are seeking help them good for you. Do what you need to do to take care of yourself and please do not let anyone who tries to devalue your experience succeed. It just show their lack of empathy and character. My heart goes out to you and I wish you the best. You are worth healing. You are worth loving and you are valid.,1
I took buspar and propanol they did nothing for my bad anxiety       ,1
"I think it's a worry that if you start on it now you may never be off of it. Most mean well but you also need to remember different age groups and countries hold different values and are expressed as such. 
I will say finding work that you enjoy in a business you are comfortable in as well as a company that is understanding helps alot with the anxiety at work. If you know people will understand and be caring and considerate does help. I also know that's very hard to find.",1
I'm so upset that they believe that I should just go to work because I'm an adult and I'm 18. Amy Ricker,1
Youre welcome! Its a hard life to live with those illnesses and as someone who has depression and anxiety as well I know the hard fight it can be. If you were 21 and your state was one of the ones that does medical marijuana Id suggest that. It has made a positive change for the better in my life and with so many low THC options it doesnt feel like your high as a kite.,1
"Good luck with PIP, I've got severe anxiety, depression and epilepsy and got rejected   ",1
"Emma-Jane Naude I think I will try again with the doctors help as you are.  I feel so stupid asking them, I feel anxious about the doctor laughing in my face and telling me I wouldn't deserve it or something.  I've worked all my life and want to continue working but have been signed off sick for 6 months now, and my job is hanging in the balance, the safety net of PIP would take such a big weight off my shoulders.",1
"My daughter is on propranol she is at university she has been complaining off chest pain and numbness and irregular heartbeat I worry in case it's not the tablets as she was a premature baby she won't go to the doctors it was hard enough getting her to go about her low mood and anxiety,and to be honest it really has not helped her ,I hope you feel better soon big hugs x x x",1
"Citalopram and its' sister tablet Escitalopram are not as severe as most of the other SSRIs out there, in particular Sertraline (Lustral), Seroxat (Paroxetine / Paxil) and Anafranil.  Citalopram takes the edge off the issue and the anxiety / panic, but it still allows you to function normally.

Sertraline and Seroxat can also cause libido problems in men and women.",1
"Propranolol is fab - it saved my life. simple. it just 'stops' my blood pressure rising which prevents my anxiety from getting out of control .. it just .. stops. it's like flicking a switch .. bliss. I take one every morning and it gets rid of .. conservatively speaking - at least half my anxiety symptoms. On a 'normal' day i experience almost no noticeable symptoms whatsoever. Of course some days are more stressful than others, and some situations are more stressful than others - so if i know i am going somewhere that i'm not going to like very much then a very low dose of diazepam takes care of most of the other symptoms. I can work. I can play. I can have a life. I teach . i can stand up in front of a class .. when i was at my worst i could barely leave the house. Propranolol brought me back. I'm a fan.[caveat: my anxiety is related to the BP2 and combat-related PTSD so advice may vary according to circumstances.  However, the propranolol helps nicely with the hypomania from the BP2  *and* the hyper-vigilance of the PTSD].",1
"I got rejected and wish I had never applied I became very anxious during the application and assessment period.
One of the reasons I given was that I.had a good understanding of my illness, I have BPD. No shit Sherlock ive had to live with this for 12 years of course I have researched and read about my illness",1
Irritable bowel syndrome,1
"I have depression, severe anxiety, and PTSD. Been diagnosed with all three for well over a decade and I still get up every morning Mon-Fri to go to work. 
Why?? 
Because that's what adults do. 
You ought to try to find a job that fits you, rather than decide at 18 that you'll spend the rest of your life of disability.  I'm not trying to be mean when I say this, but damn...  Don't let the disease define you!!",1
I think that's a hiif idea. The way the other comment was said didn't sound like a nice suggestion. People can only do so much without being overwhelmed. Easing into things is the better way. If a person can.,1
"I have suggested to somebody I know who has OCD, Anxiety and Depression to try volunteering in a shop for either MIND, BHF, PDSA, the Red Cross, etc, just for the social element and for the experience of work in the hope that one day, maybe, they could use whichever skills they have gained in volunteering and apply for a paid job, be it part-time or otherwise.  This would give them something to look forward to and hopefully help them build up their self-esteem in the long run.

Having a volunteer job to begin with is a good start and it would not affect the benefit claims.  I tried to explain all this to the person's mother, but she did not approve.  I really don't know why when it would serve as a constructive purpose and none of the benefits would be harmed.  In fact, the DWP / Employment Centre / Local Council would applaud the effort in trying to do something positive.",1
"I was going to try for disability until my lawyer said it was a 17 month waiting period, and an additional 6 months just to get a decision. That's over 2 years of waiting. Um no thank you. I would rather work than be broke and loose every thing. Work is difficult with BP and anxiety I understand that, but it's not impossible. It's just finding a job that you can do that fits you.",1
"Like many have already said, everyones circumstances are different and we should not judge. It is difficult to work if you are constantly having panic attacks, can't focus on tasks or on what your boss is saying, freezing up when people speak to you, etc. Disability may or may not be a permanent thing but age is not always an indicator of how ""ready"" or capable someone is of working. Also with age can come an understanding and growth of coping mechanisms and medication adjustments that could lead to being able to work someday but she needs money in the meantime, yeah? Just saying, just because she's young doesn't mean she is more capable of overcoming her disability, and in this case it may actually work against her. I do agree she should not give up hope of working someday, but acting like she is immature because she struggles with debilitating mental illness is very condescending and shows a lack of empathy and understanding that not everyone is like you. And just because you have/had it bad doesn't mean there isn't someone who has it worse.",1
"I used to work full time, but I had to change to part time because I was so mentally exhausted and was having panic attacks as soon as I clocked out. I took 2 weeks off of work to rest. You know what's best for you. Like you said everyone is different. Maybe you could try volunteer work when you start to feel better",1
"I also work nights because I can't work with the public nor a lot of co workers and though I still have lots of anxiety and feel at times I wanna pass out or hide, I try to collect myself and keep going! I have had my illnesses since I was 12 also and I am now 45 so we walk in different shoes but have some similar experiences!",1
"I've been diagnosed with literally the same exact things plus panic disorder and was on disability since I was 16. But I lost my disability at age 21 and went almost 4 years without it or even a job because I believed the same thing. When you have severe social anxiety and panic attacks randomly you already know there's no way I'd want to be around hella people and feel so miserable. But on the inside I'm also passionate about living life and having awesome fun precious moments with friends and family and I want what my friends have; a life. A life where you're exhausted, but because of work not my disability. I want to feel stress. The kind about college not how I'm going to survive mentally and physically  today or how I'm going to ask mom for money to pay my phone bill. I'm missing out and I'll be 25 on September 2nd. I'm a strong person I just haven't tried hard enough, which hurts kinda of to say because I believe I do try. I try every damn day to wake up and be ok but most of the time my demons stop me and get the best of me. But the last 5 months, something clicked. In April I lost my medical insurance, and I've been going all this time without my pills. I was on trazadone, lamotrigine, propranolol etc... but I've been staying with my bfs mom and she's been such great help and I realized with a change of environment (for me, in my own case not suggesting this works for everyone) I've changed completely. A friend is helping me get a part time job and I couldn't be happier or more proud of myself for facing my fears. The point of this long comment is that, I wish I did what I'm trying to do now when I was your age because I'm getting older and now it's gonna take me longer to be who I want to be. Don't make my mistake. I've seen people with worst cases of paranoia schizophrenia and be amazing successful people speaking in front of crowds and hallucinating at the same time but pushing it to the side to be able to do their job and you'd never guess. You can work with ptsd, anxiety, etc. Is it going to be easy? No. Are you gonna  mess up, have an episode maybe even lose your job? Yeah tbh, but you get up, take care of yourself first, and try again. I hope you see this as helpful and not judging or a negative comment because I promise it's not. Sorry for long comment lol Emma-Jane Naude",1
"I'm on Permanent Disability now after almost 30 years of driving myself into the ground. However I have very severe Bipolar, BPD, Major Anixety and Panic Disorder, PTSD,. Not saying you shouldn't apply for it, but here in Canada generally for just anxiety and ptsd they wouldn't quailfy you for permanent disability just PPWD which is given for 2 years to help get your self ready for the world. Due to the severe trauma I suffered growing up and everything that happened and numerous suicide attempts, and fighting for help I got a new doc who immediately saw how much I was suffering and got me on disability. I also have a now 8 year old son whom I help raise with my inlaws due to the severity of my illnesses.. I would suggest starting with therapy, maybe doing a job few days a week, and finding other ways to help you. Not saying you don't quailfy for aid. But your still very young and you may have a hard time being accepted for such funding. However like the one lady said every one is different. I wish you the best",1
"Bonnie Corbin, what you said to her is absolutely horrible. No two people have the history or personal level of any mental disorder. And too suggest otherwise only shows that you truly know nothing or truly dont understand mental illness. To say what you insinuated on this page is horrible.",1

"I've been working as a therapist for 10 years. There's only 11 disorders I regularly treat. Yet no 2 clients are ever the same. 
There are massively differing severities of the same condition, ranging from functional when the person can work well, to the other extreme where hospitalisation is needed.  
There are times when I tell a client to keep working, because the routine is good for their depression, or the anxiety is manageable with support and avoidance would worsen the anxiety. However there are also times when I would encourage someone to remove stresses like work from their lives so they can focus on getting good at managing the basics. 
Lots of people have the same diagnosis, but treatment and advice will vary for the individual. 
Pip application is difficult, if you are able to get an advocate or advice from CAB it may assist you in navigating the process.

"Izzie Radford-Nash -
Saying everyone here has mental illness so we understand your situation is COMPLETELY untrue and destructive to say, my PTSD, anxiety, depression, etc experience is not identical to Emma-Jane's or anyone else's nor are theirs identitcal to each other... so yes you have SOME glimmer of insight into others lives with the same condition but just because you fight similar demons doesnt mean you understand theirs...",1
I have severe depression and anxiety and just turned 19. I have a job and do so agree with bonnie,1
"Emma-Jane  I have dealt with aniexty and depression for years. I got married and then had a baby at 19. That's when the depression hit hardest. When my son was about 2, I got pregnant again. Still felt the same way. When my middle was about 3, I took floral classes just to get out of the house. Best decision I ever made. Working with flowers for me, is calming. 3 years ago, my teacher hired me to work at her flower shop. I look forward to going to work because it's a stress reliever. Maybe doing something that sounds fun to do or taking an art class in an adult school will help. I'm 34 now and I still have aniexty and depression but it's getting better. Just find something that looks like fun. It could be hiking, arts and crafts etc. Good luck!",1
"I in now way, shape, or form devalued her situation or judged her experience. I told her that there are ways of living with anxiety and not to give up. You don't have to be a victim. 
I think it's absolutely absurd that doctors are so quick to tell a young woman, who has just admitted she's never even been to therapy, that she should just give up on working and go on disability because she has anxiety.  
Am I the only one who sees the ridiculousness in this?!?
Her anxiety will only increase if she gives in to it, and deciding not to work before even going through therapy is just ludicrous to me.",1
"I found working helped me. I had to cope through anxiety attacks in a ""safe"" environment. Gaining more confidence and success in dealing with the disorder helps you to manage it better long term. I've taken two tours of Europe, been to Mexico, and many other trips doing things I never thought I would do. Anxiety is uncomfortable, but it isn't dangerous, is what I tell myself.

"I've had this since I was 12 both the anxiety and depression, this hasn't been an easy decision for me. I don't want to give up but even if I go on PIP for a few years until I'm mentally stable and ready for work then I will but for now it's what I believe is best. I am waiting to get an appointment for a counsellor but not heard anything back.",1
"You have so much life to live, there are so many different treatments and things you could be doing to help cope with the anxiety. 
I'm honestly appalled the doctor would suggest it ... have you seen a psychiatrist?",1
"I'm SO sorry to hear that, and I wish that I could give you some hope... I have a congenital heart defect which was only 'found' when I was 19 years old (told I was just a lazy, unsociable child). Had some side effects with that (low blood pressure, blackouts, depression), but had 1st pacemaker after the birth of my eldest child. Now (LOTS of years later), Jan-April 2016 had 4 pacemaker ops due to 'complications'; have been treated for depression, anxiety, sociophobia & insomnia since my husband's death 6 years ago and had to give up a lifetime job which I loved.  PIP was stopped in February, causing many problems. CAB has been extraordinarily helpful in appealing AND re-appealing, but say even if it's good news, I'll  hear nothing until October. I feel guilty, still, knowing that this is being done to people who are dying, and I'm lucky, but it sucks. Good luck to you, and PLEASE get a support worker or go to Citizens' Advice Bureau!

I stopped taking propanolol because I didn't feel that much of a difference when on it. I still had anxiety attacks and it wasn't helping much for working. It may work for you though. Everyone reacts differently to different medications. All it did for me was slow my heart rate down a bit.,1
"Me too, it stopped the shakes and heart racing at first but I found it didn't work as well later on. It doesn't do anything for the brain whir. I've been told now to just take it as needed",1
I find the propananolol helps with the heart palps I have with my anxiety,1
Propanolol is a BP med often used for anxiety by helping to keep your BP low. Usually you need more of a DX to qualify for any assistance.  ,1
My neurologist wouldn't prescribe Propranolol to me as a migraine preventative because it can cause a low mood/depression. I have Major Depressive Disorder and anxiety.,1
I had this for my anxiety. Got taken off it due to pregnancy. Gone from fairly functioning human being to not being able to leave the house most days  . I have agoraphobia without it. Panic attacks at the thought of being around people. I can't sleep properly without it as my anxiety keeps me awake. Pregabalin honestly changed my life,1
It caused me all sorts of problems.. I had drug induced narcolepsy and dementia! It really really didn't agree with me. I sat in a meeting for a hour and panicked 2 days later thinking I'd missed it! My partner was with me as said I fell asleep 4 times and kept forgetting what I was talking about!! Then I scored 0 on my PIP what a joke!!!!!,1
I have propanolol for anxiety,1
I would recommend it for anxiety i cant manage without it,1
"Pregabalin is a very hit and miss drug and I consider it still largly experimental in all fields because there havent been many tests done on it (compared to most drugs) it was designed for neuropathic pain, it works somewhat for most anxiety not completely and is addictive despite ""expert opinion"" I had to ween off it because I got addicted with side effects like euphoria and weight gain... 

To answer the questiom though, yes, you will likely gain a lot of weight, most people do, because it slows nerve transmission eventually slowing metabolism",1

I'm hoping your doctor is helping you and you can visit again if you need to.

Has he prescribed any medication to help?

If you are in the US I don't know the rules on employment, it doesn't seem right that she is pressurising you to leave.  Only you can decide on what to do, whether the job is right for you.

With mental illness we can blame ourselves and feel guilty, it's really not your fault, you didn't choose to be like this.  Yes emotions can be all over the place, it certainly can be dreadful sometimes.

I hope you have people to help and support you, lean on them xx",1
Yeah you kinda put yourself in a corner saying you want a job that is not so stressful. I would start looking for one that is not as stressful and you will feel so much reilf. I had a bad job i would cry before and cry after i am disabled and had a special paper filled out they couldnt fire me but i got a lot of shit and when the project closed and i didnt have the job i was amazed how great it was not having stress now i have a job that is so mellow i love it. I wish you well and hope you find whats best for you.,1
I know. It's horrible isn't it. But we are stronger than people think. We get up and do it where some wouldn't when they dint even have our problem. Remember we are strong and better than everyone else!!   . X,1
Thank you Susan. I have to be back on Monday and already stressing,1
Don't ever feel guilty. A job is a job. Your health is more important. Sounds to me she is not as supportive as she said she would be. Maybe some time off won't hurt. A new job a new start may help. I feel you. I feel trapped. I feel too scared to try and move on so I continue to go to work unhappy. I wish i could do what I'm advising you to do.,1
I'm the same. But frightened to change and worried that everything might go wrong. I don't do change very well. I'm a creatures of habit and change scares me. Maybe part of my anxiety. We have so many barriers to try and cross because of our illness. But we should give ourselves a pat on the back because we actually get up and go to work. It's such a hard thing to do for us but we do it. I've tried looking for other work but when I see the application form my mind goes blank and I have no idea what they are wanting me to say. I talk myself out of it then and think I'm not good enough for anything else. Hopefully one day day we have the strength to make the change. Good luck    x,1
It is genetic in our family my sister got it if you could make it past the age of 29 and not get it then you would not. I was worried till 30 i have a list of other problems. I just didnt want that one to. Hopefully there will be betterb medication if the gen pops up in my great grand childrens lives,1
"I'm wondering what are their reasons for not believing u... that's gotta be really hurtful and hard to deal with. You should be very proud of yourself for having made it this far without their support, you are very strong for that. As for advice, Candace couldn't have said it any better. But I have a feeling something will happen to open their eyes. When you are patient and focus on bettering yourself instead of stressing and fighting, everything else usually tends to fall in to place. Good luck, I hope it works out for u",1
You have to let it go... none of us are perfect and dealing with bipolar or any mental issue is such a struggle. People that don't have the daily struggle have no idea how hard it can be for us. I'm happy that you have finally found medications to help because sometimes I could take a lifetime but when you find that moment or you feel like yourself it's precious don't ever let anybody else diminish your Shining Light,1
I'm going through something similar n just reading through the comments has made me feel a little less guilty abt cutting people off. Being part of this group has saved me many times. Thanku   ,1
Yes people dont understand my family has a problem of everytime i get mad or upset its cause im mentally ill. I hate it but I have to step back and keep telling myself they just dont like to be accountable for thier actions and i know its not me cause i can tell the difference when im manic and just pissed.,1
"If you have tried every way you can think of to inform this person of what your condition is about (I find the memes and such can be an easy and helpful way to explain things sometimes) and they just refuse to understand or believe you then to me they would be toxic and I would remove them from my life.  If down the road they have educated themselves and want to be a positive impact on my life I would start out slowly rebuilding that relationship.  I have lost a lot of ""friends"" and most of my family because they don't believe what bipolar disorder/depression and anxiety are.  It is my opinion that those who truly love and care for you, will make the effort to learn about the condition, how to treat you and support you with your condition just as they would with anybody that has an invisible condition like heart disease, lung disease etc.  Having a ""broken brain"" as I call it is serious and you don't need toxic people in your life.  Life is too short and being stable is a hard place to get to.  You want to enjoy being stable and having a life again.  You can't do that with toxic people in your life.  Just my opinion.",1
"As long as you are feeling more stable on your meds try not to worry about what other people say or think, your are more important. It is hard enough coping without their negative input. Stay strong and keep looking forward   ",1

"Someone who's never been there will never empathize, let alone be compassionate about your case (unless they have the kind of golden heart that allows them to -somewhat- sympathize with you).
It might be hard at first, but you should distance yourself from anything or anyone that makes you feel angry, sad or guilty. These 3 emotions at higher degrees are the gateway to depression. You need to find people that have been there and overcame it, or learned to cope.
Interacting with others, even online in a FB group, is a good start I'd say. :)

"I have a couple of easy suggestions that I was able to do that helped tremendously in regards to your GED.
Try to find a free, short class to help you pass your GED; they have them all over. Probably even online these days. 
Or, go to your local Public Library and study they're book for GED's. I think you might have to do it there but not sure. And take the GET practice tests to see if there is anything on each one that you need to study or learn. Then take the practice tests again before you go to take each GED test, that way you get rid of any doubt or anxiety and save yourself some time. 
Then, go for it. It looks to me like you can do this so good luck with the New Job when you get one.",1

Now the first time, another psychiatrist that should not be practicing, took me off 400mg in two weeks and I went into a mixed episode, one of the worst experiences I've gone through. I was on medical leave for three months. The other two times it was a gradual decrease and I did not experience mania or mixed. This is just my experience though.",1

I use a Mon thru Sun pill holder for my am meds and I have an alarm set everyday for 5pm to remind me to take my evening meds,1
Alarms on phone!!!,1
"I take mine as soon as I wake up. I have anxiety and depression. So I find if I don't, then I'm setting myself up for a bad day of anxiety attacks, finding excuses not to go out, over thinking every little detail about everything and just sit all day in my pjs feeling sorry for muself.... I find if I take it straight away with my cup of tea first thing. Then I am ok for the day, most times I can get on with only minor blips.",1
"I do a pill organizer and set alarms on my phone. Plus, for my as needed meds, i have a chart that i use.",1
I set alarms on my phone and I use my pill box,1
This may be a stupid answer but how can you not remember I take mine 3 times a day morning as soon as I get up 2 pm and 10 pm my body tells me when too if I'm late will start acting crazy and severe panic attacks hope this helps,1
Thank you Dre Wag and Amanda Austin for the kind words we are all dealing with this horrible disease we should band together not tear each other apart it's hard enough coping with life and people who have no clue what we go through daily IM SORRY IF I HURT ANYONE'S FEELINGS I DIDN'T MEAN TOO,1
"Becca Mckain I wasn't upset by your question, once upon a time I would of asked the same thing but now I do forget. Sometimes my body reminds me but sometimes I can last all day. Sorry you feel you can't ask your question.",1
I forget all the damn time. I'm horrible at taking meds,1
"GUESS I SHOULD JUST KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT ON GIVING MY OPINION ON THIS. WE ARE ALL GROWN UPS ON HERE THANKS FOR THE ASS CHEWING AND BY THE WAY I HAVE CLINICAL DEPRESSION, CHRONIC ANXIETY,  C - PTSD AND BI POLAR THIS IS A OPEN FORUM FOR PEOPLE TO TALK I'LL NEVER SAY A DAMN THING AGAIN HOPE EVERYBODY HAS A WONDERFUL LIFE",1
"I always sucked at birth control too! I ended up getting the needle for a few years, I'm scared of the IUD! ~Dani",1
I remember my PRN pain and anxiety meds though! Imagine that! Just not my routines... ~Dani,1
"Same with me, Jennifer Davis! Any change in my regular routine causes me to forget my pills. I also don't wake up at the same time everyday.. and also same as you with medications for other problems... some meds I have to take on an empty stomach, some with food, some pills I have to take 2 and 4 hours after or before a different pill. It can get very confusing very quickly! ~Dani",1
I just simply use an alarm on my phone and keep a small travel daily pill box with me,1
"I have various alarms set up on my phone and they are in a box next to my bed, that I set up weekly xx",1
"I don't . is the easy answer. However, as a BP2 then it is rarely life-threatening if i miss a dose .. unless I am in a depressive episode of course , in which case it's a little too late to worry about that since i am barely able to feed myself never mind remember my meds.",1
My daughter has an alarm in her phone. I just have mine in my bedside table and it is the first thing I do when I wake up.,1
Set an alarm.⏰,1
"I use alarms om my phone. 1 for morning, 1 for evening. As I take two seperate med and doseage, I deferrientiate on the alarm note.",1
Set your alarm,1
My boyfriend set an alarm on his phone to remind me. It helps,1
Elizabeth Hartman Sophia Elizabeth Monk I'm guilty of that too :-(,1
"Ive used apps and alarms before. I just click the ""I took my meds"" button and move on without actually taking them",1
I always remember to take mine on time but they sell pill boxes with alarms on them..they also sell pill container covers with an alarm . Ive seen those at rite aid..the pill box u can get on amazon.,1
Pill planner next to my bed for morning and night and alarm on my phone for evening doses,1
How can I  avoid over thinking.?,1
I allways over think n analyze everything too death im on six different medications n none of them help this problem for me personally I shut my mind off by smoking weed it helps with my mind n anxiety,1
"Breathe in for 5 seconds, hold for 3, exhale for 4.  That's the way I do it but that only helps calm anxiety and doesn't really help my thinking.  Personally I drink a lot of whiskey and pop an opiate but I don't recommend that for anyone.",1
I set an alarm on my phone,1
"Damn, I wish that nobody had mental or emotional illnesses! I understand you guys! It's so difficult to deal with Bipolar Disorder and with Depression on a day to day basis! I just wish that nobody would suffer from that! It's just horrible!",1
This is so true ... we have no choice but to be strong ... we have to fight to do the simplest things ... we battle so much unimaginable pain ... and hurt sadness and despair and sorrow.. it's a stuggle just to deal with everything .. it's not for pussies that's for Shure .. I've been struggling for years .. bout ready to give up .. rather die then keep going,1
"I lost weight on abilify. I gained 150lbs on geodon, zyprexa, and Seroquel over a 3 year period. ( taking these meds at different times) My abilify dose goes from.10 to 20 mg depending on time of year and other factors. I have been on abilify now for 7 years. I am much more functional now. Side effect wise I tend to get nauseous very easily, as well as an upset stomach, and intestinal issues, which my pdoc said may be the abilify.",1
"Abilify did absolutely nothing butbmake me worse. I had no energy on it, the hallucinations and paranoia got worse andso did the depression. Plus it caused me to have chest pains that were directly related to the medication being combined with another med.  I was only on it for 4 weeks, but that was a miserable 4 weeks.",1
I don't know. Some of my friends hallucinate and get paranoid and have done very well on it. I just know it wasn't the med for me.,1
Ohh ok. Maybe it just isn't good for people that have that and paranoia,1
I'm on 15mg of abilify I have higher blood pressure and increased sweating and have gained half a stone in 3 months but it's the best one I've had at stabilising me x,1
"Was on it for years, gained over 50 lbs, blood pressure increased, needed more meds for that. When blood sugar increased had to be taken off before I became diabetic.",1
"you will probably find mixed results. My doc just put me on Abilify because I couldn't get out of bed. My energy level was 0. Now, I have only been on it less than a week but I can get out of bed now. Still low on energy but I am feeling it go up. My doctor also knows I am worried about weight gain as I am 100 lbs over weight and have 5 blown out discs in my back. I can't gain anymore or I will be at a loss.  She said for adult, the older you are the more energy it will hopefully give you and shouldn't gain any weight. The younger you are it will be just the opposite.",1
My best mate is on abilify and he seems to be ok in the energy department; I mean he was probably tired for a while when they started him on it but currently he doesn't seem to have any energy issues related to medication (his schizophrenia and anxiety causes tiredness but his levels of tiredness are the same as prior to abilify).,1
I think ive said this a thousand times before unless you have a diagnosis of mental illness or a doctor you'll never understand the way the person feels somewhere along the line my heart has hardened although my family is supportive there are many who have left me for dead in their lives including my biological father nobody asks for this dont be ashamed of your tears you have every right to express your pain be blunt tell them exactly what they are doing n how it makes you feel if it continues you need to seek support somewhere else family should allways be there for you that being said respect yourself enough to get the support you deserve for the record I am bipolar 2 border line personality disorder and schizoaffective,1

"To have to struggle with myself so much, you have to have a spine, or grow nuts, it's a survival mechanism! It's always one thing or another. Brave I have to be",1
"Sleep deprivation and to much sleep are common, you have to just roll with it ! Just understand ur not lazy and expect  and accept that , don't beat yourself up, ur already struggling. They say you have to force yourself up, I really have tried that and having a sun lamp helps, take vitaminD. For u may be insufficient. Sounds like ur not going thru the R.E.M. phase of sleep, rapid eye movement u think you've slept for eight hrs. But when you wake you don't feel like you've slept at all",1
"Hell, my meds change constantly. If you do not understand why or how much of a medication you can call your provider and speak with their nurse or talk to your pharmacist. My pharmacy gives me an information printout on each med I take every time it is filled or refilled. I have bipolar, severe, mixed. You are not alone. I get paranoia and tend to be catastrophic, and  have many trust issues. You must become your own advocate. Accept help when you can, ask if you wonder, take care of yourself is #1. I have boys I raised when diagnosed. It was difficult, but more freeing, as children are more forgiving. They do not need long or inappropriate information. Continued my love for them, explained when ""Mommy"" was not feeling well. Now they are young men who understand my disease and freely love me. Do not overburden your children with language they would not understand. Please, take care and love yourself and love and respect your children.",1

Im having the same problem with lamictal made me feel sick light headed and dizzy and nausea  and rash i stopped taking it i also take a low dose of seraqual it seems to be making me ill too and making it hard to want to anything its hard getting out of bed and fighting fatigue i should be over side affects by now its been about 10 weeks and im inbetween drs appointments it sucks iv never had this much side affects maybe rash or nausea  i almost want to go to the ER but trying wait it out hoping the doc gives me something else cause i have a lot of anxiety on top of it,1
"I totally relate to this.. Sounds like youre talking right out of my head!!! I cant shake this horrible tired.. I was tired constantly before i started the meds n they started me at 25 mg of limictal, after the first 11 days on that dose i was gtg.. Then they doubled that n i am on now 50 mgs and i HATE this feeling!!! I have had a headache seriously since i started the medication. I feel more anxious and far more down than before i was medicated. From what i can tell from other people, this is part of your body adjusting to it. I am told to keep trying it but the goal is to get me up to 200mgs and i already want to die at just 50mgs. Ugh.. Keep at it, talk to your prescriber, and try to remember that this is just a phase and that it WILL balance out at some point :( sorry im not more help n dont have answers but you are defiantly not alone in the way youre feeling :(",1
"Can't say it Enough Talk to your Dr - some meds need others to work better or that med might be to strong. But when we first get put on meds to help our Minds get what it needs we do sometimes crash, you probably have not slept good in a long time so your body will make up for that once the mind is getting the right amount of meds it needs, we All go threw guilt You have to remind yourself you took a step to make your and your Son and Family's life better, You have taken control.",1
"Most people with this illness need medication. To me, it's a quality of life choice. I take the minimum amount of medication to control my disease, because the quality of my life is better with it, than without it. Why choose misery over relative wellness? I don't want to just survive, I want to LIVE.",1
"I tried the no medication route and the anxiety became so bad that my hands and feet became freezing cold and mind, my chest hurt like I was having a heart attack, no more of that! I need to be medicated",1
"I hate the part of ""Who am I ?"", ""Is this really me?"", etc, of meds and bad side effects, which is why I'm getting off Gapentin and Cymbalta.
I've been on Gabapentin for 4 or so years for migraines and possible mood help. That's a bitch to get off of.
Cymbalta, though, pretty easy.
I have Suicidal Ideation, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Psychotic Depression w/ Manic episodes...
I don't have much support, save for my mother and a few other people, but I am currently training a (currently 11w/o) Chow/Boxer/Husky/Staffie Pit to be a Service dog☺
Hopefully I can be fully off my meds(minus the birth control) within the next 3 months... The doggo is my Service puppy in training, Spencer☺",1
I take meds for my Bipolar 2 Disorder. I don't think that they help me though. I'm still struggling a lot with my moods and with my depression! Living with Bipolar Disorder and-or with depression makes life so difficult!,1
"I was on a list of medications that would scare people at one point in time... I am proud to say that I have been off all psych and epilepsy meds for over four years! There are days i feel like it's too much to handle, but overall I am dealing better off the meds than I ever could have on them!! It is doable!! And it is worth it!!!",1
"I started seeing a naturopathic doctor after my psych basically told me I'm out of med options. I'm not on any meds but have changed my diet drastically (gluten and dairy free), am taking iron supplements, will be adding some homeopathic remedies soon as well as probiotics and protein shakes to fix ""leaky gut"", and keep my stress as low as possible for now. It has worked amazingly! I can definitely tell how my mood changes and how much more susceptible to changing emotions I am when I eat gluten or dairy now that I've gone off it. It might not work for everyone and some people can do it while staying on a very low dose of medication (I might have to go back on low dose of lithium once stress increases) but I figured it was certainly worth a shot! My dr tries to treat my whole body. I'm also seeing an acupuncturist who does stuff with my head and gives some Chinese medicine advice for it. I'm currently doing more and more research into Chinese medicine and reflexology and natural medicine stuff. It's amazing how deficiencies and poor diet can affect your brain. Also, I was testing for neurotransmitter deficiencies so I'm waiting to hear the results and then will take a naturapathic approach to correcting them!",1
"I have trouble understanding this (no disrespect.) it was explained to me throu a medication drug trial. If someone is diabetic and needs to have insulin but doesn't want to cos it's 'medication' you would be cross at them. Their body needs the medication to help their body as it doesn't make the insulin. The same goes for depression just a different organ. My brain doesn't make enough of the chemicals it needs to get me throu just like a diabetic doesn't make insulin to get them throu. 
I even tried on meds that were to low and I just couldn't keep my head above water but now I'm settled on the meds that are working for me I have no desire to go back to the horrid struggles. Don't get me wrong things aren't all peachy and good I still have struggles but I'm much better at managing those times. 
The other thing I learnt was people wait to look to get help. People wait 2-3 years before speaking to the doctor and they should be seeing someone after 2-3 weeks. I have someone close I spoke to saying 'if u notice I'm not good u need to tell me' those close know something isn't good and they are the ones that need to say something so u can seek help.",1
I deal with my anxiety by taking my meds....I also confront my anxiety but pushing myself to the limits...,1
I've been dealing with mine on my own... Even thinking of meds makes me anxious     ,1
"If it were high blood pressure and you changed you diet and exercise and still suffered, wouldn't you then talk with your Dr. about a low dose medicine to help you feel better?",1
I do...its a struggle but focus on positivity and remove the triggers that set you off ...hope that helps,1
"Try to find a doc who will do extensive blood work to make sure all hormones are balanced, and everything else is balanced. Integrative Family medicine doctors do this and prescribe bioidenticals if needed.  Then cut out gluten and anything else irritating to balance.  Read the book ""The Mood Cure"", especially if you don't want pharmaceuticals",1
"I'm on medicine but I'm horrible at taking it, but I do notice a huge difference when I'm doing good and I'm on it.  It makes me feel soo much better",1
I'm not.  I've read too many horror stories.  Seems like a case of the cure being worse than the disease.,1
"I don't medicate. Sure I take vitamin D to help but I stop or reduce my use in the summer. Some days I quite simply have to deal. I have to cry my way through it, pretend I feel happy, put on false smiles when I feel like I can't even breathe. Feeling like everyone would be better off without me. I have to struggle through and if I didn't have the partner that I have supporting me it would be a lot harder.",1
I've been off an on medications over the yrs ..it totally depends on my stress level at the time.. I never pushed my son into taking meds either..it's definitely a personal choice.. my son asked to try meds a year ago at the age of 16 and it was his decision.. and it has been helpful..he even made the 4.0 honor roll for the first time... even with a learning disability ...I have also managed a youth mental health group home for  the last 13 yrs and our clients have a says in their medication management as well ♡,1
I'm am currently off all my meds.. I'll get back on them if I need to but I've been using vitamins and supplements and I also recently moved to CO where pot is legal and I have found a couple strains that help my anxiety.  It's new to me but I hate meds (and yes I know that's part of bipolar) but I have other health issues and it isn't smart for me to be on 20 different pills every day that do affect my liver and kidneys very badly.  I will say I always end up back in them when or if I have a bad manic episie but so far I'm keeping that under control by making myself eat and sleep.  That seems to break up a manic cycle.  Take it if you need to but if you can manage without it I personally feel like that's a better way to go if you can handle it all.,1
"Yes and no. When first diagnosed with depression, SAD , and ADHD I was put on meds for all three at the same time. Longggg story short, it wasnt until many months later that I realized the anxiety meds did nothing for me, and that the regular frequent and increasing dosage was why my grades tanked that spring.. although I had asked previously and was told otherwise, I found out that the benzo was giving me memory loss and preventing me from retaining new info. I was in vet school at the time, obviously such side effects create MORE anxiety for me!  I spent the next year off and on each med trying to figure out what the heck was happening. Dealing with depression and panic attacks along the way. Found a new doctor after concluding it wasnt getting better without meds. New doctor. She thinks my anxiety and depression may actually stem from not controlling my adhd. We have been 10 months in now for just adhd meds without anxiety or depression meds. Not quite perfect yet, but better than where I was. If I could afford more therapy sessions with the psychologist I think I would be much much better, and if I could get out of my living situation (the environment has triggers that would not be tolerable for healthy people at times)",1
"I was on lamictal and seraquel 10 years ago, and they both incapacitated me to where I couldn't leave the house. That lasted for a month then jumped off all my meds, cause that just ain't no way to live. My life is a great big struggle, but I'd rather live and screw up on a daily basis than be a walking zombie.  :)
So, nine years off all of it. No regrets.",1
♡ That's my biggest fear. It affecting my kids more in the long run!,1
"I have not been on medication for several years now. I was not able to find one that really worked. For me, I started eating differently and exercising. I started making time in the sun (just 15/20 minutes) a day a priority. It's hard to do that in the winter, here, however I do what I can. I do, still, have severe lows. I won't lie and say it's easy, it is just working for me. I hope that everyone is able to find something that works for them, be that medicine or not. So much love, to all who are struggling!!",1
"The last medication I was on I had very strong suicidal thoughts and I even ""self harmed""  so I have been scared to try anything else! That's why I'm not medicated!!!",1
"I have worked for years on my A/D. This is what has helped me. For depression, I take 5-HTP and walk. When I walk I have my talks with God and give all my problems to him. I also sort a lot out walking. I know who I can talk to when I'm starting to feel depressed. I don't try to hide it anymore. For anxiety I deep breathe. Some people have a mantra they repeat to get past the anxiety. I just talk to myself and remind myself I am ok. I also avoid stimulants.",1
"I'm too scared to take all those meds,,the side affects scare me to death, I would like to try the canibus but don't know where from where I live,,,",1
"You will know if you need medication.  It is a matter of functioning or not functioning for me, life or death; however, mental illness runs in my family. It is genetic for us. I have not had the traumatic experiences which cause some people problems, such as abuse or fighting in a war.  I think the cause of the mental illness has a great deal to do with the maintenance of the illness.     I am not a professional. I have had a mental illness since I can recall; I was about 5 years old (depression) and am now 39 (bipolar 1 and ocd). Life is a struggle sometimes, but I can live a relatively ""normal"" life.  It is a personal decision, like taking any other medication--for instance, if high cholesterol runs in your family, diet and exercise may not be enough to put your symptoms and numbers in check. In that situation, after the other changes have failed to make major alterations, you may be prescribed medication by your doctor; however, it is your personal decision to take them or not. Good luck to you, and blessings on your journey!",1
"I always feel like it's more of a hassle to go to the dr.s  and try to find the right meds. I was diagnosed when I was 15 but I refused to do anything about it. I'm 26 now, and my current Dr.  I have only told her about my anxiety and major depression..... Most days I can be ok. But others I don't get out of bed. I have two young kids. And it drives me insane that I don't have the energy or care to get up and do something. I can manage to make sure there fed and clean, but sometimes that's the best it gets. I don't work right now so it not like I have places to be.  Mental illness/addiction runs in my family I've lost 5 family members in the last 3 years to overdosing,I have also had traumatic experiences while I was a child,  and now as a adult.  I don't have a support system. So it's hard.  And I'm scared to keep trying do the right med. I know it would make a difference If i actually told my Dr. I'm bipolar and was re-evaluated now that I'm older and its worse but I'm to  scared I guess.",1
"I've tried meds before with no such luck, I decided to try nutritional response testing (acupressure) and found out I had tons of mercury and aluminum in my system which basically caused me to be in fight or flight mode all the time and made me have unbearable anxiety and depression. Changing my diet and detoxing from the heavy metals and I feel so much better!",1
Im perscribed meds. But i dont take them. I struggle everyday to function. My family n friends try to tell me i need them.,1
I am currently unmediated as I am breastfeeding I did have the option of taking my medication with regular blood tests for both Bub and I but chose not to. I struggled throughout my pregnancy but seem to be doing ok now (8 months later) I struggle with anxiety at times and have recently struggled with high moods. I was just thinking today a I am looking forward to going on my medication though.,1
"I need to be on meds or I lose touch with reality, get very paranoid, and slip into a psychosis. I have bipolar 1.",1
"100% no medication, never been on them. I am able to handle my anxiety/depression without medications. I find music and working out my coping mechanism",1
"Yes I work full time for a general surgeon. 

Work out is my escape - pulg  in my head phones and blast my music.

I am married with two small children, so yes I do support a family. I may add my husband has a TBI and PTSD so I'm the only one who works. Not much family support as I don't talk to anyone about it because of my husbands own issues

Look I'm sorry if I am able to handle anxiety and depression without medications. Not everyone needs medicine, what is with bashing people who can self manage? Usually that's a good thing...",1
I'm not taking meds. They make me so ill I gave up on them. 15 years of different types and they all floored me. Just struggle along now best I can.,1
"I'm 31. Diagnosed at 19. Every medication I've been on makes me sleepy and makes me feel like a zombie.  I have 3 kids, I can't be sleeping all the time.  I do not take medication and haven't for about a year now.  Some days I struggle, but for the most part I've learned how to deal with my emotions and not be on the emotional roller coaster.",1
My personal experience get ready to be a guinea pig it took decades n numerous doctors to find a combo of six different medications that keep me stable n it takes weeks to see any affect but I suffer from three different diagnosis my point is yes it can get better im way better on medications than without but its a long road of trials be open n honest with your doctor tell them everything even if its small or embarrassing its the only way to get results,1
It all depends what is prescribed. If you can handle whats going on stay natural but if it is thatn bad your life is getting interrupted i would worry about that and get fix. More than sex,1
"I get like you when my anxiety is at its highest peak. I have to go and be alone in my room. After I disconnect from people and noise, it just gets too chaotic at times, I can most likely return and try my best to keep as calm as I can. Anxiety is a monster. Their are many different meds to help, I just happen to be med sensitive to most. Peace to you!✌",1
"I think each and every person who posts about their struggles and triumphs while handling their respective mental illness(es) is very brave! Respect is deserved for being able to be open about something so private! Kudos, and praying for the day I can be so brave!!",1
Im so sick of closed minded people who have no idea what it is to suffer from mental issues nobody asks for this n if your not a person with a illnesses or a doctor you'll never understand my heart has become hardened to this world I suffer from bipolar depression anxiety and have border line personality disorder and a schitso affective I spell horribly sorry my point is I have become very blunt n honest I tell ppl this upfront cuz I don't care what you think of me im me n cant change that if you cant deal with it theres the fn door n get out of my life dont be ashamed for who you are and remember you are not alone n although we dont know each other personally I am allways here to listen to someone who is struggling mentally best of luck,1
"I feel like this is a version of the decision I have to make when someone asks how I'm doing. Do I give them the polite answer or the real one? Not always an easy decision to make nor is it ever comfortable. and I also have been on the other end, sometimes it is NOT helpful to me to be on social media, and sometimes it is not helpful to my health to hear about someone I care much about is struggling because I really do take all of that upon myself.. (I was told by a friend that my skills in being so sympath/empathetic was a gift, but often times it is more of a curse). HOWEVER. i think the best thing you can do in this situation is to thank said family member for communicating that to you, and offer them steps THEY can take to avoid seeing such posts. It is possible to stay friends with someone and not see their posts on the newsfeed (this past election year for the US I learned real quick how to do that to extreme friends on all sides ;)  ) . keep your cool and remember, it could be as simple as them not getting it, or  maybe not being able to handle it and approaching you about it (even if it was in a rude way). IF it is really messing with your day, wait to respond until you are feeling a bit better (I definitely know how this goes, you don't want to ruminate excessively on a response... nor do you want to say something you will regret later, or be anxious about it. I assume as a family member, you will have to interact with this person again regardless what is said on facebook). again, if the posts you make are helpful to YOU, I feel you should be able to continue them without regret BUT maybe in the response if you feel comfortable doing it explain that to said family member how it is helping you by posting while acknowledging that it may not be helpful to him/her and presenting fair options to help this person filter it on their end.",1
"My assistant pastor told me that it wasn't a ""faith statement"" to post, but for me it is VERY therapeutic. I've found many online/friends turned out to be bipolar, suffering depression, which helps to know folks know what you're going through. It's kind of alarming when you realize the numbers too. BUT, I post anyway, subscribe to pages like this (and on Twitter also), and note in a diary app. I even created a totally private page with a pseudonym wherein I can post exactly whatever and keep it to myself. Not on it much, but it's my page. I can understand them being affected because it is pretty weighty. I'd suggest creating a closed or private group and inviting only those folks who are genuinely supportive, who want to understand. Love & prayers!!",1
"Keep on posting.... This is about your journey, and if they are so uncomfortable with the information availed for them to get educated and maybe have some empathy, then let it be their problem not yours...They don't have to read your posts but you have the right to do what you are doing... Good luck & God Bless ❤️",1
I always pretend to my family and friends because I know it upsets them but if they dont like it they dont have to read it xx,1
"Sorry, that should say 'affect'. A lot of people will balk at this but part of dealing effectively with your condition is building resilience and self will and confidence. That's nice talk for 'You have to toughen up'. I know it's hard and it feels like going against yourself, but to live well with your illness you will have to grow a thicker skin, because people are hostile to things they don't understand and they are also very reluctant learners.",1
"I brag because there are days I can't, I've been dealing with this illness since I was 19 so it's been more than half my life, I now keep a little,,, wellI call it my emergency backup kit, with toothpaste, shower wipes, dry hair shampoo, brush everything hygeine,  the struggles go on, but I can't let it destroy other health care",1
Maybe if you know you're getting anxious and depressed about it...slow down. .and focus on just you. .and I don't mean masturbation either.. breathing exercises..meditate... read books.. cook food you love.. try to not be sexual.. it may help you figure out why you feel this way.. just an idea. .feel better,1
i use my alarm on my mobile the alarm doesnt turn off until i turn it off reminds me everyday,1
"Keep ur phone with u set ur alarm to the time u take ur meds, the time u take them is crucial",1
"I keep mine on the dining room table in front of my chair. I have to take some of mine w food, so it's easiest to remember if they're right in front of me when I eat. Morning and night. I also set an alarm on my phone for 11am, because I'm bad about forgetting to eat breakfast, so it's a reminder to eat and take meds if I haven't already.",1
Set alarms on your phone.,1
Put an alarm on your phone I need to again it works. There is an app,1
I have alarms on my phone. And hubby usually asks me at bedtime if I remembered. :),1
You could set an alarm on your cell phone.,1
"Here is my technique- I have 8 boxes with 7 days a piece- the yellow one I pack with morning meds and the blue ones with evening meds (I take about 20 each morning and evening) so once packed I have a month of meds, I keep one set on the dining room table (no kids around) and if the correct color is not showing my husband will just say have you taken your meds?  I rarely miss my meds with this system.  I am 60 with bipolar 1 and recently diagnosed anxiety disorder.",1
"I have 2 weekly pill containers, one for AM, one for PM and I fill them up weekly.  That way i always know if I have taken my meds for the day or not.  I also used to set alarms on phone for morning and night time.",1
I have a day of the week dispenser I carry with me. That way if I am unsure if I have taken them or not I can just check that particular days section. I fill it up straight away every wednesday after I have taken that days meds. Also the reminders on here help :-) x,1
I set alarms on my phone & keep the bottle in my fist until I do!!,1
I use a pill box and also set an alarm on my phone,1
They sell pill boxes with an alarm on them. Check amazon.,1
Alarm on your phone for everyday.,1
Try a dosette box you fill it once a week and put it somewhere you will see it.  Try it with an alarm on your phone to remind you,1
I set an alarm on my phone to go off at the time I'm supposed to take my med,1
You could get a locking pull caddy that when it's time it turns and sets off a loud alarm.,1
"I dread the night,ITS THE WORSE     ",1
"From a support persons perspective I don't ""throw it back in their face"" but do point out the irrational thinking and behaviours so when an  manic episode is starting my loved one will understand when I say ""your getting sick "" and will hopefully get the proper support BEFORE all the trouble lands them in the psyc ward, jail or worse dead. (So far only 2 out of 3 but my biggest fear is the one we have been able to aviod so far)",1
"It is a horrible horrible disease for the afflicted and their loved ones. I sit here one of the collateral damaged, but I know for my mom, the afflicted with manic depression it was a greater hell she was in than mine.",1
That's actually true I hv been struggling with bipolar disorders since years of ...medication has not helped me n my own confident don't understand,1
"Guilt is such a huge struggle for many of  us. 

I carry it around every day and it's exhausting, but it's so hard to let go of. I can feel your pain just for reading your post. The fact - that you think about it, makes you a great mom. We just have a hard time forgiving ourselves. At least I do.",1
"I'm Bipolar 11 which is diagnosed major depressive episodes, hypomania, talking way to fast, we are fidgety, can't sleep for long periods at a time without feeling sleepy, kinda like being on a speed drug, mania causes you to act irrationally, like just packing up and leaving everything behind, when you finally become more rationale again you=e like what the heck did I do, our thought process is way out there in left field beleive g that what we say is the gospel, we are difficult  to treat, coming up with the right drug combination is  difficult, hope this helps  those that don't understand The scale ,  ",1
This is new to me but i understand it im very bipolar and i make destructive decisions and irrational choices what type do you think i am?  Be nice to see what yall think so when i get to dr i get medicine that helps,1
"I have a child the same, and a partner with ADHD, I understand somewhat of what you go through, it's soo stressful",1
sometimes the soul is big and bright and the ONLY way to satisfy it is LOCATING its counterpoint and not forcing something that you KNOW you don't feel BECAUSE YOU WILL BE MISERABLE,1
Idk i get very shakey during and anxeity attack,1
Yep. They will never understand the struggle,1
"I can't make simple phone calls or answer them 
That stops a lot of thing currently flowing in my life to continue to flow with ease
I rely to heavily on my partner to do simple things I should be able to do 
Even like going to the doctors to getting my anxiety dealt with seems like it takes months of coercing for myself ...etc",1
"When I'm overwhelmed I just pull away.  The few channels and connections that need to be made are kept going as they are a necessity.  Other than that, there might be some hard decisions that you just have to make in your favor.  We need some wins.  I hope my little rant was not bothersome.  I have my own mental illnesses, everyone has their own.  This works for me.  If it works for someone else, great.  If not, sorry.",1
yep same hear I have to get someone to come to the doctors and even then I often cant go. I constantly cancel things and avoid the phone door ect,1
"I have trouble understanding this (no disrespect.) it was explained to me throu a medication drug trial. If someone is diabetic and needs to have insulin but doesn't want to cos it's 'medication' you would be cross at them. Their body needs the medication to help their body as it doesn't make the insulin. The same goes for depression just a different organ. My brain doesn't make enough of the chemicals it needs to get me throu just like a diabetic doesn't make insulin to get them throu. 
I even tried on meds that were to low and I just couldn't keep my head above water but now I'm settled on the meds that are working for me I have no desire to go back to the horrid struggles. Don't get me wrong things aren't all peachy and good I still have struggles but I'm much better at managing those times. 
The other thing I learnt was people wait to look to get help. People wait 2-3 years before speaking to the doctor and they should be seeing someone after 2-3 weeks. I have someone close I spoke to saying 'if u notice I'm not good u need to tell me' those close know something isn't good and they are the ones that need to say something so u can seek help.",1
"Im glad you made this statement, i always wonder if meds are good for me or not. I think it depends on the 'severity' of your illness. Some people are born with it and really just have to learn to cope. Therapy and medication help those individuals. But my mother believes in trying to better your state of mind naturally. Whether its waking up early amd starting a routine, cleaning, exercise, arts and crafts. Changing your lifestyle to where you are a little more productive can make a big positive change in your life. When im active, im happier, when im not, i se to dwell on negitivity. For me its jist a battle of staying active, staying positive. I tale meds, no therapy, but i do lots of arts and crafts.",1
"I was on medication for years, but it just made me very tired and gain weight.  I've been off since May.  I can get really anxious sometimes, but I try to go for a walk or listen to music and it will usually pass.  I'm hoping exercise will help too.",1
Why be so miserable when you don't have to be? Meds really do help most people. :),1
I did say most people. There are plenty out there that can't tolerate them. I'm sorry for your struggle. This thing is a crazy ass beast! :(,1
"Ive tried numerous prescription  medications, and was more miserable on them than off! I do occasional use cannabis to relax me",1
"I smoke cannabis oil and it will help being manic symptoms down like rapid heart beat, racing thoughts, anxiety, the urge to constantly be doing something... it really helps prevent manic episodes",1
Yes. Sometimes the anxiety  can be too much for me! I have found some good edibles that gives me the calm that I need! I just can get them all the time!,1
Yep. It can increase anxiety temporarily but the relaxation that comes afterward is so comfortable. :),1
Sometimes it's necessary. There is no sense in struggling through life when there are things out there that can help you live a more fulfilled life!! Good luck my friend!! I'm here if you need an understanding ear! Plus I'll be graduating in May with a degree in Psychology & certification in Crisis Intervention.,1
"Nicole, I would love a life without meds, but my life was not what I wanted it to be without meds. I have come to accept that I will always be on meds. The depression would eat me alive. I don't try to push, just letting people know my experience on the meds I'm on or have been on. I have Biplor II. The irritability and rage was too much for me to handle on my own. Good luck to you whichever road you choose.   ",1
I've been smoke marijuana most of my adult life and it helps me better than any pill I've tried. Everyone is different and some say it makes them paranoid so CBD oil might be a better place to start than just smoking the flower depending on how it may effect you.,1
I have been on every man made med since I was 14 and I'm now 31.. I straight up told my doctors..no more.. medical cannabis is my choice as it's natural and great to help me eat and sleep. . And calm my horrible thoughts which are constant. It isn't for everyone but just thought I'd throw it out there    good luck   ,1

"Stop taking it personally and trying to be her savior. Use your understanding to recognize that her symptoms cannot be relieved by you. What works for you might likely not work for her. She must find her way for herself. Your job is not yo fix her, only support. She is probably pulling away from the pressure you are putting on her not to isolate. She's going to isolate, like it or not. Its part of the symptomology.",1
I'm scared to go back on my Lithium.  I rather drink in my house..,1
I thought avoiding eye contact is a Autism thing?,1
It can also be anxiety. A lot of people with anxiety won't be able to make eye contact. I used to do it when mine was really bad. Always kept my eyes on the floor or on things around me. For some reason it freaked me out to look people in the eye.,1
"See your doc, tell them its an emergency or call an out of hours one , you must be feeling dreadful big hug",1
"WTH?  I was told to never manufacture excuses for how I acted or how I felt.  It is a disease, not something to be victimized!

COME ON, ADMINS, you know this is not the message we want to put out there for people suffering Depression, Bipolar, or anxiety!  I've been seeing too much of this like of postings on this site for my liking.",1
"But re-reading this post it's not really one of the bad ones, when you are struck with bipolar/depression/anxiety it does make you feel pretty helpless.",1
I have a horror story about that medicine. A friend's brother had a very tragic reaction to it.,1
"First of all if you can you need to go and fight this out at your pharmacy and have them correct the problem. This has happened to me before but the pharmacy will be shaken by you confronting them about you going cold turkey off your meds. You can't and shouldn't do thus. It is very dangerous. If it's there screw up they need to fix it. But, deal with them face to face..  good luck",1
"I feel this way all the time off and on...that's the horrible reality of bipolar disorder. Did you take you medicine as directed? You shouldn't run out before the next refill. If that's the case, you need to be really careful about that...if not, talk to your doctor about adjusting your prescription. Call them and tell them what has happened. Most of them are more than willing to help fill the gaps with your meds.",1
"I have PTSD, but I'm also a clinical therapist. I would advise to see your doctor and ask for an anxiety medication in addition to the antidepressants. Antidepressants don't help for panic attacks and if your out of the months supply already. You might be trying to self medicate with the wrong meds. Taking more than the prescribed antidepressants can give you side effects like suicidal thoughts. I would even advocate you smoking a marijuana joint. It has instant calming effects. Call your doctor.",1
"I used to be you. Don't worry you're not alone. We are even the same age. Sometimes the things that should make us happy get to be over whelming. Where do we go from here. Please work on making small reachable rewarding goals for yourself. When you feel like self harming. Play with your children. Be goofy force yourself to live. I've also started CBD it has worked wonders for me. I've also made some other changes as I suggested and I'm slowly figuring out that my life, my journey all depends on me. I have the power to control my thoughts. They don't control me. I hope you can find better outlets until your meds can be fixed. Stay strong and hang in there. You're loved more than you'll ever know.",1
"I have BPD and Bipolar 2, my bad days sneak up on me even though I am taking my meds as prescribed. When I notice that I am going down I distract myself, I keep my hands busy so I'm not itching to harm myself. I knit and to take my mind off things I watch series or a movie. If you have pets, they are great for therapy. Marijuana does help alot with anxiety. In this last year I haven't been able to have much therapy because money has been super tight so I had to teach myself to cope. Please phone your doctor to adjust your meds so you have enough for the month, if you find you can't cope with what I've mentioned for distracting yourself then definitely go to the ER, they will be able to sedate you to keep the edge off before you can get your prescription. Best of luck. I hope things come right.",1
"CBD oil helps really well with anxiety and depression. It's made from marijuana but without the THC that gets you high. It's over the counter in health stores in Florida, pretty sure it is in all 50 states right now.",1
"You can find it on the iternet, they have it in vape form and in candy form too. Im still doing my research on a company that sells online before i try. I have a chronic disease as well as depression anxiety and bipolar.",1

"I'm against Marijuana, but when it's for medicinal purposes, I'm all for it. My daughter used to get bad anxiety attacks so I took her to get some Marijuana. The guy there explained what would help her the best. It helped her and I'm grateful for it being sold. I'm not saying to buy some because that would be your choice. You should find out about your medicine. God bless.",1
"I would talk to your dr about an adjustment if you are already out of your medication. Either you need a higher dose or something else because while some anxiety meds are ""as needed"" antidepressants are taken regularly at the same time same time every day to be effective. Either way, please talk to your dr because you don't have to suffer!",1
Eating a Apple a day also helps with anxiety and depression,1
I'm 23. My life isn't together and I have depression and bad anxiety. During an attack tell yourself to breathe through it and that your okay over and over again. As far as self harm goes look at yourself in the mirror tell yourself your beautiful and that you don't want to hurt yourself over and over again until the feeling goes away. You got this I feel your pain I really do. You can get through this and also let your husband know how you are feeling so that he can watch you and help you through this.,1
"Ahh,  yes.  So true.  Shame we have to hide sometimes.",1
"I can sure relate my mental illnesses to him. Jezzzz I still miss, mourn him dearly. Especially daily when I see his movies, comedy show..Mork & Mindy,, Mrs. Doubt fire...        ",1
the other scars i view with contempt and shame and want them out of my sight.,1
I've seen some pretty awesome tattoos to cover cutting scars. My son cut for a short period of time. We were moving from California to Louisiana. He was so upset about moving. That's when it started. I immediately took him to his psychiatrist. He was 14. Now he's 18. He hasn't cut since.,1
When I wasn't medicated I usually got so mad that I'd usually go and punch a steel locker to avoid punching others. I left multiple deep fist shape dents in the steel. broke my knuckle a few times. one time my knuckle was swolen for a month. Its very dangerous for me to not be medicated. one wrong word and id kill someone.,1
Me too. No fear. Just rage. I just want to punch someone in the throat! I get very aggressive.,1
"when ever i get into that rage/irritation mode all i can feel is anger. I don't feel anything but anger. no fear or anything else. I plan on staying on my meds, just hoping i can get off the depakote. I really really dont like the weight I have gained.",1
I always say acceptance is the hardest thing in life. I'd kill to be the old me. Whenever I've tried getting off meds the bipolar comes quick. Irritable and full of rage and then I spiral way down into the depression. I just can't handle that. Please stay on your meds. I don't want you to die.,1
As soon as I start crying my eyes burn so much I have to stop because the pain gets so bad. And the longest I can go without my meds is about 4 days. after that the bipolar swings right on in. And i have come to terms that I will be on meds most of my life as well. I cant risk it. I've almost died way too many times because of my mood swings.,1
"Crying only makes it worse but it is an outlet for the depression. Then I get a migraine. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. I totally understand not wanting to be on more meds. I don't like being on all that I'm on, but I've come to accept that I need them and probably will for the rest of my life. I've tried going off of a few and it was a disaster. It was to the point where I should've been hospitalized but I just wouldn't put that worry on my kids.",1
"Yes.  Full neuropsych testing have me my iq, strengths, weaknesses, and an adhd inattentive type diagnosis.  On low dose Focalin.  It wired up the anxiety tho.  Chemical balances are so intriquite.",1
I vape CBD oil. It only helps my anxiety a little bit.,1
"I need to ask my doctor for an ADHD test because I've already been diagnosed with Bipolar 1, Generalized Anxiety, PTSD and borderline personality. I have SO many of the symptoms associated with ADHD, but I just don't know what to say or how to bring it up to my Dr.",1
"I had testing in the fall, there was a computer test and iq, because even after being stable for a few years i was still having extreme difficulty focusing.  My results surprised me, but showed adhd without a doubt and i was started on adderall.  Adderall was the missing piece of the puzzle for me.  It made a huge difference in my life, especially at work.  Best of luck to you!!",1
"I was never diagnosed with ADHD until around age 30, desperate, I did a round of tests like it sounds you did. I was complating going back to school but didn't want to if it was just some else I was going to fail at. My results were helpful. The IQ testing gave me a number that told me I wasn't too stupid to try this, and when we found the right medicine... let's just say I made an A in a course I had failed once and taken an incomplete in the second time. Since you've already finished testing, find out everything you can from them. It reassured me and can help you in making plans for the future.",1
"The IQ test scared me the most. Don't know my results of it yet, but curious to know what affect it has on diagnosis with ADHD. Are people's IQ with ADHD high or low? Maybe he was testing it to see if i had learning disabilities I suppose. 

I get what your saying though! Always wanted to go to college, but I can't read or study to save my life.",1
"Testing for all that?! Get another Dr.  Be just honest and open with your symptoms - all of them, even the good ones. Anxiety can be related to paranoia which is a scale and not just thinking aliens are after you or some shit.",1
"Makes my anxiety through the roof. However I have used CBD oil and it does help with my anxiety, but none of my other symptoms.",1
"I was misdiagnosed with ADD/HD growing up. My behavioral anomalies were actually symptoms of childhood anxiety. 

It was the 90s. Any kid who didn't sit still for more than 10 minutes had ADD to most doctors.",1
"My son has always been told ADHD. I always said that they were wrong. He now has diagnosis of szioeffective, mood disorder, acute anxiety. Took many years but have the right set of therapists/psychs now and right combo of meds. His psychosis is very stable, moods are starting to stabalize but anxiety is sky high. Its a long road but keep going. There is the right combo out there.",1
"Well here goes the anonymous aspect of the post lol. I've been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety and Bipolar. That was from my psychiatrist. I'm on wellbutrin (which I love), lamictal and lexapro.",1
anytime the Dr's tweak your meds is usually a rough ride.  try to hang on while the new meds work their way into your system.  Music helps me...either playing or just listening to it.  don't be afraid of your emotions....just try not to add too much weight to them.  Good luck & Godspeed.,1
"Focus on something,anything.breathe. Pray. Make sure psych knows it's emergency you be seen.  If you can't wait until then you get dressed and you self talk yourself into going to ER you will be ok, I know I also have to do a lot of self assuring that I can go places. It's not easy. There comes a time where you have to do things that sure uncomfortable. You can do it!",1
Yes I can relate .. story of my life .. I'm not on meds but I also feel like not getting out of bed . I cant deal with my days  I'm always overloaded in my head ...Ive been falling into a deep dark hole myself . I don't think I can pull myself out again .. nothing is working for me either . I'm all alone . I've tried so many things  I don't have bipolar  but I do.l have depression and anxiety   And bpd  and sleep problems.. along with mild disabilities . I'm definitely at the suicidal point . Glad you are not there . I can't ever seem  to escape my head .. I can never get a break .. your not Alone . I understand completely .

I think u should call the doctor first things Monday. Tell them exactly how u r feeling and let them know it's an emergency. If they cannot get u in on Monday u need to ask them what u r suppose to do?? Be assertive and tell them that u need help. It's not okay for you to feel this way and mental health is as important as physical health! U must take care of yourself because you r worth it. I'm currently in a very similar situation and I make sure I let my doctor know. Dealing with mental health and the mental health field can be horrible. Until Monday I think you should take care of yourself. Take a nice warm bath or shower. Get ur comfy clothes on. Call someone who understands what u r going thru. Reach out to other here or send me a message. I know what u r going thru. You will be in my thoughts. Know that u r not alone in this!!,1
"Sorry for what you are going through ,agoraphobia I can relate my late mom and sister have dealed with this disease plus manic depressive  my entire lifetime  too much overthinking what will happen  the agoraphobia  will give you panic attacks  try do something get your mind off  these thoughts ,",1
I have been where you are its horrible the only thing that helped me was staying busy as much as I didn't want to I forced myself to get out of bed everyday to get dressed and to go out even if it was only for a short walk it helped - sending healing thoughts your way ❤️,1
"I have fibromyalgia, and it can add to the depression and anxiety. My whole body feels like flu aches. And intensifies with stress.",1
I suffer as well with anxiety and my body hurts think its a common symptom,1
"I have bpd and they tried soo many antidepressants etc before they found 1 that helped! I am currently on Paxil along with adder ral,lamictal, lithium, abilify which is a godsend and Ativan and baclofen for anxiety",1
"Put your keys or phone on to of them, alarm in your phone or a note on the door.",1
I put all my meds into containers every week so it's laid out easy.  Mornings are with coffee and night time is by the bed.   I also set and alarm for them on my phone just in case.  I also put my meds in different color containers.   Orange for morning and sunrise.  Blue for dark and sleep.  That way I never get confused.,1
I also have an alarm on my phone for my dinner and evening meds. I find this really helpful. My morning meds I've never had trouble remembering as I take them with breakfast.,1
Set an alarm on your phone. I have that plus I keep my meds in a dosett box beside my bed so I take them just after breakfast when I get ready in the morning and just before going to bed at night but the alarm is key. It takes 21 days to build a new habit. Taking Ng tablets is a habit we all need to get into.,1
"You have company. Most teens have gone through this stage. Yes, lots around you love you. Teens can be so cruel. My youngest daughter still suffers. Try all natural products n avoid anything with sylacidic acid which will just irritate the skin.   Most product out there for acne have this in it. She has success with Burts Bee blemish treatment; a roll on lemon glycerin, n aveno soy based face wash. Also, if your family has insurance tell you're parents the trouble your having n go to a dermatologist. Might be more than just the teenage acne most suffer through.",1
Please discuss the risks of accutane with your doctor before taking it. I know multiple people that had terrible side effects,1
"In my experience Accutane does work very well. Our 2 sons had horrible cystic acne during puberty. Their faces cleared up and the ""zits"" never returned. If you are female ... you CANNOT become pregnant. The drug can cause SEVERE birth defects. And suicidal thoughts. Enough already talk to your primary care doctor or psychiatrist NOW. You have no need to suffer, There are so many treatments available to you. If you don't have insurance go to a free clinic or planned parenthood. They are not just about ""sex, pregnancy prevention and abortions"". There is your school guidance counselor- they may have an idea. Good luck. I wish you the best.",1
"First thing you should do before anything is to go to a Dr. You don't want to take a chance and cause further damage. Everybody's face is different. Now I will agree that the acne is secondary. You need to work on your strength. Learn to not let people bother you so much. There are people out there who find you beautiful. If you need to see a therapist then do that. Or just find someone, anyone with a good heart. We all have faults. The mean people poke at you to avoid their faults. Fuck them!!!",1
"I have the exact same problem mate. Go to a doctor. The should prescribe you some pills and/or cream. The strong cream is called skinoren and the pills are called lymocycline. They really help me. And as for the people in your school, just ignore them. If it gets too far, don't hesitate to get help. If they harm you that's a completely different issue and I'm not gonna suggest you do what I did. But good luck. X",1
Suicide not an option! Talk to a kind doctor if depression is severe seek help immediately. Acne does heal i promise! I had it for years. Bullies are just horrid people talk to someone u trust,1
"How old are you? Do you leave in a hot or cold climate? Do you take antidepressants or birth control? I am a woman now 40 always had acne always will, stress breaks me out here it what I've done that improved it light 2 month level use of  accurate, no sugar no sweets no soda, more water, 1500 mg of l lysine daily, turmeric, salads added to diet good luck",1
Some forms of acne cannot be cured without prescription meds. I have cystic acne which was really irritated by my bi-polar meds. Go to a dermatologist. It usually only takes one visit to get it fixed. Please don't give up on yourself because it is something so temporary .,1
I use to use rubbing alcohol and worked whl younger but dint give a rats ass now.still get teased by it by insecure men. But they can go fuck themselves.,1
"I personally have never struggled with bad acne, but I've had friends who have and could never find a solution. I love natural products and making my own things. I've used it as body wash and a good many of my friends use it and love it. All different ages and skin types. Each ingredient has a purpose and I've even shaved my face, chest,  and legs to test it for women and to see how well it worked on freshly shaven faces, chests legs, etc. Here's my recipe for a great face wash. 

Coffee Grounds 
Brown Sugar 
Coconut Oil
Baking Soda 
Cucumbers 
Oat meal 
Honey 
Tea Leaves 
Tea tree oil 
lemon juice
Zinc
Melatonin
Sea salt 
Cinnamon

"My friend I totally understand your pain. While there are some good suggestions given here the only way to rid your face is going to be inside out! I had severe cystic acne. Not just a few whiteheads and some blackheads. I'm talking sever cysts and redness all over my body. It was horrific. And bullying doesn't do justice what peers said and did to me! First let me implore to you... You are worthy, you are valued and loved despite what others may say. Your outward appearance does not define you. And if people are bullying you,  well there is something wrong with them NOT you!! There are many treatments for severe acne and none of them have to do with greasy foods, or to much, chocolate. Stigmas absolutely exist with acne just like mental illness. Find a dermatologist and ask him to explain how Accutane works. You must be diligent with blood work and follow up with Dr's but I promise you it will be very worth it. Not only did it work for me but because it is hereditary my son got it bad as well. I immediately put him on this treatment with dermatologist supervision and within 1 school year he went from redness and cysts to not one blemish or pock mark on his face!! And went on to enjoy the last few years of his high school term. I refused to allow him to go through the horrific things that severe acne suffer with. Please please, if you want relief from this find a Dr and get started. If you have any problems getting the right info please do not hesitate to inbox me and I will help you as much as possible!!! Your life is so valuable and you are a blessing to many people even if it doesn't feel like it at the moment!!! Please don't give up!!!",1
"I've read vitamin D helps with acne, just taking it as a supplement, also try sleeping with a white pillow case because some dyes irritate the skin. There are a lot of things in a diet that can also affect the skin, and hormone problems as well.",1
"I totally understand. A few months ago, I was in the same boat. Sometimes people can be super sensitive to topical acne treatments. Salcylic acid breaks me out worse, and it's usually a first line treatment. The only thing that has mostly worked for me is a simple cleanser and moisturizer. I use cerave products, the gentle cream cleanser and the moisturizing lotion every morning, and at night I do the same and use the cerave serum - which has retinol, which is good from everything from fine lines to acne. Be sure to wear sunscreen because it has a tendency to make you burn faster for whatever reason. I know you'll have an overwhelming amount of responses, but just remember sometimes it's better to start from scratch. Also, I stopped drinking caffeine and I believe that has helped my skin immensely, as well, and my anxiety too.",1
"You have to determine your skin type, oily, combo, whatever to really pick the right otc products or else they don't help. Also, don't switch products constantly it irritates skin and expect it to get worse before when you do start something new because your skin may freak at first like what is this goop lol. If nothing worms see a dermatologist. Salicylic acid is made for acne.",1
"It takes time, so allow yourself to heal. Cry uncontrollably, scream to the top of you lungs. Feel sad, feel broken. But don't allow it to define you. You are NOT unlovable. This relationship was a part of you, but it's not you. Take this time to reflect on who you are, who you want to become and reflect on what you want from a relationship. If you get yourself in the right head space, the next time around you will be able to bring 110% into the next relationship.",1
I know exactly what you are going through my gf/fiancée of 16 years left me 2 weeks and 1 day ago . The heartache and the hurt is so unbearable that I can't handle it or stand it . I thought for sure I finally found the one that I could be with forever . She will and always be the love of my life .I still love her and care about her and worry about .  I miss her so much and love her so much that its killing me inside . We both have a mental illness / illnesses . It seems as the days go bye it gets harder and harder to live without her .,1
Bipolar is not easy deal with which one struggle everyday!,1
That is basically what I was told too. But I am bipolar  ptsd  social anxiety disorder  chronic depression.  Meds make a difference,1
"I have almost all of these symptoms. Doubt I have bpd though. Anger issues run on my family and the rest can be connected to depression, anxiety and having everyone except family abandon you after some time since childhood",1
I always thought this was in my head and I was a danger to those around me. Spent 3 months in physciatric hospital and now waiting for DBT therapy to start. Been out 9/10 weeks and struggling. Just wish I knew others that could relate to me.   ,1

"I'v not read any comment's just read this because it is not correct ,do not tell your self because you have BPD you think other that know you have this you are like this list they will think you are!!great worry:(",1
"This post isn't even accurate!

Signs and Symptoms

People with BPD may experience extreme mood swings and can display uncertainty about who they are. As a result, their interests and values can change rapidly.

Other symptoms include

Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment
A pattern of intense and unstable relationships with family, friends, and loved ones, often swinging from extreme closeness and love (idealization) to extreme dislike or anger (devaluation)
Distorted and unstable self-image or sense of self
Impulsive and often dangerous behaviors, such as spending sprees, unsafe sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, and binge eating
Recurring suicidal behaviors or threats or self-harming behavior, such as cutting
Intense and highly changeable moods, with each episode lasting from a few hours to a few days
Chronic feelings of emptiness
Inappropriate, intense anger or problems controlling anger
Having stress-related paranoid thoughts
Having severe dissociative symptoms, such as feeling cut off from oneself, observing oneself from outside the body, or losing touch with reality",1
"Story of my life., I struggle with these things daily",1
"With me people just thought I was explosive when I was angry and that was just my personality. My kids friends called me  the witch from the mountains. I now take three different meds but I have ptsd,  chronic depression. Social anxiety disorder and bipolar.  But I am so much calmer and easier to get along with now.",1
"Yes I know  just one of mine is over 900$ if my insurance didn't pay for it it's  horrible
 You know it only costs the drug companies pennies on the dollar to make the drugs.",1
I have these symptoms but have never been diagnosed with BPD.  I do take regular medication for anxiety though.  Should I be looking to be diagnosed and if so do I need medication?,1
"Most if not all of these are symptoms of other disorders or even things that people with neurotypical brains experience. You only need medication for something if it will improve your quality of life. If you have concerns that your current medication/diagnosis doesn't cover, talk to your doctor about them. They can make a determination about another diagnosis/changing your medication/what have you. Otherwise, don't worry yourself by assuming you have a completely different disorder when you might not fit the criteria at all.",1
"All those are me to a T,yet I'm remain undiagnosed.
I have manic depression and high anxiety, and insomnia",1
"I highly relate to all of the above, n its horrible, its like your trapped inside a bubble full of water and everyone around you is oblivious to it,, they can't help you because they don't no how to or they don't notice the difference in you.",1
"Right now I am more depressed than I think I have ever been,my mood swings are ridiculous, I either have insomnia or sleep for hours on end. I have a lot of other health issues and other things that I am dealing with right now that have me stressed out.",1
"No I haven't. I live in an area that people will abuse antipsychotic medicine and my doctor will not write prescriptions for anything that has ""street value"". Plus I am a recovering addict and recovering alcoholic so I am limited to what doctors will give me. I have been sober from alcohol only 18 days, I tried for months to get into rehab and had several trips by ambulance to the ER for having seizures from alcohol withdrawal and got turned away without any help. I ended up getting 2 DUIs in one week and ended up in jail,the jail doctor detoxed me with meds from the alcohol and I only had one mild seizure while I was there and luckily it was in front of the doctor. So she knew what to do and how to treat me. I am home now and on home confinement,really depressed and stressed...but I am sober :) been drug free for over 6 months.",1

I have BPD (borderline personality disorder) diagnosed 10yrs ago. It's a struggle everyday there are no mess for it but Dbt (dialectical behavior therapy )really helps. It has been the only thing that seems to help along with regular therapy.,1

My x girlfriend is bipolar and has other mental health issues. She is also struggling with an addiction to crack . We just recently broke up after 7 years. She lives in Oklahoma and we have had a long distance relationship for the past year. She has been on a sabotage pattern. She has been cheating on me with anyone who gives her any kind of attention. She has really ended any feeling l could ever have again with her. I was somehow trying to talk myself to think all of what she is doing is because she is in a maniac state rt now. She has been off her med and not even concern about seeing a dr. She says she says she is clear headed and is more like her real self than ever. She has been saying some very hurtful things to me about being with other people . I finally had to block her from every outlet. It is killing me to see her in pain but she doesn't seem to care about my pain anymore.  I have had to get in depression and anxiety medication due to all this. I don't know what else to do?,1
"I am also Bipolar plus OCD, Anxiety, PTSD and Depression. I tried all of the mood stabilizers and I would literally fall asleep at my desk at work. Abilify was great but weight gain was unbearable. I'm now on Effexor 225mg, Remeron and Trazodone.  I just started Remeron...weight gain again but I am to the point where I would rather have that than the alternative. It truly has been a god send. Good luck hun.",1
I totally understand. I'm rarely evened out or middle of the road. But now I've learned to sense it when it comes over me more. I still get way overwhelmed but too I try to get a handle on it. I'm on 4 meds. It takes patience and lots of work to control. Some can never achieve peace. I know I'll never be at peace...prayers for you.,1
"I'm bipolar 1 with mixed episodes.  And I totally understand.  It is very difficult to explain.  Everyone thinks it's one or the other.  Your either hi or low.  But that's just not the case.  I don't know if I could actually say anything that would help,  honestly.  Just know that your not alone,  there's lots of us out there. And do the best you can everyday. Not for anyone else but for yourself. I personally feel accomplished when I make it through those horrible episodes.  Because I made it through and you will too. Don't give up.  It took me a few doctors and a few decades to find the right meds for me but I finally have now. So again don't ever give up.  You will figure out what works best for you. Just keep being honest about everthing to your doctors. That's what's worked for me.",1
"Yes, its an uncomfortable feeling and I feel intense confusion .",1
A stable life. Sleep pattern all help. Stay away from stress / stressful ppl. Too much is sometimes not good. There are loads of side effects check urs change if necessary. Every case/ person different but just general advice.,1
I'm sorry. That's horrible.,1
What you're experiencing is called a mixed state. I experience them too although I've got type 2 bipolar. It can be really tough but I've experienced episodes of it where I function well considering everything that's happening in my head. Other times I really struggle. It's really difficult to explain unfortunately.,1
Yes definitely how I feel about it it's a daily struggle and a nightmare,1
Yep I struggle with this every day I try,1
Those who laughed don't truly understand what a real struggle this is,1
Omg I'm fighting tears right now! It's been a stressful emotional week for me!,1
"Wow,that's me   And it makes me upset to be like this!!!! No happy medium     ",1
"So the thing about that, is that intentional motional reactions can have a physical side effect. It's no joke that we tend to store our pain, our suffering , or even our stress into our body.  It may be side effects, but it's always a good idea to talk to your doctor.",1
I get short of breath and heart palpitations.  I saw the doctor but it was anxiety.,1
That is so true. My daughter goes through this and it's very hard to watch and understand. But if people would take the time and learn about how to help and handle the struggles of the people who have to struggle with this illnesses. You are correct If it was Cancer or something you could see then it is acceptable. So unfair for everyone.,1
"Hi there.  It sounds as though you have been through a lot.  Post natal depression can be awful, but of course depression can re occur later.  Good question; will you always be on them? I'd rather look at it in this way; rather than getting caught up with fixating on the medication as a bad thing, I believe if it is helping, if is making you feel better, if it is the crutch that is helping you live your life, enjoy your children, if is it allowing you to cope then surely it's got to be worth it and it is making the difference between your life working and not working.

I got so caught up at one stage when I had rebuilt my life and recovered in the idea that I had to come off them.  I thought I was coping well and knew I wasn't depressed.  I even went to the doctors and tried to discuss the idea of coming off them. I had convinced myself leading up to the appointment that this was the best step, but deep down I had a nagging doubt that if I encountered anything particularly difficult whether I'd be able to cope.

Luckily my doctor was great, we discussed it fully and she helped me to see that being on the medication isn't a sign of weakness, it's nothing to feel guilty or ashamed of and coming off them too quickly might not be the best plan.  I guess I knew that deep down, I had just got so caught up with the idea that to be fully better I needed to come off the medication.

I think especially if you have a lot of stress in your life it might not be the best time to come off.

Discuss it with the professionals, talk to your loved ones, but don't feel you have to rush into anything. Best wishes x",1
"Yes I've been on both , I dont have any med s I cut myself down slowly and never bothered again , I do get odd bad day and still feel anxiety at times but I try and stay away from stressful people and situations   ,just keep happy people around and situations ,I also started going to church ,god helps a lot too xx",1
"i gave up on the citalapram - it gave me that 'restless leg syndrome'. I had to take it at night, just before bed, otherwise it made me feel quite ill. Best thing i *ever* found for the anxiety/hyper-vigilance phases (I got ptsd too) are beta-blockers . they're f'kcing great. Saved my life a thousand times.",1
"Once you find the right meds.. it usually takes at least two or three together.. then you will have a big step forward. Meds can't take away personal issues in your life, but it will allow you to handle tense situations a lot better.",1
I have tried to go off meds  gradually several times but it didn't go well. I am currently taking 3 different meds for my depression/anxiety..I have accepted the fact that I will always be on meds.,1
I'm talking about cannabis. Sativa or Indica strains or hybrids can really help people.,1
Wish my dumb parents would get this thru there head so thru would understand how badly I'm struggling,1
Yes yes yes.. I'm so glad someone said exsactlly how I feel . Ppl act like I can just snap out of my depression. It don't work like that . I've been struggling for years with out meds . And right now I'm not in therapy and I really need it and I'm so alone and hopeless and my depression is suffocating me. I just want to die.. my thoughts are so suicidal and dark and morbid and. Very negative . I can't control it.. there so intense . I did not ask to have depression cans anxiety but I do but ppl make me feel like it's my fault dns I'm a bad person which lowers my already low self esteem ..,1
"Epilim is excellent !!!
The old mood stabiliser was lithium which was hard on the kidneys.
You do not have to worry about that with Epilim.
You can still experience highs and lows but they are not as extreme.
If you have trouble with grandiose mania's Seroquel is good. If you have trouble with depressions there are a lot of choices. Do NOT stop taking your medicine ever !",1
Remember things get better. We all had similar experiences. Try doing a little more each day things that  u like. Try see positives each day. Stay away from stress. Pray to God x,1
"I feel like you really need to tell your psychiatrist this because they can change up your medicine to help you. Especially ask for something for anxiety. I don't know how well it'd work on you, but Xanax has helped the best for me. I haven't had an anxiety attack or mental break down since taking it.",1
First I can't tell you what to do or how to do it. All I can  do is tell you my experience with this. I was born with brain damage Caused by the doctor. Which left me in a state of Really bad disorders. So you could say I LED what does from the day I was born. Not know why. I was so different from the other kids. Until I started asking questions. I learned about my disorders. But when it really got bad. This after my ex left. And took the kids to Parts Unknown.  I've had two nervous breakdowns. And the first one was really bad. I tried three times to kill myself. Twice with a shotgun and once with pills. It was weeks later my Doctor found out about the pills. Banding a map I took along with alcohol. I should have died that day. But I got the worst case of diarrhea. I had to sit on the toilet all day and half the night. I realized I couldn't kill myself. But I didn't know I was going to die Not once but twice in one evening. Months later. I had gotten bit by a rattlesnake. Halfway point between Where I live to where the hospital where I got the Anti-Venom because the hospital here only had two vials.  Halfway to the other hospital I had died twice. First time I died The EMT brought me back. But then I died again. The second time I woke up. And seen. EMT coming at me what the paddles To shock me Back to life. Which he almost shocked himself when I asked him what he was doing. Then I realize my chest was hurting me. He had been pounding on my chest to get my heart started back up again. He had told me. But during the time I was dead. I thought I would just dreaming. I still felt the pain and hurts. Not the physical hurts. But the mental hurts. That's what I learned. It don't matter You still feel the mental hurts even after death. Keep in mind I still think about suicide. But then I start to think about I'm still in pain even after death.  The best thing As find something you like to do. And do it. As long as it's legal. Fill your days with activities. So you don't have time to think. Even if it means doing it by yourself. Just don't stay And one spot and do nothing. This is not going to stop it from happening. But it will lessen the pain. Because if you're too busy doing something That can be enjoyable. Then you won't have time to think about the other things. The key is to stay active And do it when you don't feel like doing it. Also keep in mind don't push too hard. A little bit at a time will Build You Up. Then to try to do it all at once. Last time can be done with anxiety and panic attacks. Don't ever brush it or try to do it like others do it. Do it at your own pace. So get active and stay active. Also keep in mind no one can make you do anything. But nothing can be accomplished by doing nothing. Talk to who you can. Even if it's only on the internet. I hope and pray this can help you. But it's up to you to want to do it.,1
"I feel for you I can talk THIS WAY whenever you NEED
PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE OK",1
It sounds like you may be lonely too. Try reaching out to someone to do something with. Work with your therapist to figure out why you are depressed and having anxiety. You may want to go back to the hospital to get your meds changed up if you are feeling suicidal. I have been through all of the above. It's constant work sometimes to feel good. If i relax to long I back slide. One of the biggest things for me is being happy with my self. I am me and that is ok!! I have chronic mental Heath issues. I have chronic physical issues. I'm shy. My husband of 20 years dumped me for a new model. But I am learning that I am much more than these things. I have my good days and bad days. I will forever be a work in progress. I hope you are feeling better. Keep us up to date on how you are doing,1
Don't give up. Keeping testing the right med combo for you. Keep working. We have to work hard to identify our triggers and we learn a new one daily. Also I wanted to add a warning..if your bipolar and your doctor advise anti depressants rather then anti anxiety find a new doc people. Anti depressants (for most) bipolar souls only increases depression and intensify anxiety. The Good doctors know this and keep up with the ever changing discovers in the brain thats the one you want to keep... note disclaimer although it is my experience and the experience of many of the people I have met to have had adverse effects with anti depressants mostly Paxil and Prozac. They may be beneficial for some. Listen to your doc. Find your Zen when the dark creeps in.. music art writing coloring reading a book playing with you pet anything that you can put your hands on and Zen out on,1
"I'll be honest with you. Until you tell the world, and everyone in it, to kiss your @$$, life will not change. You'll always feel insecure. Anxious. Silent. Afraid. Scared. Nonbelievable. Stuck. I've been there. It took me dying, to live.",1
"This is my post

"Yelling is a part of verbal abuse and yes, it most certainly will effect her confidence and self esteem.Seven is a bit young yet to explain disorders but if one day you were to have a mother/daughter moment say brushing her hair, you could approach the subject and maybe also try to assure her that you will also try to think things through before you yell.My son had the same problem with me.I am softspoken but when i get scared because i told him not to do something and he did it anyway boy, that makes me mad.But i want him to be confident to speak up so i promised i would try not to blow up but he had to do what i asked him to do.",1

Hubby n I have 7 kids. This has worked from 3 up :)",1
"I think she is to young to know. Maybe in simpler terms. Say mummy gets tired. If u try organise things better or relax more. Have some time to urself each day get a good sleep. Go for a msssage maybe then this will help you to be calmer. I'm still struggling with most of these. Try see the difference between important things to be upset about and the not so important. Sometimes getting upset over smaller issues isn't worth it. Give her 5 mins to do something if she wants even if it is bedtime. My daughter same age. Spend quality time together. Obviously u know irritability is part of the illness. Just control what u can. Breathe . I'm sure most of ur have this issue. We coping with a lot esp with kids. Just make a few changes to help. Genetics is part of it but so is living environment. Make everything as nice as u can. Get her into good habits like tidying sleeping early. This will help for future, occasionally shouting not Gona affect so much but be aware do what u can to reduce it x",1
"I have had the conversation with my daughter with increasing details as she has grown. Mommy has a brain that doesn't think or work like others. I take medicine to help me, but I still will sometimes be overwhelmed. This is the cause for my frustration and why I feel the need to yell. It is to right to yell at you and I am very sorry.  I love you more than anyone on this Earth and I am trying my best to be a better mother to you. That is why I keep trying and sometimes it doesn't work. It isn't your fault and it isn't right, but I love you so much that I am doing everything I can to get help.  People aren't perfect and parents are people too.  Do you have any questions or what to tell me how you feel?
That is more or less how it goes.....and at least having the information and the facts could help her. I grew up not knowing why with my mother so I am trying to give her something she can be certain about.",1
"I worry about that too with my 1 And half year old everyday. I know she isn't old enough but family therapy isn't a bad idea. When she gets older the more she will understand but before I go off yelling, I ask myself, is what she doing age appropriate? (Such as climbing on things I've told her not to, exploring though mommy's purse ect), then I verbally identify my feelings and where they are coming from ( I am frustrated because I feel like I'm not being heard). It helps me alot and gives me a moment to cool off and come back to reality that she is a toddler before causing damage of yelling.",1
"There are websites to help you find ways to talk to your kids. When my daughter was 7 and my son was 11 I say down and explained the same thing to them. Children within this age range are very inquisitive and perceptive. They understand a lot more now, as their way of thinking is more logical and reflective. You should start off by talking about mental illness in general. Explain that just like a person can get physically sick, their mind can get sick too. You can then explain what BPD is, and how it affects you.

For example. You could explain, “Borderline personality disorder is a mental illness that makes the parts of your mind responsible for emotions sick. It stops you from being able to control your emotions. Which is why I am sometimes very angry, sad, frustrated or annoyed over little things that people normally feel just a tiny bit angry, sad, frustrated or annoyed over. How I feel is no ones fault, and I will get better so don’t worry”. Your child may feel the need to help you feel better, let them know it is not their responsibility and that there are special doctors who will help you recover from this illness. But you could also suggest a drawing from your child will make you feel good, so they don’t feel so helpless.",1
"I have a ten year old.I had to tell her straight out.I have bipolar 1,PTSD and ocd.I was also abused by an ex so every so often I have these nervous ticks and twitches, she kept asking what was wrong with me.Don't know if its right or not tell but I didn't know what else to do.",1
You need to take care of yourself first with meds. I know you don't mean it but it can be abusive and very confusing to a kid. Talk to her about the illness and get help. My mom was bipolar which ruined my childhood and it still hurts 20 years after her death. I will never forgive her for not taking the help when she was diagnosed.,1
"It's better to be honest I think..some type of person to guide you is a good idea. I think 7 is a fine age as long as you speak 7 year old..there are many uncomfortable things I had to explain to my kids..and not just about my mental illness. I'm sure you've had to also. I was a bit nervous when mental illness was the subject..but realized it just like explaining other stuff. Be prepared for tons of questions.. Or none at all..ya never know..I also found that even with a professional guiding me it was better that I did most of the talking. Only because. If there were more questions,  they would not feel worried to ask me because the pro. Wasn't around..that's just me tho. It'll be ok  ",1
Sorry. Also you don't have to go into the specifics or scary parts. Basic points of importance surrounding treatment..like..letting her know you have a nice Dr..helping..,1
Im bipolar 1 have anxiety and bpd mum of 5 2 of which are step kids 3 my own mental health is triggered through trauma as a child i was abused physically mentally and sexually best thing to do is take your meds get a mood diary go to all appointments maybe get you psychiatrist to refer you in to classes which are absolutely fab ive done anxiety and coping skills ans have helped me so much if you ever need a chat feel free to pm me always be honest with you child though ive always spoke openly about my mental health to my babies so when my bad days come they understand its me and not them also family support makes it easier too xx,1
"I spoke to my stepsons when youngest was 3 and again this year youngest age 4. I don't fully explain it but I told them sometimes I have trouble with my emotions and get really sad and cry a lot or angry and yell when you don't deserve it and I don't mean to do it. And anytime that I do yell and they don't deserve it, once I've calmed down I talk to them and apologize for my actions. This has stopped them from getting as upset when I get like that. (I'm rapid cycling bipolar, no meds) when I'm sad they try to comfort me without being overbearing. And if I'm really tired they will behave and let me nap on the couch (light sleeper) while they quietly play or watch a movie and they wake me if movie ends, they are hungry or thirsty. They are amazing at understanding how I am but I've also been in their lives from 6m and 18m respectively.",1
"Single mother of an 8 yr old boy. I deal with multiple mental health disabilities. Manic depressive disorder, multiple anxiety disorders, PTSD, etc..my son has picked up my anxiety and he is in therapy just like mommy is.. he is also old enough for me to talk to him and explain that I am sick and it's not his fault and never will be.. and that I don't want him to grow and have the issues that mommy has when he's older.  They may be children but they understand when it's from the heart. Hang in there         ",1
I agree with all the therapy responses.  But my personal opinion is I think 7 is still a bit young to try an explain a mental health condition.  Before I snap on my kids I NEED remind myself to think through what is I'm about to yell about.  Does it warrant raising my voice?  What words to choose and how to convey them.  Definitely consult a physician but I worry that my kids my blow off a scolding by chalking it up to depression and not taking me seriously when they really are in trouble.,1
"I disagree 7 is not to young. My kids are amazing 16,13,10, 7 and they have always understood i have. Mental disorders. In fact they are always there always understanding and have been the only ones in my life who are. They dont take it personally when I'm irritable and yes i do try not to let that affect them.",1
"I have the same problem here. I have anxiety and depression and I think I look for reasons to yell to help me cope better. Which is totally not fair to my 4 kids. My kids are good, I just get easily frustrated cuz my hubby can tone them out and I hear every little noise they make, they argue with each other and they all think they're the boss of each other. Tattling every 3 minutes. It seems like I never get a moment to think. I just want to scream, so I do. For silly things mostly. I haven't gone to a Dr in a while cuz I don't want there criticism. I guess I'm more ashamed of myself and when I talk about it, it really hits home base. And than the depression kicks in than I'm a mess. It's not a fun disorder and many don't understand.",1
"My daughter is 4. We talk about feelings. We talk about mommy getting grumpy and ""snapping"" and how sometimes emotions are too big, even for grown ups. I may go off in the moment, but its how you handle the aftermath that is important. Address it when you have an angry moment. I explain fully why i yell. Sometimes im scared (for their safety) and yell to stop them from getting hurt. Sometimes i get so frustrated i laugh. I explain that emotions are difficult and that my behavior isnt ok, but we have to keep working on it and talking together. All of that with my 4 year old. She gets it when explained on her level. (Bipolar and anxiety disorder here, btw). Find a simple way to explain that sometimes you cant help your moods, but you are working on it. Tell her to help if needed by maybe hugging you if she thinks you need it. Maybe an outside ""warning flag"" before you get too upset? It might help. The biggest part is explaining that she is NOT the reason you are that way. Everyone is made differently, and your brain is just a little different. And thats ok.   ",1
"Also, you occasionally yelling at her, isn't going to cause her to have a mental illness. She is at risk due to genetics. Also, extreme trauma/abuse can cause mental illness. So assuming you're not beating her or molesting her, you're NOT going to cause her to suffer the same diseases. She is at risk due to genetics but because you're knowledgeable you'll know to look for the warning signs and know to get her help should she need it. My parents were pretty perfect, I have always been unconditionally loved and supported, and I still ended up with bipolar and anxiety! So, don't freak out about screwing your kid up. A ton of therapists specialize in kids and can help her understand.",1
"Yes if its often enough the child us feeling fear and distress, then it absolutely is traumatizing her. But there are solutions and ways to repair things.",1
I have a 5 yr old and she kinda does the same thing and I hate to say it but I can scream at her and scare her but one day I sat her down and explained to her that mommy don't mean to scream at her like that my brain is messed up and I have to take medicine to help me be happy she kinda understands I think just kinda put it into words she will understand,1
See my kids know when I'm being serious and when I'm just being an irritable ass.,1
I think she is worried about the BPD as it is developed through truamtic childhood.... speak with your child there is no too young.,1
"I stress about stress before there's even stress to stress about, then I stress about stressing over stress that doesn't need to be stressed about, it's stressful. And that's how every day is for me . I hate mental illness",1
This is how I feel and wish I didn't have to go through this... I feel ashamed to be depressed sometimes.,1
This is very true. I also keep a lot of shit to myself because the ones that actually do give a fuck are far too precious to me to risk alienating them with my shit. I live them so much I think they deserve better than my shit so we concentrate on something else and their awesomeness makes me forget about my shit.,1
Yes I talk to one person about everything and then I feel guilty like why am I talking about myself I shouldn't have said anything no one cares they think I'm stupid and then I just want to curl up and cry as my heart starts to sink. Xo,1
"Story of my life.. I'm done telling ppl about my pain hurt  sadness despair  and sorrow I feel inside ..nobody understands or takes me seriously ... I always say suicide is my only option and I mean it..  feel so lonely and lost. Broken and alone .. nothing to live for .. feel like a worthless failure. Feel totally hopeless   .. can't deal with my intense depression and anxiety .. feel like I'm in a nightmare ,.  I know nobody cares so I keep so much inside and  I hate it..  need to let it out. Tired of holding it in.. can't pretend to be happy .. cAnt be strong anymore. ReAdy to give up",1
"It's the state you get yourself into that makes you want to do it then it's the feeling that you become addicted to. This is why the temptation is always there. 
I recently told my psych that if they could create a pill that gives you the same feeling as when I've self harmed (cut) I'd be fixed!
Of course that's not true but it just proves what a desperate state you find yourself in to want to harm yourself in order to feel better.
I have resisted the temptation & not harmed myself for 2 months now & whenever I feel that temptation creeping in, I call my best friend who knows how to talk me down.",1
"See, this is exactly what I'd love to be able to do but my husband hates tattoos! 
I did go ahead & get one (by my brother) on my foot/ankle/just above ankle area once though, without saying anything. There are so many great ideas I have thought of but I doubt I'll ever be able to do it as they're grand ideas!",1
It's a every day struggle,1
I wish you strength on your journey. I struggle with bipolar II and anxiety disorder and am 34weeks pregnant my baby has been my strength and reason to stay well nd fight thru the thoughts.,1
"I have mood disorder , ptsd.manic depression , anxiety and panic disorder since I was really young I have a great therapist and psychiatrist but I am struggle still I think about harming myself a lot I been group therapy and inpatient will be doing soon I wake everyday and tell myself everything is ok",1
I go through it when I am overwhelmed,1
"I fight everyday!!! But I win at the of it...cause I'm still here,It's a struggle but refuse to let it beat me ...Only a few friends know my struggle but in some way don't understand...but try..    ",1
If only people knew the battle it is everyday to fight the anxiety to jump out of bed and smile when deep down your really struggling. Sometimes i feel best to pretend your over the top happy as it feels to me no one really cares. Hugs all.xoxo,1
"True.
Only two times I avoided a depression that was coming for me was being marched for miles along the road.
And having a bath and my toddler popped a whole bottle of lavender oil in my bath. It was very strong, but I did not want to waste it. It kept a depression away !!!",1
Yep my life in a nutshell .. I'm going thru this now and it's getting bad again.. don't want to get out of bed. Lost interest..  can't concentrate .. irritated all the time.. just want to cry  a lot,1
"Had a dream so vivid I snapped selling my place bought beach place moving back to family town although I'm up n down I've used some healing n help from family n psychologist n I'm movin on it's been really hard but I've got no options but to just try it ,,it feels exciting but overwhelming sometimes it's taken me 5yrs more I'm got energy n drive its positive so much gratitude for all this for me it's a frikken bout time I could not focus on much ✌️        ",1
"I left my job because I was just to tired in the morning,its not like I sleep late or sleep to little,even with 8 hours of sleep waking up for me is dreadful",1
This is so true.  I have been dreading mornings lately,1
Don't agree with this.  I went back to school at 50 which was scary but took it a day at a time & I graduated.  Your best is good enough!!!!,1
"I'm not terrified of it being a possibility, because I know it's true...",1
If you do you will never have learned from your struggles. It is through suffering that true happiness is found. Take it from me. I've been stable for 8 months. Never thought it possible to actually be happy. If you fight and not give up it can happen for you too. God bless you all.,1
I'm a mom of three with differing diagnoses. 1 no and1 anxiety disorder and 1 with borderline personality. I love all 3. I see their struggles. I would not trade my time with them for anything.,1
It's me too and I don't expect anyone to understand. I always feel guilty for feeling this way. But it's not my fault. It's a no win situation  ,1
They would be very concerned and frightened and surprised that my thoughts are so dark and negative   And deep and deppresing....,1
Omg      #shameless,1
horrible  siesa,1
This describe me .I struggle but never give up!,1
"If an incurable disease has invaded your life, refuse to let it touch your spirit. Your body can be severely afflicted, and you may have a great struggle. But if you keep trusting God's love, your spirit will remain strong.",1
so true for me .anxiety and worries are an all day thing with me,1
"That's me in a nutshell!!  It's scary and lonely.  I try to het out of it, you know, get outta my head, but somehow, I keep winding up right back in it.",1
Hi I don't know u but I totally understand and can relate ... this is the story of my life.. I totally get not being able to function .. can't function myself .. been struggling since high school with anxiety and depression  too . I'm also suicidal and a cutter . Have been for years..,1
"Oh my, your pain comes through, it is awful to hear the struggle you are experiencing.  It is clearly a half life you are living, well not really living, but merely existing if nothing now brings you pleasure.  Unfortunately it sounds very familiar, but it might not be any comfort to you that the feelings you are experiencing will resonate with so many people.
When you are going though such turmoil each day can be a nightmare.  Day after day, it is exhausting, debilitating and so dreadfully unbearable.  No wonder you have had these thoughts that you can't go on, you don't want to be here and just can't see anything ever improving.
It's a viscous cycle of ruminating, feeling alone, abandoned, desperate, constantly miserable and not being able to see an end to it all.
When you need the strength, drive and determination to beat this hideous illness, those are the things which you often don't have.
Please please don't give up hope.  Your family need you and want you.  You expressed that your friends don't understand, but you haven't really totally opened up to your family? Is this not something you could do, to try to explain how bad things really are? It is very often the case we push our families away for many reasons, but can they truly help and support if they don't really know?
Re the diagnosis, medical appointments and medication.  The recent diagnosis is only the beginning with regards to those issues, is there no ongoing support from those? I'm no expert, but diagnosis in itself is surely of little help if there is nothing provided on the back of that?
Forgive me as I assume you might be in the US and I'm in the Uk and clearly services are very different, but diagnosis alone could make things worse in the short term without the follow up support as it might just leave you with so many unanswered questions?
Again re the medical apps and medication, this all can be instrumental in providing a stable platform to build recovery.  If the meds aren't right, then it can be so much more difficult.  I often view medication as a necessary (in many cases) crutch to provide the stability to move forward.  You explained these appointments are expensive, but what is the potential cost to you, your family and your daughter if they are not working?
Once the medication is right, the appointments then can hopefully lessen.
I really understand your pain having suffered previously for so long, but I also know unfortunately the pain and carnage a suicide leaves behind.  When you are in the middle of the quagmire of severe depression, we don't always rationally view everything.  So much can get obscured and we can make some terrible decisions.
My psychiatrist warned me against making any big decisions while I was suffering as we view the world very differently.  I put no more thought into buying a house than a loaf of bread. Nothing had any meaning.  It is so hard to see the wood for the trees (apologies for my English metaphors!) 
I've seen both sides I guess.  I know all too well the effect a suicide has on those close loved ones for a lifetime, your parents and your daughter of course don't want to have to live with that.  I'm sure they all love you very much and would want to do all they could to help if they really could understand your pain.
I'm so sorry to run on and I also know it is far from easy, but in short in the grand scheme of things I guess the cost of the appointments and the potential happy life you could have is worth the money.
There is a real chance of having a better future, a chance to be happy.
Post depression for me is the start of my new life.  My depression (well the last big one) was my previous life.
Small, achievable steps are possible, but you need support and love, care, compassion.  Be kind to yourself, you deserve to beat this, you all deserve a better life.  Best wishes, thinking of you x",1
Ur not alone try stay strong be there heaps of time & it's a bloody horrible feeling u have a very good reason 2 live ur daughter cause every child needs their mum & thanx 2 my daughter i've stop cutting & overdosing  so plz 4 ur daughter's sake hold on stay strong,1
Don't worry you are not the only one going through this all my family does is being me down and husband is worse on Friday after sleeping for a week I tryed to see how I can hang myself but I said to myself I am better than this I have to be strong and bring myself up and if you need a friend you have one here anytime.   ,1
U need to relax. Try rest have a massage. If it continues see a doctor better that than it getting worse.  Say you having trouble sleeping and relaxing. Quetiapine was v gd even in a small dose to be able to rest. I tuk this after childbirth. Ask bout this. What meds are you on. Don't worry sometimes it feels as if it's too much and when u can't sleep you think it's Gona go into a relapse. This happened many times to me. It doesn't. Stop worrying try rest / put bad thoughts to one side,1
All i could say is i feel your pain i am bipolar and general anxiety disorder and depression iv suffering a lot lately my doctor just switched too im not use to my new doctor yet and he took me off my old meds ativan and oxycarbozapine i know ativan is addicting but it worked my anxiety is to bad with out it im now taking seraqual for sleep it makes me sleep nbut with side affects light headed dizzy and nauses and clonzapin for anxiety does not help to well hopefully he gets to no me and knows i dont abuse meds just take as needed and he will put me back on my old meds so i can feel better take care and hang in there,1
Although it's difficult for you with all the life stressors all at once you have to believe that everything changes . It will pass as it has before. Stay strong. Hope a little peace comes your way soon. Xx,1
Praying for and all of us. It's scary especially when you're not on meds because of financial reasons or they don't believe you!,1
"The good thing is... you have survived through the darkness before... now you're even stronger enough to get through this too... I understand how hard it can be to be overwhelmed with too much emotions, hold on tight and dont let it win over you...",1
"Sometimes i get so tired. It can be a daily struggle. I have good days, i never seem to be at my full potential.",1
my mother is I have a cousin who is as well I was diagnosed with mdd major depressive disorder and anxiety but always wondered myself but also can't stand labels am who I am try not to let it define me as a person I would say my depression has severely gotten worse since my grandfather died in 2008 not only was he a grandfather he was like a dad I never had and a best friend all in one to this day I still have hard time getting through it and going on without him he was one of the very few relatives I was close to and seemed to genuinely care about me,1
Yes!  My father had manic depression. In the 50's diagnosis and treatment was little. He had no treatment and unfortunately turned to alcohol. He went out and robbed a bank in a manic state. Got 10 years. He committed suicide when I was 15. My mother had anxiety and depression. Tracing back to my family there were quite a few cases aswell. I was diagnosed 12 years ago and after a few hospital stays I gratefully got the treatment I needed. My daughter has inherited bipolar and is also under good care and treatment. My phyciatrist is convinced it runs in families.,1
"Nature/nurture? I can`t get a straight answer. There is a gene associated with bipolar (bp1 I know, so I assume bp2, too) If you have this gene, it`s easily triggered. Some people without this gene can be thrown into mh issues if truama is severe enough. I worry about my girls. But (!) I know to watch for signs so I can catch it early & get them into treatment. I`m always aware they are watching me & it helps me stick to my treatment plan. I want them to see me be responsable about it so if they ever have to they will know how.",1
I dont know about bipolar 2 but bipolar 1 is genetic and is usually brought out by either trauma or by your early 20s. It is possible to pass it down if you are a carrier. That is why I am scared of having a second child it sucks,1
"My son had the genetic components but trauma  (both physically as a baby from being very sick and mentally-really showed up after horrible bullying) increased and intensified.  His doctor's (neurologist, genetics and physciatrist) have told us he likely would have had some sort of anxiety/depression but the traumas brought it on younger and more intense. Definitely can be a combination of the two.",1
"Yes it is genetic but can also be triggered I also had trauma and was mis diagnosed with normal depression, you don't have to have trauma to have it but that can trigger your bipolar, it doesn't mean it will be passed down to your children it can skip generations, I was worried about my kids but worry is just part of us anyway I'm open and honest to my kids about it so they understand it a bit more too, hope this helps x",1
"First off I want to admit I'm not a Doctor and I'm ignorant.OK? Why can't it be both? People having had trauma having babies and raising them will not be perfect, or any person for that matter. Wouldn't their children be more susceptible genetically through trauma to be diagnosed. Don't make it more complicated than it needs to be. They're/you are hurt and need help...end of the story. The question is irrelevant....just more anxiety.",1
This is true. My son had the genetic components but trauma  (both physically as a baby from being very sick and mentally-really showed up after horrible bullying) increased and intensified.  His doctor's have told us he likely would have had some sort of anxiety/depression but the traumas brought it on younger and more intense. Definitely can be a combination   ,1
"I am 55 years old and both my children have high functioning depression.
I have thirteen siblings.
We suspect at least two have bi polar or depression. We have lost contact with them.
My 12 year old neice has depression and anxiety.",1
"I believe it can be genetic it also can have nothing to do with genes. Genes only make part of your brain and generally how it works, some of it is highly affected by the outer world and circumstances. I know my father was likely bipolar and had a lot of the other diagnosis I have. My mother has chronic situational depression (it's easily triggered and close to being clinical she just doesn't talk about shit so I think if she did it would be considered clinical). My brother has severe anxiety and OCD, and depression can be easily triggered for him. I know later down our family line we likely have far more mental illnesses that aren't mentioned at all. But I know because I leaned so strongly towards my bipolar genes that I showed symptoms around 9 and got diagnosed officially at 13 which is practically unheard of (especially 12 years back). But it was obvious what the signs were. Most children under 16 aren't ever diagnosed. I was diagnosed at 11 with depression and put on useless (for me) and low dose anti-depressants. At nine I was showing symptoms, but easily lied about it and covered it up, I have been doing ever since. It's become a habit and people ask me why I do it? And it's like... I don't remember how not to?

So it honestly depends. Sometimes we are just dealt crap hands, sometimes it's passed down, but it's always hell and it makes us stronger than anyone can ever understand.",1
Bipolar is not traumatic disorder. But truama can be a risk factor.,1
"There's some genetic components but I've watched documentaries and read books where they explain that people with the genetics can be non bipolar, the gene can lie dormant in you and trauma or stress can trigger it.",1
"Also, I'd research that 30% thing. That sounds like a random bs number. It's a crap shoot if your kids get it. And I've always been told you're at a higher risk of getting it if it runs in your family, so I'd say that's prob higher than 30%. I may very much be wrong but I don't think they really know.",1
I stopped my meds as soon as i found out i was pregnant but was contiously advised by psychiatrist and consultant to go back on mirtazapine. I managed to stay off them until i was 22 weeks but i had to go back on them. Started at 15mg and built up to 45mg. I really think i would have been in a really bad way post natal if i hadnt started back on them. I was assured first trimester was the riskiest for meds xx,1
"I was on Bupropion, Seroquel, Hydroxyzine and Lamotrigene while I was pregnant. Doctors wanted to taper and take me off of the Seroquel because there was a risk of my daughter going into withdrawals. I was unable to decrease let alone discontinue it, but when she was born she had no side effects whatsoever. I know there are risks taking any medication during pregnancy but the benefits vastly outweighed the negatives. My daughter is fine and my postpartum under control. But whatever you feel is right for you and your baby is what you should do.",1
"Hello I am almost 9 months pregnant and I remained on wellbrutin 200mg I used to be on lithium and wellbrutin 400 mg. I went to a high risk dr who specializes in these case , saw my therapist and my psych dr !!! I have had some bad low spots but I am very lucky that I am aware of it and I speak up right away and head straight to therapy ! I am also very lucky I have a great support system . I am nervous about when the baby comes out because I wanna breastfeed and I am not sure I can . But my mental health comes first",1
"Admitted to myself that I had a problem in my 3rd trimester of my second pregnancy and my doctor prescribed zoloft. I had much better days. No problems, withdrawls, or defects with my little one. Breastfeeding was not a problem either. I wasn't diagnosed as bipolar 2 until a few months ago so idk how other meds may affect pregnancy. Your doctor will weigh the risks and benifits. Hope this helps ❤",1
"Hi, and congratulations!  My daughter is now 15 so I don't remember what I was on, but whatever they were, all the docs all agreed they were safe during pregnancy but not safe enough for breastfeeding.  That was sad for me but there is so much more to that little life, you'll soon forget that part.
My daughter was born extremely healthy, but, because of genetics, just bc keep an eye/ear out for any signs of dpression, anxiety, bipolar (I'm sorry; I forget what you said you have.). And if/when you notice anything, get he/she help as soon as possible.  
I had my daughter in to a therapist at age 5.  Like I said, 15 now, and still seeing someone, and just this past week, started Celexa for anxiety and depression.  
I am SO SO SO sorry for the long message.  Good luck!",1
"If you're bipolar 1,antidepressants will send you into a suicidal state of mind, just be aware of that. Also research has proven that there is a higher probability that ssri's and antipsychotic meds will effect your baby. It's a risk.",1
"Zoloft/sertraline is one of the safest meds to be on during pregnancy. I went back on it toward the end of my second pregnancy because my anxiety was getting bad again. I was also very concerned about my baby having withdrawals, etc. I seem to remember my dr telling me anything under 100mg was negligible, and the babies she HAD seen go through withdrawal after birth cried more for a day or two and then were fine. 
Breastfeeding wasn't an issue for me on the sertraline (off name for Zoloft) I also breastfeed on psych meds with my first (cipralex) and everything was fine too. Again, Zoloft is one of the safest meds for pregnancy/breastfeeding. 
Something I want you to know before this baby comes: Your cup NEEDS to be full in order to pour into others' (your baby's) lives. I have gone way too long trying to fill my family up from an empty cup and it does not work. Your health needs to come as a priority so that you can be as happy and healthy a mama as you can be. 
Good luck, hun.   ",1
My doctors told me they wouldnt put me on meds when i was pregnant because the child could have withdrawls doc only gave me visterail to help my anxiety it didnt work just hang in there.,1
"*offers hugs* if you were doing okay on your meds before you became pregnant I don't think you should worry too much about changing them until a few months after the baby comes... let's not forget that with pregnancy comes massive shifts in your bodies hormones that could easily account for the increase in bad days, after your hormonal levels have returned to a somewhat normal rate, then would be a good time to reassess your medication   ",1
"I didn't. I had a miserable pregnancy and after got nasty postpartum depression which my family took advantage of  and my aunt now has adopted my daughter cuz that's what they convinced me to do. Moral of the story...if u can find a medications that works for u and is safe for the baby, TAKE IT!",1
"If you're bipolar the Zoloft won't help it'll only hurt. And I would suggest seeing a psychiatrist especially being pregnant. Medications are dangerous. I understand treatment is crucial as I'm bipolar 2 with mixed features and severe anxiety. I had to quit my treatment while pregnant and it was awful. I wish you the best of luck mama, no matter the direction you have to turn. And congratulations!",1
"I'm bipolar 2 and have a 20 week old baby.
When I fell pregnant I went to see my dr to talk about my med, We had a really good chat and spoke about the risks.
I already had 2 children that needed me so I decided to continue to take my med!
God for 5mths my mood was really not good I nearly got taken into hospital.
Now 20 weeks on I'm so glad I stayed on my med,my little girl was fine there wasn't any problems with her at all.
I'm on 250mg quetiapine
And 100mg Sertraline.
No-one can make your mind up but you. They are risks with all med.

"In the UK they like to put you on Sertraline for depression when you find out you're pregnant as it has the least possible risks for baby during pregnancy and breastfeeding...I was moved to it last year as my husband and I wanted to start trying for a baby. By the time I fell pregnant this spring I was on 150mg per day, decided to move down to 100mg as I felt well enough to do so but have the option to go back up if I really need to x",1
Rest esp after childbirth v imp. A good care plan. I had epidural to reduce stress / pain and risk of relapse. Think that helped a lot . You need help with baby after delivery. Hospital should keep you in longer than normal and ask nurses to help at night. Or ur midwife can maybe. Medication is v imp after birth. I tuk lithium and quetiapine to help relax. That helped a lot. Sleep v imp. But maybe ur diagnosis is different may need different meds. But this helped me stay well. Ask someone to help with night feeds after and don't take on too much. Get help if you notice any symptoms,1
"Zoloft made me have suicidal thoughts and actions. My doctor stopped it right away and I felt better almost immediately. Maybe talk to your doctor about stopping it? From what I've heard from some psychiatrists, most individuals with bipolar disorder should not be put on antidepressants because they could make mania worse or trigger lowest of lows. But hey I'm not a doctor that is just what I've hear from doctors whilst in treatment centers. Also I don't know exactly what YOUR bipolar disorder experience is like. It's different for all of us. Right now you have two people to think about your unborn child, which God bless him or her needs to be taken care of before and after birth and then there is you, the primary part of the puzzle. I say the primary part because without you being in right mind mentally it will affect you physically which in turn will God forbid affect that beautiful child. As I write this I am trying to hold back tears because although I am not a mother I one day want to be one and what you are now going through I fear I will with my countless amounts of medications and questioning each day if I will be mentally stable enough or if my baby will be affect if I take meds. But what you need to have right now and what I'll need to have in the future is faith. Yes talk to your doctor about possibly getting off the Zoloft because maybe it's causing those bad thoughts and do the technical psychiatric part of the process but like they say there is science and then there is God. I encourage you, if you are a praying woman, to pray on it especially when you get those thoughts. He will listen. Do it for you. Do it for that blessed child. All will be alright I promise you. May God bless you both and your family. Take care love.❤️      ",1
"If taking a medication improves the quality of your life and sanity, then you should take it. Especially with a low dosage you would be recommended to take. Most Drs are against medications during pregnancy especially for mental issues.  They look at a chart and immediately insist it is a terrible idea. If you or your doctor have any concerns, a specialist will be likely recommended. They have trained staff that measure and track all growth, fluids, etc regularly.  I lowered my dosages of some of my medications and immediately resumed the normal level after my child was born. My child was healthy and I was better able to take care of her.  Benefit vs risk.  If you are able to deal with your illness without medication, then obviously do it.  But you do not have to suffer unnecessarily because of pressure or fear.  Your child will not have withdrawals or lasting impacts from that - but the rammifications of discontinuing a medication pregnant can effect your ability to adequately care for and bond with your baby.  It isn't noble or more responsible or more natural or whatever kind of misinformation will say, to suffer.",1
"When I decided I wanted to get pregnant, I weaned myself off my antidepressant first. I didn't risk it.",1
"I can't remember what I took but my kids were both fine.  I went off to breastfeed but couldn't do it. I was so full of anxiety. I stopped breastfeeding and went back on meds 
Good luck. You got this",1
"In health care there is adage ""When the benefits outweigh the risks; the risks are worth taking."" Only YOU can decide. Personally, I would take the medication. Yes, the baby might have health issues but YOU WILL be there to take care of your bundle of JOY. God Bless and good luck!",1
"I was on Lamictal for my bipolar when I was pregnant.. My son cam out perfectly healthy, but here's the thing.. My doctor gave me a choice and said my son could come out with a cleft lip.. so I went to an herbal drug store and started taking fish oil as it helps skin to grow and stay healthy and I also took omega3 for his brain activity and a few other herbal pills.. If you are unsure about your medications I would suggest taking over the counter pills like the fish oil and vitamin B helps with your moods too. Of course, being bipolar and having depression, it won't do as much as your meds will but maybe try n stay at the same dose and add vitamin B to it? Best of luck to You and your little one!",1
I stop my medications as soon i found out i was pregant i didn't want to risk it & i just increased my therapy sessions,1
"The only medicine I could take when I was pregnant was latuda and buspar. Neither did me any good. I started before I was stayed on during, miscarried my child still stayed on them and ended up in the hospital to be put on other meds. I have bipolar, anxiety, PTSD, and OCD, and adhd tendencies by whatever tests that they put me through. I'm not on generic topimax, cymbalta, trazidone, and have to go to talk therapy every week and meet with psychiatrist every 4 weeks. So??? Depends on each person's individual chemistry to be honest. And if you have any other health conditions as well.",1
"I was on Zoloft most pregnancy with both of my boys.  They started me at 25 mg both times. My last pregnancy, I was at 100 mg by the time I gave birth. Neither boys had any side effects. The only side effect my OB was worried about for baby was irritability for my son (had two different docs with my boys) after he was born. Neither of my boys had irritability. I also breastfed both boys.  My oldest is ADHD and has anxiety, but there is a ton of mental illnesses on both sides. 
I have bipolar disorder, GAD, ADHD, and PTSD.  Zoloft didn't work the greatest, but it certainly helped take the edge off. It is one of those things where you weigh risks to benefits.  I would do your research before you start a medication. Check the studies done on the medication.  Yes, you do need to think of baby first, but stress isn't good on the baby either.  Stress can have side effects on the baby too.   From short to long term effects. 

If you do take a SSRI, be sure to watch out for mania/hypermania.  Being on only an SSRI can cause bouts of mania. I am a type 1, but I didn't really have issues during pregnancy. 

Do what is best for you and baby. Whatever you decide is something that should be respected. You're a wonderful mother.  Everyone is different and deals with their mental illness differently.",1
"I took a low dose of celexa and everything was fine. You have to be in a good state of mind! I think a low dose is fine. You don't want to be miserable or stress the baby out with depression which can lead into worse things such as not eating and panic attacks, increased heart rate or dehydration. Sometimes the benefits of the medicine outweigh the risks. If u need the medicine and it's a small dose like it is, I say it's fine!",1
Effexor the last trimester and for 2 years nursing......325 mg he is fine and 13 now.......he didn't have any ADHD or any other disorder. the hormones really make depression and anxiety hard. With my first I went free of medication but for my second baby I chose medication. I was able to have some control over my depression and be more calm and present for my baby.,1
"I didn't take any meds while pregnant, it's 100% safer, no worries about birth defects or anything for my babies.",1
"Agreed! Some people are so judgemental! I was on a low dose of celexa and everything was fine, sometimes the benefits of the medicine outweigh the risks. I mean it's be different if it was a class C medicine but she is on a low dose.",1
"I was on 100 mg of zoloft while pregnant. Its perfectly safe. And ask for Latuda. Its a medicine used to treat bipolar and its safe for pregnant and nursing mothers. Was pregnant with my son on both and nursed him on both. They would want to reduce the zoloft at maybe 37 weeks so that your baby doesnt suffer from withdrawal. He might be extra sleepy or fussy or a bit shaky as a result. Im actually pregnant right now too. Almost 5 months. My psychiatrist has me on haldol. Its low risk for pregnancy. It makes me really sleepy, but i have almost no meltdowns anymore. Its the best medicine I've ever been on. Good luck, Mama. And hugs!!! :)",1
I'm currently 7 weeks pregnant and I stopped taking my Zoloft. I am struggling with my depression but I am trying to work through it. I don't want to cause my baby any damage.,1
I took Latuda and Buspar with my last pregnancy for bi-polar and anxiety. Latuda worked great but after I had my baby I started having a reaction to it. This is my 2nd pregnancy and am only on Buspar. The other med. Lamictal which is okay for pregnancy I have a reaction to as well. I do go to group 3 times a weel as well. Good luck,1
Before I became pregnant I went to see a reproductive toxicologist because I was on Effexor and didn't want any adverse affects to the baby. He said that SSRI's and SSNRI's cause no more damage than the 3% chance of any birth defect in a normal pregnancy. My son had no withdrawal symptoms and received my breast milk for seven months that had my medication in it as well. Mood stabilizers like Depakote can cause birth defects. MAOI's can cause birth defects as well as anti psychotics. You should not worry about Zoloft. The doctor said to me that it's important to have a healthy mother. You need to be eating and sleeping.  Being suicidal is not healthy for a pregnancy. Be safe and be well and may you have a healthy baby.,1
ive been trying to conceive for ages now. im on zolfot 100mg and quitiapal 100mg at night and 25mg when required... am i going to continue to struggle because of my meds????,1
"I can't take antidepressants at all. I have epilepsy so there are very few meds I can take. But I'm on buspar for my anxiety and lamotragine for my bipolar. I am also 9 months pregnant with my 4th kid. Being pregnant with all these problems is probably one of the worst feelings in the world. You have your moments of happiness then severe depression for longer than the ups. You have to fight each day to get through it. I'm probably one of the few people on here who can't take anything really. Get yourself a strong circle of friends. Try working on new things to keep yourself busy. Worst case scenario try looking into more home remedies. Natural things like aromatherapy, healing stones and crystals, herbal teas, stuff like that. Its working for me.",1
Depends on if the benefits outweigh the risks. In my case they do.,1
"I'm bipolar 2 and I can't stop my meds so I have to accept that I won't have a second child. Anyway, I just have to remember my last pregnancy and the first years of my son's life and I think it's better this way. I dont't want that my son suffer from ny illness (depression, high, anxiety, etc...). I'm not a doctor but my psychiatrist always told be that you can't take any meds when your pregnant. I don't think you should take that risk..  Good luck!",1
Studies show children of women who suffered from depression (part of bipolar) during pregnancy are at risk for learning disabilities and mental health issues.,1
This is what I've done with all three pregnancies. I stop my meds cry all the time and try to deal with it. Then once baby is born go back on medication. I'd hate to risk unintentionally​ hurting my baby by taking an antidepressant.,1
"I am bipolar 2 and a therapist, currently on Zoloft. Although you may continue with it throughout pregnancy, remember that stress can also affect your pregnancy. You need to be in the best state of mind for your baby. Try some yoga and definitely seeing a therapist regularly. There are apps you could download like Happify or Fabulous. Even reaching out just like you did now is important. Keep you and your baby safe. Ask your doctor about natural alternatives. Whole foods has some I believe.",1
"Wow, Rachel!  It is good to listen to your doctors as the meds you were on might not have been ok while pregnant.  However to call the rest of us ""dumb fucks"" is out of line. We all weighed the risk of our meds against the risk to the baby's development. There are meds your doctor could have switched you to that were safer. Telling someone to go unmedicated is like telling them it is ok to feel uncontrolled suicidal thoughts, which puts them at a higher risk of death. That it is never ok!  We moms that took medication while pregnant and while nursing were putting our child's life first and ours to be able to be there for our child. There are no ""dumb fucks"" here, only educated moms.",1
Well I'll listen to my Drs they know more than any of you I've researched which are safe and which aren't so to all of you on meds whilst pregnant I hope your happy with yourselves for putting your children at risks you stupid fucks,1
"Lithium isn't safe! My Dr refused to use lithium while I was pregnant because of too many risks, said if I wanted to go that direction I have to sign a waiver stating I know the risks, because that's not something he practices. I couldn't do it. I understand being stable trust me, it's an everyday battle for everyone. But never in a million years would I stay on treatment and risk the life of my child. It's a small window of time to not be on meds, with the right support, you can get through without meds. You just have to know what support you really need. And different meds do different things during different phases of pregnancy. I've been on some that are safer after first trimester and I've been on some that were only safe during the first trimester.",1
Sometimes ppl need to be on medication and that is less risky often than having a relapse. Lithium safe after 26wks and other meds have a low risk of problem. It's 1st trimester when it's imp to be off meds IF possible/ advised. Although I was ok with out any,1
I didn't even know it was thought to be ok to continue psych meds while pregnant. So when I decided to get pregnant I weaned myself off before I even started trying. I wasn't going to risk something going wrong with my baby because of my meds.,1
"Fortunately,  I wasn't on meds when I was pregnant.   I battle my disorders in silence.  I don't know if I am worth listening to, but, if you can hold off increasing the meds, I think you should.  I know what your going thru to some degree.  And it's definitely tough.  I have many disorders, including bipolar.   There are many side affects that affect us, let alone a baby.  I believe the meds could have some affect.  It would scare me.  I hope you find peace in whatever you do.  My prayers are with you.  GOD BLESS!!",1
I stopped all meds when I was pregnant. Then continued them after I had baby. So I was not able to breastfeed. And things were hard during my pregnancy but to me the bad days were worth knowing that I was doing what was best for my kids and not taking chances. I understand why some women opt to stay on meds but for me it just wasn't a risk I was willing to take. And while I had suicidal thoughts I knew that I never would act on them while I was pregnant. So I just dealt with everything until baby was born and continued therapy.,1
"I was on pristiq for depression/anxiety my entire pregnancy and ended up going UP dosage to 200mg/day. The only issues bubba would have faced was possibly some lung issues but as long as they were aware of it they would be prepared to handle it. he was born via c section 2 weeks early as he was 4.4kg/10p12.5o and I had a lot of fluid. the biggest risk to his health was actually my gestational diabetes not my meds. I was told that I would be able to breastfeed and stay on my meds and that would actually be beneficial to bubba as would reduce his withdrawal symptoms. I made the decision myself to bottle feed. I did try breast feeding initially but I think c section and being separated from him while he was in special care for 9 days didn't help. while a small part of me missed BF,  you still get the closeness and contact while bottle feeding and it also allows your partner to have a hand in it too :) please talk to your gp/psych/obstetrics Dr about possible side effects for you and bubba. my Drs keep talking about good outweighing risks. at the end of the day it is how you feel too. if you feel the anxiety of being on meds and possible risks will be worse for you than tell your Drs that. 

here if you need it Mumma!",1
"So you believe pregnant mothers who choose to take their doctors advice & stay on the minimum dose of meds that SCIENCE & RESEARCH HAS DEEMED SAFE TO USE, will still have babies that are more likely to develop those disorders you mention? 

That's funny because I didn't drink any alcohol, smoke, take meds, eat shellfish, certain cheeses, cuts of meats etc etc etc, (whatever was popular at the time to 'not do' & still constantly changes today). During all 3 of my pregnancies, yet my 2 boys are both diagnosed with ASD (Autism spectrum disorder), ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) & GAD (Generalised anxiety disorder) & my daughter was diagnosed with ADD (Attention deficit disorder). 

So there you go, even mothers who think they've done everything right, still have special needs children!
Your ignorance is obviously bliss for you, but for those, who through no fault of their own, are still giving birth to & raising special needs children, it's not so blissful. 

Want to know the actual truth? 
EVEN SCIENCE DOESN'T KNOW HOW OR CAN EXPLAIN WHAT CAUSES SUCH DISORDERS!! 

So how can you think you have any idea?!!",1
Studies show children of women who suffered from depression (part of bipolar) during pregnancy are at risk for learning disabilities and mental health issues.,1
"I was on 100 mg of Zoloft my whole pregnancy, I had a lot more appointments/ ultrasounds just to keep an eye out for anything bad(which I was fine). I'm also bipolar, I cold turkey my Xanax though (bc im diagnosed with anxiety) which was difficult but I was fine on my Zoloft and they paid a lot of attention to me being pregnant on it. As for the breast feeding I couldn't produce milk so I can't help you on that topic.",1
"Amanda, ANY baby can show those signs as each and every baby is as singular and individual as adults are. 

Research the hell out of the subject. Speak to multiple doctors, specialists, and make sure that you see a psychiatrist as opposed to a psychologist regarding medications - they are the ones who are trained in that area. Make sure that you KNOW what can happen, what a ""safe"" dose during pregnancy is, and how to handle/what to do IF your baby does have withdrawals, etc. Though, realistically, if your baby is having withdrawals he/she will be staying in the hospital so that it can be managed in a safe and non-life threatening way.

Just because someone else who has taken didn't have any issues, it doesn't mean that you won't, and vice versa.

Only YOU know what is best for you and your baby, however, if you are having suicidal thoughts I would be inclined to stay on the Zoloft, and to increase as your psych deems fit.
You will have a whole team of doctors, psych, OBGYN's, and perinatal/postnatal specialists looking after both you and your baby (pre and post birth), to ensure both of your safety and needs are taken care of.

Have an IN-DEPTH discussion with your psych - write out any and all questions that you have before your next appointment, and take that list with you so that you may address your concerns properly.

Good luck sweetheart! ❤️xxx",1
"I was worried. When I first found out I quit Zoloft cold turkey too and they made me go back on it, they told me that's the first thing they normally put pregnant women on.. like I said they watched over me and I had a lot more appointments but she came out happy and healthy!!",1
Eletric Shock Therapy.   It used to be popular till we finally got some effective drugs. You lose some of your memory when they do it.  I talked to patients who underwent it when I was considering it. I decided the risk was too great. Instead I flew from WA to CA to enter a hospital just for mental health. There are a ton of facilities for alcoholics and drug abusers and not enough for mental health.,1
I'm Biploar 2 & I wouldn't touch psych meds while I was pregnant or breastfeeding. I have a friend who is Bipolar 1 & she had to come off meds under Dr's supervision with every pregnancy & just risk the moods. She was advised to bottle feed in order to get back on her meds asap. Keep researching. These are serious meds.   ,1
"I'm taking 50mg of Zoloft but I tried my hardest and waited until I was in the middle of my 2nd trimester where all his major organs were developed already ..it was really hard during the time I was off all medications but for me the benefits outweighed the risks, sometimes it can do more damage if you are anxious and depressed 
Best of luck xx",1
Your not crazy at all infact you seem quite strong you no what's wrong and you want help to support you that's a strength my sweet you sound very much like me I have just got off pregabaling which makes my speech impaired n I can't hold a sentence at all n my friends and family look at me like I'm an idiot not thinking it's just the meds but if truth be told it's crippling me not having it right now I struggle every day waking up to crippling anxiety I swapped a med sertraline for esetalopram and it worked wonders but I'm struggling again just keep fighting for what you need n don't stop till you get it stay safe   ,1
You don't sound crazy at all. Don't worry about sounding crazy.,1
Do you suffer from an anxiety disorder? I ask because if it a social thing then just remember to breathe and believe that yourself is good enough. If you get panic attacks and such then u may want a low dose of an anxiety med but talk to your doctor about it if you have one and make sure not to mix with alcohol im always preached. I suffer from anxiety and take 1mg of klonopin (i believe thats a low dose) good luck,1

"I've recently come home from 2 weeks in a psych hospital. Not a nice one, but a Super-Max-type locked-down place with no. civil. rights.  You need it? you can't have it, cause somebody's figured out how to turn it into a weapon, or drugs. I have PTSD, Night Terrors, and Anxiey and Depression. They had to let me go before I was ready, because a woman was trying to kill me, and my pulse was so high, they were afraid I would have a stroke. Why didn't they put her in a locked room? Well, because SHE had a right to be there. So, I am home, withdrawing from Effexor. I only took it for 3 weeks, before the edema, hair loss, vision changes, heart rate changes, etc. till they believed me that it WAS killing me.",1
"Everyday, every hour is a struggle... Those who don't understand, won't unless they try and educate themselves on the illness. You think I, we, want to be this way?

"Most people ARE stupid. Most meople will NEVER get it, because they don't want to. They have their heads buried, because they are afraid.",1
Thanks for asking .. can't even describe   How intense my depression and anxiety and self hate is.. so very very strong .. very overwhelming .. still feel suicidal and hopeless. Still feel like giving up... no matter how I try things won't get better.. I feel like no one understands .. I can't be strong forever.. the pain hurt and sadness and sorrow and despair is  so much to handle .. unfortunately I have not had any improvement in how I feel.. I wish I did.. thanks a lot for checking in. It means a lot that someone cares,1
It's definitely a struggle that other ppl will never understand,1
It's a battle I fight daily.  And people that don't have these disorders can't really understand.  It's a very scary and lonely place to be.,1

I can totally empathise it is heartbreaking seeing your child really struggling with life. The only advice I can offer is no matter what make sure your lecturer in son knows you love and support him and will be there for him no matter what which is easy to day but not always easy to do. My son went through extreme periods of aggression verbal and physical and said some incredibly  hurtful things which i really struggled with but I tried to remember it wasnt him. Things are much better now but I still look out for the tell tale signs. Its vital that  you have good support too.,1
"I have Bipolar, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and ADHD. I was diagnosed when I was 23 yrs old I'm 46 now. First idk who is saying smoke weed but grow up! Second go for a walk I believe that's the most relaxing and calming for me. No one is the same so try anything that takes your mind off things Idc what it is writing, drawing working gardening etc I think you get the idea. I actually went thru a period of my younger life idk how old you are but again everyone is different. Mine was severe anxiety and depression and the ADHD had a role also. If you're just starting these symptoms now but I doubt it because I knew at age of 9 or 10 something wasn't right. Whatever happens at Dr be honest that's the only way the doc can help. If meds are prescribed take them some take a couple weeks to kick in others take 3-4 wks. Also if u have bad reactions and are worse or a reaction happens immediately tell doc. I'm going to let you know you might not like this Dr and he/she might dope u up. I went thru literally up-to this day 32 Dr's. Took  7 years to get my right combo. It's going to-be tough but hang in there. To this day even with meds I still have episodes. Very far between tho. Meds aren't a cure they're a part of your coping skills. They are not, ARE NOT A CURE! When you find out what is actually going on do what you're supposed to do and keep doing it. This also important you can't be comfortable with the Dr get a new one you must be able to not be afraid to tell all. That Dr says no your ok time to get a new one. If that Dr says same maybe it's something hormonal.  Men get unbalanced also. Stay away from. Alcohol drugs etc. They aren't helping they'll make it worse. God bless you  and I know you'll find that inner peace. #LiveLoveLaugh",1
"Sue you're exactly right. This is why I say read up and get knowledge! Jay and Eric both need more knowledge on this. THC is a good pain releaver and is proven. Weed is proven to cause anxiety,  paranoia and depression get your facts correct and until you both show me evidence from a source stop giving advice obviously you both know nothing about!",1
No read about it and weed causes in some paranoia and anxiety. Stop saying this I'm not trying to be a ass but stop. Ty,1
See a psychiatrist and try to get to the core of your anxiety. She will probably want to see you regularly and prescribe anti anxiety meds.,1
"This is a symptom of anxiety, refer to ""the book"" DSM-5. Talk it over with your health professional.",1
OMG this has been happening to me too! My Dr thought it was part of the anxiety and then it got worse and I was diagnosed with esophagitis,1
"I have the same problem when I'm having an anxiety attack. I go through the motions of throwing up. Usually nothing comes up unless I just ate. I'm finally on Clonidine, Klonopin, and Atarax. Haven't had an episode since. I have felt like I was going to have an anxiety attack. I stave it off by lying down or talking myself through it or go to the bathroom and wait it out.",1
I also do the gagging and throwing up when I have anxiety I try to ground myself and think of the positive stop it you're in my thoughts and prayers hugs peace ✌️,1
I had an issue with gagging/dry heaving. I dont think it had to do with my anxiety though. I just had a habit of making sure I always ate in the morning before takin my meds (lithium) so it wouldnt hurt my stomach as the few times I did make that mistake it wasnt a fun morning for me. I think my body just kinda associated me not eating in the morning with my experience of takin meds without food and triggered a response even though I didnt actually take my meds. Never happens after I eat a good meal in the morning,1
could be meds or from anxiety. Try supplements that help calm like ashwaghanda,1
I have the same problems im thinking its worse when anxiety is high and meds im taking seraquel it seems to be making me sick with nausea and light headed and dizzyness gonna have the doctor take me off on the next appointment scared to just stop on my own and scared its somthing else wrong,1
I might just have to go in as a walk in which is a pain cause it takes a couple of hours atleast how long does the side affects last i cant handle too much longer need to find out if its the pill or scared its allergic reaction or some other illness,1
"I have the same problem in the morning I gag and feel sick to my stomach,  I wish I knew why, I mean is this part of anxiety?",1
"Wellbutrin is an upper, made my anxiety kick into overdrive too often. My bipolar is much more manic than depressive. Then the Valium throws your body back the other way. The body is constantly trying to find balance Bc those 2 drugs together pull the body different ways.",1
Good luck just make your future the best you can I no it's hard when you feel guilt from your past xxxx,1
Welbutrine gave me panic attacks but we are all wired different,1
Yikes!  A lot of anti anxiety meds!  I take Wellbutrin in morning. Be careful with Valium. Very addictive and dangerous. MY OPINION so talk to your doctor about it.❤️,1
Are all you guys mostly based in America - it's real hard getting medication off the drs here in England. He put me on sertraline (200mg daily - off the books) and all it does is stop the hysterical crying. I still have anxiety attacks. I still go into mad rages. Still have days where I just want to be a million miles away from everyone. Still have the crazy dreams. And I still have so much going on in life that I have to get through.,1
Ive been on 300mg lamictal for years and will never change from that. The only thing i found that worked for me was seroquel xr along with due to depression and anxiety. I use benedryl yo go to sleep every night. Im trying melatonin for something different. Lamictal at night also and that makes me groggy.,1
"My doctor used wellbutrin to bring me out of depression. Never for mania. In fact she watches my dosage carefully so mania isn't triggered. I'm bipolar one. I use to be on lamictal for awhile it worked well. I guess, every doc has their way of doing the meds. I just know if I get too much wellbutrin I become jiddery and anxious. Good luck",1
"I'm on 300mg of Wellbutrin, 300 trazadone, 20mg-3 times a day of buspar, 1200mg of lithium, 4 mg of proxasin( can't spell) so I honestly don't know what's working on what's not. I'm a recovering drug addict/alcoholic so I can't take narcotics anymore. I have cycothymia, ptsd, add, generalized anxiety disorder. I feel like I'm on too much shit. But everyone is different and how they respond to meds. It's hard to really get advice on that topic. I hope Wellbutrin helps you. Going thru med changes and have mental health issues and dealing with the mental health world is shitty if you ask me. I'm just trying to make it in life and keep fighting.",1
"Oh bless you! I'm also a recovering alcoholic and drug addict.  No benzodiazepines for sure. I too had to be weaned off Xanax but like you not until I was well enough from alcohol. I've been on many combinations of meds and the last 4 years the right ones for me. I'm Bipolar, major depression, catastrophic anxiety, panicky etc. but sober for 6 years!!!!",1
I am also a recovering alcoholic I have been on xanax for 23 years at this point only 8 weeks sober he does not want me to detox off this drug just yet I am also bi polar 2 PTSD anxiety,1
"My history is very similar to yours. The disease damaged your ability to manage your life properly, not you per say. I was told I am grieving the loss of who I was before this disease took hold. I also take and anti seizure med, Tegretol, which had helped immensely. However, I am also on valium for anxiety and sleep. I also take Ambien for sleep. This med is the one that truly made a difference. I have been on Wellbutrin and Buspar and sadly, really never helped. Everyone needs their own specific ""cocktail"" to be effective. I wish you all the best. ""If you find yourself in hell, keep going""~Winston Churchill. This quote has helped me  laugh and to keep moving forward. I wish the same for you!❣️",1
The only advice I have is watch for mania since you have just been manic. Antidepressants can cause mania. I'm on wellbutrin 300mg and it works well for me but I'm bp2. I also take Buspar 10mg three times a day for anxiety. And in the past I have been on Lamictal.,1
"It's very dangerous to discuss medication with people who are not professionals, but my two cents is that Wellbutrin is either heaven or hell. For me it was hell, it gave me these episodes where it felt like my entire body was buzzing and crawling with ants or something and I couldn't sit still. It was horrible, but I have many customers for who it works very very well too",1
I don't want to sleep . See I got PTSD bi polar 1 severe anxiety severe depression.  For sleep im stuck sleep brings nightmares n night terrors when im awake I have flashbacks so im double fucked . Then  bi polar n anxiety n depression hits so thats a double wammy . No wonder theres times i just want to end it all but i keep fighting second by second .So I can do it all over again to see another day . To start it all over again ...,1
"This .. when you're scared to close your eyes at night .. and when you open them the next morning you think 'oh shit, not again'.",1
"It can be so hard.  As the other post suggested, they can't be pushed.  Recovery from anxiety or depression can feel so painfully slow for the sufferer and those close to them.  I was in a similar position with a son the same age.  The most important thing I learned is for them is to know they can rely on you 100% not to push them too far, too fast, not to falter, not to give up and to be there.  Others come and go, some don't understand, this is where the loneliness can come in for them when they feel they are different, not coping or when their friends don't have time for them.  When they feel they can t control the mental illness, when it doesn't make sense, when it takes over and they can't see it getting any better, the one person they usually need to count on is their mum.  Even though they are a young adult, they are still young, still vulnerable and still needing a huge amount of support.
Gentle encouragement to move forward of course is necessary, but it has really to be governed by them, at the pace they feel comfortable with, hopefully small achievable steps will lead on to more.  Every achievement, however small it might seem to others will hopefully spur them on, drawing on past evidence to help them see they are doing well, they are moving forward.
One particularly bad time with us was the eve of a big school trip early this year, the first one in the whole of his schooling he felt able to go on.  At the last minute he couldn't go, it was too big for him.  I tried everything in my power to convince him to go. I thought it was time to throw in the towel, I thought if he couldn't do that, he d never be able to do anything.  He just said mum, I need you to understand, if I haven't got you on my side. I've got nothing, it is just too big to do at this time, please don't make me.
I quickly learned an important lesson.  At this point in his life it was too much for him to cope with, he explained it didn't mean that sometime in the future he might feel strong enough.  He's gone on to secure a job recently which was beyond my wildest dreams, I never thought it possible to overcome the anxiety of an interview. Anything is possible, but of course it's not easy, mental illness is debilitating sometimes, it's heartbreaking to see a loved one go through it, we can feel so powerless when as a parent we want to fix and protect, the hardest thing is we can't always do that.
Best wishes and good luck x

"Marilyn Corrado sorry hun, didn't mean to upset you, but I also understand how emotional it all is and how big a toll it takes on us all.  Your son sounds as though he has the best parents, all we can do is try our best, they will always know how much you have helped them.  We put our heart and soul into supporting our children, regardless of age and yes as you say it can feel such a solitary journey sometimes, but I'm sure as a family you are a strong unit and I'm sure you will all do your utmost to ensure he has a happy future, stay strong, hold on to your dreams x
Thank you for your kind words too, I'll walk over hot coals for my children, the other one is profoundly deaf so they both still need a huge amount of support, but we ll soldier on, take good care of yourself too, that's so important x",1
"My husband had a very hard time excepting it, we saw our other two sons thrive in life, one has his PHD and the other is a comic (who suffers from depression and anxiety but still can deal with it).  After years of counseling his therapist said to home school him, my husband said each day when we drove him to school was like taking him to a funeral.  He wanted so bad for him to be normal.  Our son from day one was different from the other two.  Do I want him to be normal, yes, do I want him to be happy, yes, do we all still have hope, yes?  But for now it is what it is and one day I hope there is a great advancement in drugs or treatment.  He is a wonderful, caring young man and is willing to be a guinea pig, he wants to get better, he hopes he will get better.  But for now we just wait and live this way.  God bless.",1
"Some heavy pain you are carrying there. I'm going to try and respond to the aspects you've mentioned as best as I can. Firstly, I don't think anybody here will ever say they know what you are going through. We all know that every person's condition is different, we might have similar diagnosis but how that condition affects you is not how it affects me. Friends and family who say this are most likely only trying to be there for you. Sadly it can feel as an insult but there is nothing you can do about other people. With regards to your people pleasing behaviour, well I've found that most of those suffering from a mental condition are in fact always people pleasers. We give unconditionally to the point where it drains us. It's hard to focus only on yourself because you don't want to feel selfish. Take it from a person who used to be a doormat, look after yourself and if you have time and energy you can see if you can help others. Lonely wanderer, well I think it sums up many of us here. Our conditions trap us in our minds and it's a lonely place. Personally I have no friends either, this is by choice as I have certain expectations from anybody who wants to be in my close circle. I don't trust easily, due to the once bitten twice shy syndrome. Does it bother me? Not in the least. Faith and belief, yeah well what can I say. For some it works, personally I want to vomit in my mouth when people tell me to pray etc. I've seen and experienced too much in my life to believe in anything that cannot be proven. Suicidal thoughts, at are worst we all have to deal with them. How you do that is up to you, does it matter that others don't appreciate you dealing with it on your own? Hell no. If it works for you then they can go fly a kite. Do people care about your pain? Maybe, but at the end of the day most people are selfish and care about their own issues only.  We all get tired of fighting this endless battle, in fact I have been stable for 4 years, yet after almost dying last month, coming home to the same shit, I actually wished I never survived. Does it make me weak? No, the fact that I'm still here means that I'm a tougher cookie than most people. Anyhoo, I know I can't take the pain and frustration away from you, but I hope that you will be able to see that even though we are all alone essentially, we are also surrounded by millions who are fighting alongside us to survive through their pain.",1
Why take yourself off meds. Not every manic episode is a fun . You will crash and get sicker. Don't risk feeling stable,1
"I know how u feel. I feel like my meds are controlling my mania but because of that I'm just in a mildly depressed state all the time :( I hate it. I'm so tired and unmotivated :( the problem is I go super paranoid and have to be hospitalized when the mania goes too far. But yeah I would rather be manic than depressed any day. The challenge is to find that healthy middle they call ""normal"". Good luck. Congrats on getting back to work :) but please don't go off your meds. Keep working with your doctor and get counseling",1

"I miss the manic too X I just feel the same every day. I never get overexcited anymore but coming down from the high is something I don't miss but don't come off your meds your doc knows their stuff. I also have anxiety and stress well depression, insomnia but I'm agoraphobic now too so I'm housebound 24/7. Enjoy your new job and yes stay off the caffeine lol X",1
"You need to express how you feel to someone you trust, let all that anger, sadness etc out! With anxiety do some exercise I used to do this breathing technique when I had anxiety and it helped me out so much. Just take deep breaths in and out, until you feel very relaxed. It helps a lot I haven't had anxiety for a long time(: Depression was very hard for me I basically went through depression my whole life because of my parents. Go for long walks, do all the things you love to do like sports, or hobbies. I hope this works out for you. Also know what triggers your anxiety so you can control them! If you ever get anxiety attacks do the breathing techniques!!! Try to get it off your mind, don't get frustrated if it doesn't work the first couple times I promise it will! Don't go get therapy, I did it and they don't even do anything. They are just there to hear and that's it",1
Don't stop ur meds you will go into a scary tail spin. I know because I've done it b4. Best wishes,1
"Even after years of dealing with depression, most the time I don't realize my sleeping habits are an indication of depression. I don't purposely do it. I just end up sleeping --- a lot. For example, I thought I was over my recent bout, and now I've done nothing but sleep for 3 days in a row. Honestly when I go through these phases for a week or so I just tell myself ""I'm catching up in sleep"". The good thing is, it's better then the flat out misery of staying awake through it during the day and dealing with it. I'd much rather deal with this sort of depression. At least I don't have to deal with any issues for a few days - a week. U like most people my cycles are so insane I still don't recognize where I'm at most the time, as I just try to discount my symptoms. Which I have gotten much better at. The bad side is I get to where I tell myself I can go back to work for a few days a month. Make plans to do so, then this shit starts back up. Unlike most people I'm the opposite. Summer months are worse for me then winter months. Still rapid cycle through both, but more ups then down winter months. Glad these posts show up on my timeline. I don't respond often but it seems helpful ones show up at least once a month ..",1
"This is our new normal.
Float out in good time.
Remember when you are down you can only remember the bad things.
When you are up and normal you only remember the normal times.
Try not to get into mania's.
Look into people's eyes and if they are looking horrified at your grandiose pressured speech, give them some space.
Seroquel is good to prevent mania's.
Cut your credit cards up to prevent spending sprees in mania's

"Oh wow.  Thank you so much Kathy Lilly for your encouragement.  Im once again having to switch doctors my mine closed their practice. Sometimes I feel that my PCP does not take me seriously.  They have pushed me to another psychiatrist but my insurance doesn't cover in my area, so now I have to worry about paying out of pocket.  Its just crazy and I feel that there is no end to this.  My panic attacks had started getting better but now they are full blown again.  I dont understand this, ive always been very intelligent, outgoing and articular and now I dont feel it anymore. I watched my mother suffer from mental disorders and i always vowed that i would not let my children see me go through something that like.  but the damn cycle continues.",1
"Well, my dear, you are not alone!  I have them all myself and often feel like a juggling act!   All my kids and Grandkids are grown, so I don't have to worry about little ones.  I hate the manic state of the bi-polar depression.  Sometimes, I am there for a couple weeks. I have been on mood stabilizers for a while now.  My Dr. Increased my dose  by 25 mg.   I could tell the difference within a week. It is called lamactil.  Stopped the hamster wheel in my brain.   Was having horrible panic attacks.  So it helped that, as well.    I would go from 1 extreme to another..  so maybe talk to your Dr. Or Psychiatrist!  I take a lot of other meds. Relating to my other illneses.  Had brain surgery and life has never been the same.  But know you are not alone out there my friend.",1

"I try not to allow ""emphasis on try"" what others say or think about me because they are not contributing to my well being. I have heard it all. I just go on with my life, my struggle & try to take one day at a time. It is however unbelievable that there is still so much stigma still. I really believe it's more of a lack of empathy problem in our society.",1
"Yes as someone struggling for years with untreated mental illness I agree that feeling like I have no purpose  is one of the worst feelings . I totally struggle with my self  hate depression, and anxiety suicidal thoughts self harm insecurities hopelessness worthlessness etc .. they all make me end up feeling so bad that I want to kill my self ..I feel like I have no meaning or purpose no reason to live . I totally get it. It all makes perfect sense ..I'm tired of  pretending to be strong .. ready to give up. I'm just saying your not alone . I feel this too",1
"My mother has had quite the battle over the years struggling to find the right diagnosis and medications to help with them. She lost my father and all five of her kids when we were growing up ( she also partook in drugs/alcohol so that didnt help matters).. Now I'm 29, and for the last decade or so I've been able to have a good relationship with her, and she's a phenomenal grandmother to my boys. She tried to take.her life many times as well in the past, and much like yourself she was always saved (and sometimes just barely). I guess the point of all of this is to just let you know that it does get better. You can't take away the past and any mistakes you've made, but you DO have the option for a brighter future! Don't give up, please. Your daughter still needs you no matter how old she may be right now, and I'm sure there are many who love you despite your trials. Let the medicine help and find your voice with your doctors if they don't. 
You've got this    feel free to PM me if you ever want me to share more ❤",1
"Medication is trial and error and takes a bit to work out but once you get it and it's good life is so much better. Hang in there and keep fighting.

It's all new too me and I struggle as well. I try using comedy movies to distract.,1
I also suffer from depression and anxiety and have suicidal thoughts and images sometimes daily. I have tried to accept it is a part of me but I still have good days and bad days..,1
I have both as well. It really is shitty. The doctors are right. That's how we're wired. Start a journal and each day keep track of your moods any suicidal ideation. If you become obsessed with this go to hospital immediately,1
Doctors are so full of shit its unbelievable. They cant even dispence the right medicine. Get away from those negative quacks u are a hell of a lot better and sarter than they are. Listen to your heart not your mind. I know Ive been there and I hate it when all those thoughts come into my mind. I shake it off breath deep and think of positive stuff. It helps a lot than shitty doctors.,1
"I have both bpd and bipolar disorder 1 with psychotic features, ptsd and ga. I have struggled hard with suicidal ideation. My psychiatrist has never told me I will always have those thoughts. The last time I had a bad depression I was on the verge of becoming homeless, I fought suicidal ideation for two months straight. I even wrote a suicide note. When I told my psychiatrist, he didn't even bat an eye. No med adjustment. I had gotten through the crisis myself without going to hospital. The thing is, I completely was suicidal and it all hedged on if I could find a place to live or not. I am disabled. It was January. I had just lost my van in the summer and was not moving by choice. I have pets, a mobility scooter and my son backed out of sharing a place with me at the last minute (I can't afford a place on my own. I live in the third most expensive place to rent a one bedroom in Canada) My daughter could only take me for two weeks or lose her rent subsidy and possibly get evicted so that was out. I had nowhere to go. I had been homeless before and I just didn't have the strength to do it again. To lose everything again and end up in a tiny room without my pets was just too much for me. I planned it. Of course the day I was to surrender my dog to a rescue I got the call that my now roommate and I were approved for a place. I had planned on not waking up the next morning. But I digress. Your Therapist said you will always have those thoughts. My psychiatrist never even addressed it. And no, I can't just get another doc. There's a doctor shortage here. People don't have doctors and are going to walk in clinics and the hospital because they have no doctor. I don't think I'll ever get past having those thoughts. I just hope I never act on them. This January was the closest I've been in several years to it.",1
It does happen.with bipolar one you are more dangerous to yourself and could end up badly hurting yourself .with bipolar two it's more self harm.but with medication and alot of positive thoughts you can cope.just tell yourself when you in a bad situation this is my sickness .tomorrow I will wake up and feel better.its a roller coaster our ability to cope.but as any sickness we have to learn to cope and be strong.be good to yourself. Find things u enjoy .don't worry about the past and what hurt you or broke you .Just live each day as it comes and it will get better,1
"I used to suffer multiple suicidal thoughts every single day for over 30years, and sometimes I would act on them.
I am also borderline and bipolar, with ADHD.
Since being on seroquel (quetiapine), I can go months without the thoughts, and when I do get them they are only fleeting.
It has been pure bliss not having that daily struggle.
I still hate me, but seroquel has been a godsend for alleviating those thoughts.
I also started lithium 4 months ago to help alleviate the ups n downs of bipolar....so far so good.",1
I think it's a very hard thing to hear but it's the truth ... I'm not bipolar but I do struggle with intense depression and anxiety . I struggle daily with suicidal thoughts and  wanting to cut myself .. but at least a professional is telling u it's normal instead of making you seem crasy like everyone makes me feel insane or dramatic. I would love to find someone who will take me seriously and understand my pain hurt sadness despair and sorrow .im very very suicidal but no one makes me feel ok about it,1
"My counselor said that I am border personality. Threw me for a loop. By umpteenth yrs, of being told I am bipolar, with anxiety tendency. When I was told I was bordline personality. With agroaphoic",1
"Seems a bit harsh to tell you you'll always have them. They may be part of who you are now, but mental illness is a journey and you may experience changes for the better with practice and time. That said, emotions are never wrong, they just are. All you can do is choose whether or not you encourage a feeling by dwelling on it, or choose to  reevaluate your thought process and try to gain a different perspective. Suicidal thoughts are a reaction to difficult and painful feelings: you have the power to change how you react to your feelings even if you can't directly change the feeling itself. Your mind is plastic and regenerative. Thought patterns can become habitual, but habits can be relearned.",1
"It's the harsh truth. For some people it makes the fight easier. For others, not so much. If your therapist is a good one, they told you for a reason. For me personally, knowing it's just a part of my brain and not a part of who I am as a person was extremely helpful. I know when to reach out, when it gets too difficult to handle myself. Because I will always have them. And that's okay. Better to learn how to handle it rather than making it a constant struggle to fix it.",1
"To be honest, I would be relieved to hear this from a professional. Every time I have been open about these thoughts being my default, I wake up with a hefty hospital bill. I don't have any plans, it's just a part of my life that I deal with. I can't tell you that you'll always have these thoughts because I am not here to play armchair psychologist but maybe the finality of what the doctors are saying is disturbing to some. Dealing with bipolar and borderline is tough. It's work. Every single day of your life, you are fighting. I know I am. Some days, it exhausts me so much that these thoughts resurface at the forefront of my mind but once again, as long as I don't have a plan, they're not a cause for alarm to ME, personally.",1
"Kristi Dietz Thank you so much for this comment. We are not alone in this struggle. Bipolar disorder never gives me a rest and I think you put it best when you described how all it's ""a daily, exhausting struggle talking yourself down or up all day long."" We're planners through and through, haha.",1
"I agree with you. Instant inpatient. It's almost like my suicide ideation are one of my ""coping skills"" when shit gets super hard. I have had them for 30 years. Sometimes I  start to conjure up a plan but I also have a plan in place to stop planning. I'm very organized in my planning. Lol but not really lol. It is a daily, exhausting, struggle talking yourself down or up all day long. Sometimes you just feel like ugh this is ridiculous and you Yearn for peace and rest.... how I perceive these ""ideations"" I just get sick of the fight. I am tired. Where's my easy button bc meds just take the edge off. I would like pretty please and easy carefree day filled with magical mermaids and sweet tarts    l",1
"True, but chances are higher if it's always on the forefront of one's mind. Mine was like that. I hit one stressful situation and attempted suicide. I'm still so close to doing it again, and it feels like I get even closer with each passing day. I just want the thoughts to stop.",1
I am tired. I love my kids I love my grandkids but I'm tired tired of fighting it's a losing battle everyday is a struggle scared who you going to piss off scared to open your mouth scared of what somebody might say about you it's a losing battle I'm so tired of it all,1
"My mania is not enjoyable it's anger, irritability a nd feeling like I'm just gonna completely go over the edge! It's so horrible any body else experienced this?",1
"I love it until I get irritable, if I didn't have kids I wouldn't be on meds",1
"I hope to have manic episodes because it makes me very active, not need so much sleep and more obsessive (as in cleaning). I miss those episodes. Wish I knew how to trigger mine",1
"I usually enjoy my manic phases during them. I'm more social, energetic and productive but afterwards I  tend to be self conscious and anxious about the things I  may have said or did.",1
"Just came off of a 6 week episode of mania or hypomania, whatever it is! 
I LOVE it for all the same reasons we all do, but know I cannot keep up with it all forever, but sure wish I could! No fear of the world at all...
Then I start to get irritated by everything under the sun & then the ugly depression comes. I have many more episodes of depression than mania and would give anything for it to be reversed.",1
"I would always much rather be manic than depressive. But when I'm manic I'm very irritable and honestly just a bitch, but I'm trying my best to calmly tell myself I'm over reacting.",1
"Manic,depressed, paranoia, psychosis, I hate all of it. Doctor visits, therapists 1:1, partial hospitalizations, hospitalizations, med changes, provider changes, costs for treatment and meds, loss of all relationships, isolation, weight changes, insomnia, nonfunctional, wrong diagnosis, dual diagnoses...I'm on the damn Good Ship Lollipop.",1
"I enjoy that I feel more motivated and less numb... but I also dread my more manic times because I make split second decisions and am often irrational and compulsive, which has gotten me into trouble before.",1
"I like it but the irritability bothers me some and the cockyness of me not caring what my decisions do to my family bothers me, but not enough to stop me doing it. I live at the bottom of the wave so much that surfing the top right now I just want to ride and let loose. I know I'll crash bit until then surfs up.",1
"Nope. As much time as people like us spend self-loathing and wallowing in mental and emotional misery, it's nice to let loose and just do our own thing when our shitty-bo-gitty brains let us",1
"I enjoy mine, but it also scares the crap out of me especially knowing the crash is coming fast. I between the times I don't sleep, have great ideas, get things done that have been looming for a long time, I am also very defensive, more combative, and easily irritated and willing to act irrationally or run away",1
Love the productive and creative side of mania . Hate the irritability and conflict that it brings though.,1
I take Seroquel to stop the mania's and lagactil which is an old drug. Epilim is better than lithium as it does not strain the kidneys.,1
"After reading this Ian like this but my doc say I only have anxiety and depression ,I have highs  and think nothing of doing anything and feel fab then the low when I dont want  to speak to anyone and shut myself away ,I get in trouble at work and  beacuse   I do I think people are talking about me",1
That is pretty universal for at least part of the experience.  After a while being out of control can be very terrifying.,1
Mania is ok until I end up completely paranoid and psychotic..hearing voices and seeing things are not welcome additions to my mania,1
"I don't, because while at times it makes me feel confident and fantastic-  at  other times it makes me quite agitated and irritable and I can be hurtful when I am that type of manic.",1
Usually when I am manic is when I go into spiralling uncontrollable rages too. Not one thing fun about that either.,1
"I used to love it... until they worked their way into crazy manias which got me into trouble. Or I dropped dramatically into suicidal lows suddenly. Or I went from manic to paranoid, psychotic, wondering what reality actually was.  Yeah, I had some mania's which were just great fun. Very productive, lots of energy, creative, positive about everything and everyone. Fun fun fun. I did enjoy them, a lot. Haven't had a mania for 7 years now due to taking medication and I like stability a lot more. The lows which followed were awful and I'm finally not seeming to have them anymore either (first few years of med no mania but lots of lows). Mania's were fun but personally I am liking stable a lot more. :)",1
"I find it very stressful because my behavior, during these times, does not match who I really am.  I have tried conventional meds and am very resistant to them, therefore, I am no longer on anything. I have lost people due to my behavior and I don't blame them. Doesn't mean they are better than me, I take it as one can only take what I dish out for so long. I have found, and this is not for others to do without their doctor's guidance, is that I am 'better controlled' without prescribed meds. It does have its downfalls as in, I am more isolated, but I also don't make an ass of myself. Is this balance? Probably not, but it keeps me from taking people on my mental Rollercoaster, at least for now.",1
"It's the most dangerous part of being bipolar. You can bring it down and manage it with Seroquel and lagactil and other medications.
It's hard to control your self and you can loose a lot of friends.
Great creativity but often it just feels like you are busy but you do not actually get anything done.
Not that I have tried these drugs but I think it's like being on LSD and cocaine at once. Yes we like it. Yes we manage it.
When you see that look of horror in other people's eyes when you are talking to them with manic pressured speech give them some space and take a little extra medication to come down.",1
"I think most do, however it gives me anxiety and I dont. For the most part I have recurrent depression which is even more awful, but with the meds I'm on I tolerate it and I'm well if I do the work to stay that way.",1
I completely understand but hate the shame or embarrassment I feel after,1
"Everyone's different. I hate it. I get aggressive and mean and grouchy and really anxious. And that's not to mention all the stupid decisions I make, like shopping and stuff.",1
"I enjoy being productive and more creative. The feeling of not caring what others think is good too, but I always fall back into depression before I can finish what I started. I tend to have a million things going on at once and none of them complete. When I'm feeling depressed all of that tends to make me feel overwhelmed, guilty, and disgusted with myself. So, it's a toss up. I only like being manic in the moment.",1
"I can see how it looks, and I get down on myself when it happens.   But, sometimes, everything seems too heavy, too much, too overwhelming.",1
I am so glad that you found a doctor that was willing to look more into things rather than just state that its a product of your mental health disorder. I am really struggling with the medications that I am taking because it seems like a never ending cycle. I know I need the meds to remain stable but I don't feel like I reached stability yet as my meds continue to be adjusted,1
"Thanks for sharing.  I've tried to over dose 3 times.  Each time I felt so alone and it would never feel better.  Praise God it did but it took changing meds, support from friends and family and some time to let it happen.  I'm stable today and I have been for about 9 months.  I'm a little stressed now because we are changing a med because of weight gain, I pray it works.  God bless you your doing great!!!",1
I suffered for years with an extremely low mood and had tried to kill myself on more than one occasion. My thyroid was also out of range and despite supplements etc I ended up having my thyroid removed 2 years ago. I now take thyroxine daily along with my meds for depression and anxiety. The difference this has made to my low mood is dramatic. Don't get me wrong I still suffer with bouts of low mood but they are not as bad and are not all the time anymore. Please do not underestimate what a malfunctioning thyroid can do to your depression as the thyroid regulates an awful lot in your body. Stay strong and safe xx,1
Thank you Vicki. Early 2015 I tried a paleo diet to see if it helped my mood & I had amazing results. Until I had several stressful life events all around the same time & I crashed big time & just didn't get well. Because I was so unwell I stopped cooking & eating nutrient dense foods & juzt got sicker. As I'm getting my energy back I'm back into cooking & doing really well on a paleo type diet. I truly believe what we eat plays a huge role in mental health. #foodasmedicine,1

"GOD DAMMIT BOOGIE NO ONE WANTS TO FUCK PAIN
WELL IN INVERSENESS THEY DO
FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS FOR YOU AS A HEALING MECHANISM ITS HERE BUT TO DWELL ON PAIN AND IT BECOMES YOUR MASTER AND DOMINATES YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS IS JUST PATHETIC...PAIN IS PART OF LIFE PAIN IS NOT LIFE PART NOT WHOLE

"I'm currently on 45 mg of remeron along with 600mg seroquel. I take both at night due to both inducing sleep. I was diagnosed 22 years ago and have struggled to find the right meds for me to feel close to normal and function to the best of my ability. I've been on seroquel for 9 years, trying remeron was the best thing that has happened to me . I've been on the combo for almost 2 years and am happier than I've been on any other meds! And I was lucky enough not to experience the side effect of weight gain.",1
"Never tried it,do any of you get nightmares, that are so real?? I'm tortured by them, to the fact that I jump up covered in sweat! And have to sit for a while, look around me!! Working out where I am!! Then worry all day that maybe it was a premonition. Oooh awful xxxxb",1
"Still struggling, nothing works. I could just be a total piece of shit in reality- regardless of my medication.",1
Is it like a physical anxiety?  Jittery in legs or both legs and arms?  May be you're suffering from the side effects of restless leg syndrome or Akathesia.  Call the doc right away.,1
I take Seroquel at night to help me sleep. It's been wonderful for my insomnia. The first couple of months I had restless leg syndrome but that has tapered off.,1
Ya and it doesnt help my anxiety and panic attacks,1
Seraqual makes me sick light headed and dizzy and nausea iv only been on it for about two months 100 milagrams i started geting a rash too so i started breaking it half i didnt just want to stop like that scared of withdrawls im waiting to go to the doc so i could stop takeing it but i need something else to take its place it sucks it makes me sleep good but its just too manny side affects,1
I realized this frame of life was stealing my joy. I was too often living in an imaginary upsetting future..,1
"Anxiety doesn't MAKE you do anything. You choose to react to it thusly. It is you who made these choices.

I know because I have experienced all of this and more, and changed it all too by choosing to be honest and realize I am in control at all times. I am not a victim!",1
"Flipping right anxiety is bloody awfull!!!""I suffer from panic attacks they get so bad I cry coz I'm so scared of dien coz that's wat it feels like ye can't Brethe properly",1
"yup, I had aasked my boyfriend the other day if he was getting tired of me, my anxiety causes me to over think. I wish it would let me be. but no anxiety comes over and whispers in my ear. I'm also afraid of losing him. I love him so much.",1
I get all shaky and hyperventilate,1
"if you have never experienced anxiety - you will never ""get it"".......",1
"True story!!      
Others think you just stop because other people have ""real"" things to worry about.",1
"OMG! I JUST LOVE AND THANK YOU FOR THIS POST. I take depakot as well. And my hair has falling out horribly. I used to have real thick hair not so much anymore. I'm going to talk to my doc about this. Sadly, I might have to stay on it. It's part of my med combo, a combo that's working for me right now and it's hard to get me on a cocktail that works. I have bipolar 1. Thanks again for this post.",1
I too experienced hair loss with depakote- what happened is it takes a while for the depakote to start the hair loss- doubt seriously it has anything to do with the name brand or the generic.  Selenium is supposed to help decrease the hair loss but I found it continued unabated until I stopped the medication.  And my hair was never as thick again after the hair loss.  I kept the hair in a ziplock bag because I knew they doctors would just write it off- when I brought in a full bag of hair they could see why I was upset and requesting a medication change.,1
Some day's can be a struggle.,1
It's a life of struggling but I've come far enough to learn how to enjoy and learn from my struggles and I have a couple friends that know me well and understand me assnd never have they given up on me.  That kind of support gets me thru a day.  Also having ADHD added to the list of my life makes some days go by thst I can't even remember em.  But.  I still love my life.  Most of the time.  Lol,1
I wish my family cared about me none of them talk to me because they think I'm crazy and should be in a home  I HAVE PTSD CLINICAL DEPRESSION AND CHRONIC ANXIETY AND BIPOLAR,1
No problem I know what its like to isolate n be alone n misunderstood I have bpd n am bipolar with anxiety and depression,1
"Latuda works great for my bipolar depression. But I was having this problem in the night that kind of felt like restless legs but it was both my legs and arms, and which I ended up with akathisia. Sorry, not sure how to spell it. I felt looking at up to give you an exact description of what akathisia is trauma it looks like you're having a seizure in your arms and legs, where they felt absolutely horrible and I had to keep walking around and around and around well my arms and legs did these constant movements.  Some kind of nerve disorder, I believe is what they say. If you know what I mean by restless legs and that you cannot even sit or lay down or even stand in place, akathisia is 50 times worse. So I would say, yes, try it, if your doctor wants you to. But as soon as you start, if you start having those weird feelings in your arms and legs, I would say stop immediately even though they always want you to wean yourself off, and call your doctor immediately. Good luck!",1
"It gave me severe anxiety/panic attacks. If you have any side effects like this, you can stop taking it immediately without issue.",1
It gave me really restless legs had to stop taking it,1
"Altered my moods further rather than stabilizing them. Also made me restless at times, and other times practically narcoleptic. Hated it and stopped after month. Im on Lamictal now with the only real side effect being constant thirst.",1
"I accomplished more than I ever thought I would...managed to work for about 45 yrs. retired in '07.  Now I can take it slow & easy in my golden years....been bi/polar since '92.  I'm able to recognize triggers better today & free to live at my own pace...I'm a recluse, (happy recluse) don't have to battle each day...wishing I was dead...I pray to never have to live like that again.  Cannot imagine how a young person can face their future with mental illness before their adult lives have hardly begun.  Jesus is my closest friend today...I've learned to lean on Him & trust Him...even when it seems He's not listening.  Be patient, he doesn't give us all the answers at once, He wants us to realize that ultimately He is in control & will deliver us day by day...our suffering molds us into a different person eventually & gives us the strength we need to get through our darkest hours.
God Bless you, everyone...always take your meds & see your Dr...practice patience...try your best to stay as calm as possible.
WTW = wait to worry...",1
"I worry about it too... But I just have to remind myself that I am loved, and can do anything I put my mind to.",1
I worry about this too,1
"Do not worry my friend. I've been to hell and back and always learned something about myself. I'll be going back to school to get my degree. Never thought I'd be able to do that. You can do anything,and I mean it. Good luck and God bless!",1
"It is soooo hard to get the motivation started though, the only way I get moving is when I have a dr appointment, or a psych appointment...even that is a struggle! My husband tries  to help alot, and can get me moving on occasion, but I have gained almost double my weight since being on meds for 9 years, changing them every so often, but nothing seems to help!!! So I understand COMPLETELY!!!!!",1
"I feel EXACTLY the same way! I am starting to experience some improvement since being started on the following medication regimen:  lithium 600 mg per day, lamotrigine 300 mg per day, and bupropion XL 150 mg. Hang in there and try to keep the faith. I have been fighting this horrible illness for 5 years. I had several occasions where I wanted to give up but I have persevered. You can too!",1
"I feel the same way. Try to get out of bed. No desire o do anything. I know I need to get motivated but, the depression and anxiety hurts. I have been on every new drug that they have invented. Nothing brings me out of depression. I have made some bad decisions that have made my depression better.",1
I'm too anxious to use the phone at all.,1
"Hey Terra, I suffer from bipolar and anxiety i did the ect treatments for a year and at the time i thought it was great it was worth the memory loss, but i think it was just the break it gave me.  my head wasn't cloudy i could actually think and it felt good, but like with meds it doesn't last and your left with the memory loss.  all i can tell you is keep fighting, keep going to your doctors as much as it takes, if you have to go to the hospital for a break.. it took 15 years of fighting and trying everything, from meds, to hospital stays, to taking classes to realize i'm really not alone and to learn what i can do... but i'm happy to say i've won...i am down to one pill a day and i feel normal my memory is coming back and i have so much to live for...let your doctor tell you what he thinks you should do next thats what he is there for...good luck...",1
"Honestly almost all of memory loss stems from my depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I'm slightly better with my memory when on the right medication",1
Im 40 with bpd bipolar depression anxiety etc I also lack the ability to recall most of my childhood n have problems maintaining thoughts at the age of 40 its depressing to have lived half your life n not remember most of it I wish so much that I could remember I don't think its worth your past I know I wish I had mine but that's just from someone who is very depressed with no memory,1
"I am at the end stage of my bout now, the last week I have driven myself and my boyfriend insane, to such a point, he was hurting because of my reaction, I feel like a different person and I cannot stop it or be logical because there is no real reason for my own head, just a guess a cycle going round and round until I crack. I am going to doctors tomorrow, as the pattern is formed and see it happening even before it started. With that in mind if I see it unfolding, why can't I stop it because it's ruining all aspects of my life. Anxious, afraid, nervous, my confidence, my working life and my social life, really need help. I'm 37 now and feel stupid for feeling so pathetic. My head is a horrible place to be in sometimes",1
It gets overwhelming and exhausting.  And then...I still worry and have doubts.,1
"My husband just came off sort of accidentally.  He forgot to put them in his pill pack for about a week.   They were next on the elimination list and his doctor said not to worry about it, since he wasn't experiencing any issues just proceed without them. No issues.",1
I'm sorry I'm giving up on myself and my  life.. I'm sorry suicide is my only option left .. I'm sorry I'm struggling. Sorry for being a worthless failure . Sorry that I am going to leave you so soon.. sorry I have no more reasons to live,1
It scares me to be manic. I feel like I've lost control of myself. I don't know if that makes sense.,1
"Or as my husband always tells me ""don't worry, can't figure out how to do that either",1
afraid if someone does this I may break down.....:(,1
"dizziness, zaps, nausea, irritable, shaky, and I'll just kind of zone out here and there.",1

"This is going to sound harsh and me myself find it hard to deal with but we have something very not accepted wrong with us. We don't deal well with things,  we seldom stay on our meds & really do they ever really work.  I think we all need to start trying to harden up,  why do we need the world to love us, why do we think everyone doesn't like us. I read the posts every day and we seem so lost and so needy.  Why can't we just learn to live and let everyone else worry if they are good enough for us.  I'm truly sick of feeling like a victim or being victimized lets face it we've done some f'd up stuff. Please lets all of us take a deep breath and appreciate that we can live just live xxx",1
"I too have a 17 year old.  Very friendly, kind...especially to those in need.  Before we got him the right help he was hospitalized multiple times during manic phases over three years.  He went from having hundreds of friends to having no friends because of his uncontrolled behavior.  Once he was properly medicated he leveled out and has returned to his old self.  His friends never returned, but he has a new hope.  It is nice to read the positive comments on this site.  I would just add that at 17...your not alone.  There are others wishing they too had someone like you to talk too and relate.   Keep up with your doc visits and medicine.  There are people out there waiting to become your friend.",1
I don't have any friends.  I give up trying to have anyone understand what I am going through.  I do have dogs and they help with my stress and mood swings.,1
"Same I just graduated high school which was hard for me due to many absenses cuz my anxiety and depression made it hard to get out of bed or concentrate.  My whole high school life (all of school actually) I had hardly any friends or they were just people to talk to about assignments. No one knew about the real me tho idk how they didn't see my crumbling mental state. The only way I got thru was my twin giving me love I didn't deserve, and I told one of my trusted teachers when I was down. My advice is to try to find an adult you trust and ask for support or forthwm to just listen. My mom worked and I don't talk to my dad so I found a new father figure in my brother who helped me tons thru out my entire life. You will make it you're also my there!❤️ I almost died junior year from one of many suicide tries, and trust me this year will go by fast. I care about you pls don't do anything tonight that will hurt you cuz I love you   ❤️ You are so strong look how far you've come ❤️   keep your head above the waves beautiful❤️",1
"Listen to everyone on here who tells you they go through this/have gone through this too. They're not lying. And look how many there are!! You'll find your place. I was so alone at 17 too. Only in my 30's did i meet my ""tribe"" of true friends. Until then I desperately tried to make people like me, and made terrible relationship choices. I wish I'd just spent that alone time being glorious ""me"". Hang in there.",1
"The people at my church when i was in high school ignored me. The other girls never knew what to say because they couldnt relate. It was like i didnt exist. Youth group was awful. The other girls could talk and cry and got listened to and hugged but no one ever said anything to me. Either there was an awkward silence or they would act like i hadnt said anything. The leaders of the group basically said it was my own fault. Yeah. Good Christians, right? I dont even bother going to church anymore. I dont have to be a church member to be a christian.",1
"Friends should NOT make you feel terrible.  That's not a friend.  I don't know who that is, but you should probably either tell them to knock it off or dump them from your life.  You do NOT need that.  ""Actual friends"" don't walk away just because you're having issues.  That's not a good friend, either.  They may need to set boundaries that are healthy and appropriate so they don't get overstressed or burned out dealing with your mood swings, but they don't just walk away.  That will make you feel worse and it seems like you don't need to feel any worse.  Your ""actual"" friends...have you tried reaching out to them again?  Apologizing and explaining where you are mentally?  If they're really your friends, they'll come back to you.  As for your family...Do you have grandparents, a cousin, or an aunt you can go to if your parents have walked away from you?  Are you getting therapy?  If not, you should definitely be doing that for yourself.  Are you on any meds?  If so, stick with them.  If you're feeling worse on those medications, do NOT be afraid to tell your therapist that they aren't effective.  There's a lot of other meds they can try until you find something that helps with your depression and your anxiety.  

Remember...you're only 17.  You still have a long life ahead of you where you can make friends who will be there for you.  Don't give up.  My best wishes are with you.",1
Sounds like my life all over I've lost people on the way and friends made some new friends that took me a lot of strength and courage and they stabbed me in my back because of my decisions in life and stupid choices I made but doesn't everyone I've currently left everything behind and moved with my bf and now I'm back to square one with no one at times it feels hard but really it's so much easier less stress and problems life will get better you just need the right people in your life you live and you learn xx,1
I was on Zoloft i was taken off of it .I have PTSD BI polar severe anxiety severe depression.  I was put on seroqual lithium trazodon minipress Cymbalta,1
"I'm on Zoloft which only took the edge off my depression and did nothing for my anxiety at all.  I was put on Gabapentin for anxiety, which does seem to help me, but things didn't get ""right"" for me until they put me on Wellbutrin (with Zoloft & Gabapentin at the same time).  Now, I feel normal...like I did BEFORE all the depression and anxiety hit me.  You just have to keep trying different meds until you find something that works for you.  I'm sorry that you're dealing with this.  :(  It's so hard sometimes.",1
"First of all, I am so sorry for your loss and I am sending prayers <3  I take 100mgs of Zoloft and it just feels ""normal"" for me.  I still get angry, sad, anxious etc.  I am also on 1mg of Xanax.  I hope that you are ok <3",1
This is a true story. I asked my older son to go to group therapy with me and he refused. I need Lee had a switch turn on in me and I chewed him out called him names told him he didn't care he was selfish conceded and told him never to call me again I feel bad now because I deleted his phone number from my phone book I have no way of getting ahold of him and I need to apologize to him I didn't mean it I don't know what happened I'm triggered this one off I got upset because I want him to know me and understand me and he doesn't want to and I was hurt so basically I run my older son all not intentionally he bought me necklaces for Christmas the things I told him I was throwing them in the garbage I was terrible I don't know what to do I made a big mistake and I don't know how to correct it,1
"Baby,
I was CATFISHED. Went so far as to pick out diamond rings & looking @ 4 million dollar homes.. once All fell apart.. due to chronic ongoing stress, pressure & PTSD.. I downed a half bottle of sleep meds.. was dieing when a relative came into my room. Fig out what I had done & called 911.
This was Tues of THIS week.
Call if you need to. Been here once before. No one gets better without a lil' support.
Can't talk now, have to crash, but call tom, we,' ll  chat Dear. PLEASE try and sleep. Pray for you..

I have a friend who has had a horrible experience using it. I would investigate it thoroughly. Just sharing...,1
"I truly loved my Cymbalta after it got added to my Lyrica and Lamictal.  After years of medication merry-go-round, that combo was great.  The two were pretty ok together, but after Cymbalta got added in, it really was a game changer.  I was on it for near a year with no real side effects other than a little bit of weight from the total combination.   I only went off to start a family.  My bipolar, migraines, fibromyalgia,  restless leg, ptsd and gad were ALL responding and were in remission and well controlled. 

It was a 3mo fight to get insurance to pay for  it at the time though",1
"Their are a lot of coping skills you can use for anxiety and panic attacks that work, you may want to try that route first. I refuse to take anti-anxiety meds. I take my other meds cause I had scans done on my brain amd we got to the root of my problem. Its a lot of work finding what works and doesn't.  I will never just ""trust"" a Doctor's choice for me. I research. Your concerns are valid.",1
"I'm so glad that you came through your surgery. It must have been a very traumatic time for you. I also wish your health issues were better for you since your surgery. 
I'm sorry I cannot offer you any personal experience with Cymbalta as I've never taken it. If you have trust in your doctor though & he/she feels it will help you, maybe you should give it a try? I guess that unless you try it, you won't know any different right?

Can I please ask you a question though? 
Do you feel that your hysterectomy has directly affected your anxiety & depression or do you feel your ongoing health issues are more to blame? 

I ask this as I cannot take the contraceptive pill to stop my periods & because the hormones produced during, directly affect my bipolar in the worst way, my doctors & I are now looking into other avenues to stop my periods or lessen their impact. These include going onto HRT, taking oestrogen during periods or having a total hysterectomy including ovaries removed which as you would be aware, also involves HRT. 
I have no idea which method will work but I do know that something has to be done as that time of month is without doubt my absolute 'most dangerous period' (I am most likely to self harm or suffer such debilitating depression etc that I have very real suicidal idealisations & have attempted in the past as a result).

Any advice or information you can give me about your experience would be very much appreciated. I have an appointment next week to find out what the best plan of action my GP & psych have come up with as they planned to speak about this before the appointment.

I have a close friend who has suffered anxiety for many years but after she was forced (for other medical reasons) to have a hysterectomy, she has found that the severity of her anxiety symptoms have lessened significantly compared to before the surgery.

As you could imagine, I'm very anxious & confused as to what to do.",1
"Melissa Mayes thank you for telling me your story & for your thoughts & prayers. 
I will find out on Wednesday what my doctor feels is the best way forward but I do know that I have only 3 options as I mentioned above, which involve either taking oestrogen during my periods, going onto HRT or lastly, a full hysterectomy (including the ovaries) then HRT. 
I'd be a fool if I didn't admit that I'm scared but I do know that something has to be done. I cannot continue this way.",1
A close friend was prescribed Cymbalta for depression & she got some uncomfortable side effects for the first few days so she ceased the medication. The Dr told her that was quite common & would probably have subsided within the week.,1
"I have been on Cymbalta for three years. I actually feel great. The drawbacks however, are the side effects I am experiencing. It is apparently affecting my nervous system, which makes me sweat a lot. And I mean a LOT! I am a health care aide and I sweat so badly at work that my scrub top is soaked within an hour into my shift. It's not a common side effect, however. I am just unfortunate to experience it. I just lowered my dose, which was hard due to the side effects of that. The sweating has improved minimally, if at all. I hope this  helps! Feel free to message me if you want to chat more!",1
I have heard horrible experiences,1
Well I take Cymbalta I used to be on Zoloft and now I take Cymbalta and it kind of makes me feel like I'm on cruise control I don't get upset I don't get angry helps my depression a whole lot and I'll try to go off of it several times but everytime I do my depression always comes back and it's a lot worse people can always tell that's around me that I'm not taking my medicine so I take the generic brand I get it from Kentucky and I get mine for $21 for a 90 day supply.,1
"They just prescribed me that and I'm scared to take any kind of medicine because they gave me Prozac two weeks ago and it brought on my depression and suicidal thoughts, so I had to stop it!",1
"Thanks everyone for the feeedback. I know that some ppl are against medications but some ppl just have to have them. I have also been on Klonopin for years for my anxiety attacks. I have been through a very big ordeal. I cannot even remember being in the hospital or what even happened to me. I don't even remember my friends and family even coming to visit me. I have had a very deep depression and that is just not me. I have to at least try something to see if it works. My doctor says the patience that he has on the medicine has had a very good success rate with it. I also have pain and I understand that it is used for pain as well. And as far as giving it to God, that so have done. I pray about my life and my life's situations quite often. Imagine going in for a simple procedure and ending up in ICU on an intebator. And then coming out with over 100k dollars in hospital and doctor bills to boot! This had also effected my marriage and I just got married last October. So, if I have to try a medication for my depression, hell it's at least worth a try. I just hate side effects, but I understand that's a risk with any medication.",1
"Paula Santana so many cooks in the kitchen! I appreciate that people care, but it can all be so muddled. IF, a year or whenever from now, you do decide to come off, do the 7 a day method: take seven of those tiny beads out of the pill day one & two, then 14 the next two, then 21...you get the idea. It was tough but I was able to do it. (Note: I'm back on it after trial & error and a horrid, hellacious divorce). Good luck!",1
"You asked about Cymbalta   & everyone gives you all this other advice, bless them...anyway...cymbalta has helped me a lot. Be aware, however, that coming off of is horrid. Ive never done hard drugs but it was what I imagined it was like to come off heroin, and anyone else who has come off it can tell you the same. This also means that if I miss a dose, I feel it (brain zaps, nausea, faint). Best of luck to you!! May you feel better very soon.",1
Unfortunately some times it's the only way. Chin up things will get better.. talk about ptsd meds there a blood pressure med helps sometimes.,1
"Prayer about how you are feeling really helped me, and reading the Bible.  Psalms are good to read through life's ups and deep downs.  David went through horrible trauma's and he kept on believing and praying to and trusting in God.  It helps us to do so too.  The gospels, especially the book of John is really God's love letter to us sent through Jesus.",1
"I agree with Eric that it is difficult to get off Clonipin. If felt like I needed more and more, till I was taking 3 mg a day. It took me 7 months to reduce the dose to 1/2 a mg in the morning. My Dad recently passed away so I went back up on the dose but am now weaning my self off it again. Do we ever not need a crutch in times of high anxiety? I don't know how ""normal"" people do it.",1
Oh I know Eric Grace. I was on Xanax for years and years and was put on Klonopin instead. It helps ALOT with my Anxiety though. And it helps me sleep at night.,1
"You have had a traumatic experience and there is another way to look at it.  You can choose to reframe it and give thanks for your survival.  You can thank the Lord for surviving, and come to Him for healing.  You may need the meds, to help you get through it, but time passes.  I can only say this because I had some pretty bad things happen to me that made me really anxious with panic attacks and sky high generalized anxiety that made it really hard to work and do just about everything.  I really wish I had taken meds a lot earlier in my life.  While time goes on, you do heal.  When I was at my worse I had a saying that I told myself.  I used to tell myself that ""things would not always be this way"", and that ""tomorrow was another day! "" I liked another saying that was, "" every day is a new beginning.""  This gave me the knowledge that as bad as a day got, I could hope for better tomorrows.",1
"Cymbalta was hell for me. Increases anxiety times a million, body aches, very panicky.... tried giving it a chance to work but it didn't, and coming off of it was worse. After a few days off of it, I felt so relieved and much better. I've heard the opposite for other people- some say it's great.   ",1
"The different types of Cannabis work for different   ailments.  Indica, Sativa, Hybrids etc. Have to do your research.  I have used it for anxiety (indica) I do not use sativas cause they can make me have panic attacks. Hybrids are the varieties, thats when you need to know names of Cannabis and what they do to your mind, body. I take Psych meds but have decreased so much that I rely on Cannabis for pain management as well.",1

Things will change / get better. Maybe the medication takes time. Try rest/ do things you enjoy when you feel up to it. Stay away from stress/ stressful ppl as much as possible. Do a little more each day. I know it's hard but many of us have been through similar stuff so you have to remember things will get beta. Pray to God if you want x,1

Your children need you so much I'm sure.  Your loved ones need you, do they realise how bad things are for you?

I remember feeling that I couldn't go on that I needed an escape from the torment, but it's not the answer, there is a better way, it's just finding the way.

"I know exactly how you feel. I was diagnosed with bipolar 10 years ago but suffered from depression/anxiety for years before that. I'm also very lonely as when you can't work for more years than you care to remember the friends you thought would always stand by you move on and don't care about you anymore. I understand to a certain extent but surely the odd phone call wouldn't hurt. But know, i consider myself to be a decent caring person and would never do that to them. Just a phone call but i don't even know a few of there numbers and they don't seem to want to give me them even if I've asked on Xmas cards. I'm not out to ruin there lives and I know I should move on. But it's a lonely life when for a while I've been in and out of the local psychiatric hospital, maybe they don't want to be associated with mental health. But maybe one day you just don't know it could happen to them. I think I've made friends from hospital but they don't keep in touch either, I know they are ill too but if you're kind hearted I've been taken for a mug quite a few times eg lending money you never get back. Having jewellery stolen and trusting an alcoholic who charmed me to the tune £4000. Yes I got to like him even although I'm a married woman but my husband is not cuddly or complementary and this guy knew how to get me to furnish his house, buy clothes, cigarettes and even a washing machine. There was no sexual relationship but if he'd wanted to I think I'd have been up for it and I know that seems terrible as I've been married for 34 years but we were going through a bad patch. Eventually he didn't get in touch and like a little boy was scared he had a girl friend. What I hated most was the way he lied to me texting me saying we must go out for dinner me paying of course when he had no intention of meeting me. I was really hurt and even now my marriage isn't a bed of roses as he lost his job and 8 months later is still looking so you can imagine the atmosphere in the house. Also we don't have much in common apart from 2 lovely children. There is hardly any conversation. Now I know a lot of you would say split up and many times i want to but I've never lived on my own ever and don't think iam strong enough to go through with it. Not sure what will happen but just have to put up with it for now. Sorry for the rant but apart from the Samaritans this helps me get it out of my system for a little while. X",1
"I think the majority of us with bpd self isolate. Sometimes, it is just easier than going out and feeling anti social.

"As u can see, we all go thru this. I have bpd, anxiety & panic attacks. I lost my 28 year old son. It magnified it all for me. I stayed in bed for a year, attempted suicide 3 x's. My 1 other son busted my door down & told me u've always been the strongest woman I've known. It's not fair that i lost my brother & my mom the same day. I felt like i was letting him down like i did Rob. I didn't right away just jump out of bed, it was a long process, but it starts with 1 small step. I wish u the best, & hope u hear all of us. Ur not alone",1
"I hope you're in therapy for BPD.  I know someone very close to me who has this diagnosis and it's absolutely awful for them without their therapy.  With their therapy, they're doing a LOT better and they're happier generally.  They're using DBT.  DBT has some positive results for people with BPD.  If you are in therapy for it already, it may take some time before you see good results. Just don't give up on it...or on yourself!  

You said you push everyone away, but that you're extremely lonely.  Have you tried being honest with the people in your life?  Tell them your diagnosis and what that means...and that you DO want them in your life.  You NEED them, but you're afraid of being betrayed, hurt, let down, abandoned or whatever other issue you may be feeling?  I'm willing to bet that some of them would try to understand and be more likely to help you with your concerns.  People who care for you and love you will try to be there for you.  You just have to let them.  

My best wishes are with you.  Please don't give up.",1
"Hi there.  Sounds as tho things are really pretty bad for you at the moment.  It must be so tough.  There are so many hideous feelings having a mental illness can bring, but one of them, the incessant worrying, ruminating, analysing must be one of the worst, it never seems to stop unless you are lucky enough to have the respite of sleep, if it comes.

The torment can feel so great, it can be exhausting, all encompassing and at times debilitating.

Having anxiety and depression can often go hand in hand as one can bring on or worsen the other.

Pushing people away can be for many reasons as you suggest, but of course it can also be counter productive.  Having a mental health problem can make you feel very alone and when you need people the most you can go to any lengths to almost hide from people.

These might all be very common traits, but knowing that might not actually help of course.

You describe that you have been recently diagnosed as having bipolar, but I'm wondering if you have any further support (professional) in light of this diagnosis, have you been prescribed any medication to help or do you have access to any other support e.g. Charities, counselling etc? 

You have clearly been suffering a long time, so it worries me in case you aren't getting the best help, but am unsure where you are and therefore which help might be out there.  In the U.K. The samaritans are a very good point of contact for support, but not sure if you are in the US.

It's a good thing you have reached out here and there are many caring soles here who understand.  Understanding, kindness and consideration can really make the difference when you feel so alone.

Take good care of yourself, try to reach out to those who you love x",1

Trouble is my wife gives 100 per cent of herself into all her relationships and we all abuse her kind good nature and when she gets ill or angry, where are we still expecting for her to be supporting us, we the selfish ones. When she does breakdown, no one calls no one stops and values her me included and why should she put up with it.

I haven't worked since November of last year. We lost our home and had to move with my parents... My hubby and two kiddos. Work is extremely stressful and anxiety provoking. I have PTSD from work. I applied for SSDI. I am waiting my decision to see if we need to appeal,1
My anxiety is so bad I do isolate myself,1
"Anxiety is preventing me from work most times. Not many understands that. Not physically lazy at all, I lose interest really fast.",1
"I went through this when I first started my job, it did last about 2 years you may be different. but eventually it does go away. It is important that you take your medication even if you do feel well, like you I hear voices if I don't take my meds. The anxiety is just another aspect of your illness, so you need to take your meds. Just to let you know I've been in my job for 18 years you can do this to. Without your medication you are very much on an edge and could trip over at any time. The anxiety your feeling about working is because it's new and unknown, don't leave yourself vulnerable without your medication.   ",1
I hear you. Work is a major stressor for a lot of people with mental health issues. What I've learned is stay in the moment and practice mindfulness. Stay focused at the task at hand. If anxiety strikes go to the bathroom to remove yourself from the situation and breathe for a few minutes. It's hard I understand I work part time and its a problem for me too dealing with anxiety that work triggers . You must tell yourself that you know exactly what you doing. You are also a valuable employee . It's so difficult feeling with others in the workplace . Keep to yourself stay focused and do your best. And if you panic in front of others don't worry it won't be the end of the world. Everyone has anxiety at one time or another. But it's hard. Hang in there. Think of the money and the worse anxiety of being unemployed. Repeat to yourself this feeling will pass and move on in the moment ..... Xxxx,1
This is no way to live.  Your depressive disorder is a disease.  Just like having high blood pressure and refusing to take the medicine to control it.  Your medications do what your body is unable to do for itself.,1

Lucy McGowan thank you! I have been in counseling since I was 12. It helps but not the same as having another that has been through similar situation.Yea my jobs used to last 6 months at the most and then I'd quit!!! As I have gotten older the anxiety has gotten worse .I try to deal with it the best I can but sometimes it gets the best of me!!!,1
"I'm so sorry you feel that way, no one should live with constant fear and anxiety. Counseling helps, I hope you can get the help you need.",1
"I don't know what the answer for you is at this point in your life, but I know that meds can help a lot with anxiety.  The problem is, we need a certain amount of anxiety to spur us onward.....but too much anxiety can make your job a whole lot harder.  That stress sure can wear you out.  It can damage your body and mind.  PRAY is what I do.  I used to pray before work.  I used to say to God, ""I know that nothing is going to happen today that you and I can't handle together""  Some people won't believe this but God tells me to trust him.  Prayer helps us with wisdom.  We can ask for strength, and for wisdom, and power to get through the anxiety.  I have a Bible Verse for you. 2 Timothy  6  ""Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. 7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.  The gift he spoke of was prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit.......it is worth asking for.  It is evidence that the Holy Spirit dwells in a believer in Christ.  It gives power spiritually to live a Christian life and to have faith.  Ask God for all these things......  Go to a full gospel church.  Maybe you won't like me talking about faith, but God can heal us if we trust Him.  It can take time.  Medication is something to pray about too.  If you can, attend a church or ministry where people pray for one another to get free of spiritual illness.  Once a woman prayed for me when I was really depressed, and God touched me and totally lifted my depression and I had a great peace.  Some people have the gift of praying for people and the people get healed.",1
I know I'm on rispedidol for hallucinations the comes with the depression. But I'm not on anything for anxiety.,1

"MDD-major depressive disorder. 

And ironically depression and anxiety tend to go hand in hand.",1
Your anxiety is because you have put your body in danger. Never stop your meds. Please rethink this choice,1
Its safe to say you're not ok and you need to take your meds. Anxiety wont just go away without the aid of medication.,1
"I absolutely understand where your coming from. Your definitely not alone in this one.

There are very few people that I actually make calls to regularly & it's because they are dealing with similar issues to me so they understand me & I find them not only easy to talk to, but they're a huge support (we are supportive to each other). Anyone else I speak to on the phone either call me, or I'm calling them back. They all understand this is how I am & how I need it to be.

I think the main reason I'm not good at calling people is the fact that it's exhausting! 
Having to explain how I am, what I've been up to (if I can even remember), what treatments I'm currently having (meds etc), if it's all working for me & what my doctor thinks or says? Sometimes they just want to know everything & it's tiring!
Also knowing that some of the people I'm speaking to don't really understand what I'm dealing with, can be frustrating but still I have to remember that they are trying, they're making an effort, they want to keep in contact because they are trying to understand & they care, I have to remember that it's a good thing & I do have to acknowledge, respect & love them for that.

Sometimes I do just text them a short message though. It's easier for me when I'm not feeling my best & I can control the details that I want to go into. They've learned to accept this about me & I guess any contact is better than no contact right?

In the end, for me there's no right or wrong way when it comes to contacting my family members & friends.
I need to feel comfortable & somewhat understood by the people I'm speaking to & they need to understand that sometimes I don't want to talk about my issues. I'll just quickly let them know how I'm doing & that now I'd rather talk about something else. 

Our world doesn't have to constantly revolve around our illness, especially when we're speaking to family just because we feel it's expected. Sometimes it's nice to have a conversation that doesn't involve my illness.

I really hope that I've helped you & not confused you further.",1

Surely you can have joint access at least to your son?

I hope you have good and appropriate professional support to help you.  Could they help with some sleeping tablets to help in the short term? Having no sleep can make everything so much harder, just for a temporary measure?

I'm not sure how old your son is, but whatever age, he needs his mum and he needs her well and happy.  I hope you can find the strength to beat this for him and for yourself.

I was nervous of going down the stairs when I was consciously awake, so this really scared me! So I stopped using it, for fear I might be one that would drive & not be aware! (I did feel rested after I awoke though!)
Tried taking  Belsomra, and although I didn't have same side-effect, it wired me up so bad, my eyes wouldn't even stay closed!
Now I am back to taking Xanax (0.5mg) when I cannot sleep.",1
I will not let anyone put me on ambien. My mom was on ambien and she was a zombie! She would  hallucinate things and would do things and have no memory of doing it! And she was completely addicted to it. After watching her horror i am scared of that stuff!!,1
"I've taken for yrs. yes if you take it and watch tv or read, etc. then you end up walking snacking, cleaning, etc. but in my case I had but  know what I'm doing at the time. Do found I've done nothing out of my character. Just more obsessed with eating or cleaning! Next morning I may have forgotten in morning, but do remember with prodding. 
You must go to bed, take it, close your eyes and go to sleep. Nothing else. 
My husband swears it won't work unless he takes it 1/2 hour before. Uuuuggg! 
I've had to tell him ""!Go to bed!"" He's ate a whole bag of popcycles in bed! 
Or try and hold a conversation with others. 
So as it works for some with no side effects, not so hot for others. 
We're all different chemically. It will effect differently. 
Unfortunately I have ALS. I need it to sleep and it works. 
But take it and IMMEDIATELY GO TO SLEEP. 
If you have trouble STOP!",1
"I've been taking ambien for a long time now. So I guess I have worked through a lot of the odd things. Yes you will forget things you did, sometimes the stuff you did shortly before you took it too. It gives me the munchies too. It's almost amusing when you find out what you ate last night, sucks when it hits hard and you have a glass of milk in your hand, I never seem to forget that feeling, ever. I don't sleep, I don't get tired, I was wide awake at 2am last night still, and am back up at 7am. I'm not currently manic either, this is me. But without help with sleep, I won't sleep at all and the mania comes on to scary levels.",1
"Ambien saved my life. I was sleeping maybe an hour a night and my health and mental health deteriorated drastically. Yes I finally went to sleep and I slept for 24 hours straight. But once I'd been taking it for about a month it  regulated, and I wasn't sleeping all the time or tired anymore. 
But these other ladies are right ""sleep"" walking, driving,  eating and sex really does happen on it. For me it was worth it. I don't take it anymore and you can become dependant on it and that's not pretty for about a week after stopping. I had severe panic attacks when I stopped taking it.",1
"I took Ambien and would wake up and do things I couldn't remember the next day, it was really scary, honestly I would take something different.",1
Ambien is the devil. Did stuff without remembering. Horrible. I will never take it again. Eventually I had to have my then 9 year old start hiding my keys at night.,1
When I was on it I felt the same way. Like a constant state of zombieness. I ended up getting off of it because it made my anxiety bad but I took half of what he prescribed me. It still helped me fall asleep but I didn't feel like the walking dead the next day.,1
"To help counter this problem, my Dr. Prescribed memory medication that is often used for mild alheimers (can't spell that) and dementia. His reasoning is that some of my other meds like mood stabilizer and anxiety meds may also be part of the memory problem.",1
"Meds can take normal emotions away.  It is normal to have some moods.  This is what I believe.  We are all sinners, and God sent Jesus to save us from our sins.  If we walk with God, he walks with us and he challenges us to become like Him but he miraculously rescues us out of our sins by daily filling us with himself in the person of the Holy Spirit.  When we repent of sin God hears us and helps us.   A Christian live is all about relationship to God through Christ, a daily life of prayer, and viewing our personal life through the what the Bible says.  We can change.  Some meds make us less caring and compassionate.  They can take our motivation away.  Our mental illnesses can make us irritable and uncaring too.  What I am doing these days is praying to see people through God's eyes.  I know that God sees us all through eyes of love and understanding.  He is for us.  Sometimes we just have to do the right things and trust God to give us the strength and the love to go with it.  God knows the motivations of the heart.  Give thanks for what you do right.  Feel good about every victory in becoming the person you want to become.  Our hearts long for God and our hearts long for true caring relationships.  It takes effort these days to be a good neighbor.  We all live more isolated lives than people did one hundred years ago.  It takes effort to be outgoing and giving.  You can't do it all, but we each can be giving in some way.  Some people have all they can handle trying to be good to their family.",1
I have bipolar border line personality disorder and n other conditions anxiety depression insomnia etc I smoke weed daily it really helps me stay calm n my mind dosent wander as much best medicine I'm on,1
I'm the same way but also as well as dealing with bpd depression anxiety and suicidal ideation. Just life. We deal with what we get,1
"Bipolar, antisocial caused by anxiety, hyper emotional, manic depression, manipulative, loving my children dont care for others have a hard time showing emotion. No meds. Weed. Used to help in the beginning now it really just calms the anxiety, panic attacks and the hyper emotional.",1
"As long as it works for you,who's anybody to say differently?Weed works for my bipolar bf!Not so much for me,though.I mean,it does calm me down,yes,but does it take my depression away??Not always.Does it take my anxiety away?Sometimes,but sometimes it actually makes it worse.So Im forced to still take my Geodon,Trilleptal,Zoloft,Klonopin, and Ambien,everyday,til I die.",1
"I manipulate. Have all my life. Bipolar and anxiety. I was only girl in my family among 6 grandkids. The youngest,  spoiled. I have to gave my way. I do feel love, I over love. Part of OCD...",1
"That drug saved me. I have Bipolar, depression, anxiety, and sleep problems. And taking zyprexa, I've been able to fall asleep within an hour of taking it an actually sleep through the night and wake up rested. I didn't get mood swings, and my depression was better. Highly recommend.",1
"It was literally a life saver for me. I had gone 2 years with only 8 hours of sleep per month. My body was shutting down. It did make me sleep. Zyprexa is an anti-psychotic med. They have had to put me on it a couple of times when manic or experiencing psychosis.
If you feel like a zombie. The dose is too high. I won't even mention how much weight I gained. There was no other options for me. I'd say I have a love hate relationship with Zyprexa.
When they took me off of it. I still had some pills left. This is probably bad advice, but when life becomes too overwhelming. If I don't have to be anywhere the next day. I will take about half a pill for ONE night. I'm a zombie the next day, but its like it resets me. No dr ever recommended doing this & I'm pretty sure my dr would tell me not to do it. Yet, its kept me from killing myself more times than I can count.",1
"I gained about 50 lbs with the zyprexa melt away. It did help a little, but the restless legs, constipation and headaches,along with the weight gain made it not worth it to me. It's weight I can't get off too.",1
Those people that do that are more insecure than the person they are joking about .. it's a defense mechanism.,1
Everyday. People will use my insecurities to their advantage.,1
such a life sit try figure if take right amount of sleeping pills to sleep to feel better or take all the sleeping pills and never worry about feeling ever again,1
"My boyfriend doesn't understand how hard it is to have a mental condition. He says ""it's all in your head"". Yes it is all in my head but not like that. He don't get how it hurts everything inside me. The stress of going to the store when I'm feeling off. How sometimes my body don't feel like its mine. Which is so weird to be disconnected from yourself. He will never understand it because 1. He don't have it 2. He's an ass.",1
So TRUE... People need to know more about this Problem...and stop to think that we are all human..and we have feelings..just at times alot stronger and confusing...  ,1
I suffer with post traumatic stress disorder and on a lot of medication but I have get on the best I can don't ask for sympathy and i don't give it,1
"I know I'm not theone that wrote that, but some of what was stated is exactly what I'm going thru. I've been on meds since the end of Jan- first part of Feb of this year. I went to jail for discipling my child and since then I've been without a job which is stressful, living with my mom who gives into my sons every whimper. I know I can't give up because of my son but what do you do when you have no one in the home that is willing to talk to you? When you are so angry that you blame God for putting you thru all of this stress? I have suicidal thoughts several times a day, especially when my son pushes my buttons and then when I yell he tells me he wants me to die. It is very hard, but trust me going to a place once a week at a church will help. I've started going to a group that is mainly for addicts art a church and I've been getting more and more into reading the Bible and trying not to yell as much when he pushes my buttons. Whoever this Anonymous person is, if you would like to reach out for someone to talk to, please feel free to send me a private message.",1
"You know that you have to go to a therapist and tell the therapist all this, but you also know that GOD CARES.  Seek Him again every day.  Know that He is there for you, have confidence in Him.  Eat a good diet and have some things in your life that make you happy.  Forget about what people might think of you.  It absolutely does not matter.  What matters is that God loves you so completely and totally, He never leaves you, and you are going to get through this.  This is a tough time of your life.  You need to take care of yourself.  You have to have some friends.  You can go to a support group with Nami, or a peer support group.  You can invite someone over for coffee and chose to ignore your fearful feelings.  You can go for a walk someplace pretty.  You can read the Bible and you can tell yourself positive truths.  You can put on some uplifting music and do some art work, or crochet or knit.  You have to have things to look forward to!  I am really getting into growing things.  I have stuff on my apartment patio.  I spent money on good organic potting soil.  If I did not have a patio I would get really cheap succulent plants and propagate them.  You can take parts of one plant and get a lot of other plants to grow.  It gives you something to look forward to.  I have some cats, and kitties cuddling is really nice when you are single.  As far as the family accepting you, make it clear that you are glad you are part of their family.  Call them up and ask how they are.  Try to call at good times for them.  It is worth the effort.  My oldest sister always acted like I was bothering her when I called because she was always busy and irritable and sick.  I knew she wasn't feeling well.  I think if you call family that you want to know better you will get to know them better.  Ask some of them over for cake and coffee, lunch, or dinner.  God to church and meet some nice people.  Don't feel self conscious meeting people.  You don't have to like all the people and they don't all have to like you, but you will make some friends if you continue to go.  If one church does not work out, try another and another.  The library has ways to meet other Mom's.  Also kids sport events. We can have horrible pasts and God can heal us and make us strong.  I know that this is true because I am 61 and I lived through a lot of horrible times, like you did.  Try to be there for your kids the way you wished someone had been there for you as a kid.  DO stuff with your kids and don't let yourself pull away from them.  They need you.  Play games with them, go out with them, it raises your spirits, but moderation in all things.  You need to rest.  Get a good physical too, as sometimes it is physical illness that zaps our energy and makes us depressed.  HAVE FAITH THAT THINGS WILL GET BETTER.  Do what you can to make them better.  Keep in touch with the son who stays with family.  Don't let that break your heart, maintain contact and let him know you love him and you are there for him on a regular basis.",1
Read the last thing you wrote? Your kids. You had a really tough life and I see where that has had a huge impact . I had a shitty childhood too. Such traumas can cause us go through life with negative self talk. And fear. Mindfulness is very helpful,1
How is it possible you don't see how amazing it is you lived thru everything you dealt with growing up? Your story is amazing and I'm sure could help someone else struggling. Have you ever thought about using your experiences to help others ? It might help heal you in the process of giving you some self-worth. There are lots of support groups you could join. You've made it so far don't give up!! God is preparing you for greatness. Keep praying but get involved with some support groups to help you continue to heal.,1
Yes it is horrible. Get off this post Philtazsimmons Taz or keep your mouth shut.,1
Wtf? That's horrible to say.,1
"I'm sorry to hear you feel this way. 
You know it's the illness making you feel this way, there is a bit of sensibility and logic in what you've written so somewhere in the background you very much want to fight this. I want to ask do you take any medication for your condition? Do you ever see a doctor. 

Please don't think that people are waiting for you to die, they're not. This is very much the illness, And you have to be strong against it. With the right medication, you can have a normal life. Just as an example, I have had mental health problems all my life, and I've been on lithium duLoxitane, and amisulpride these drugs of help me maintain a normal life and I've been in my job for 18 years. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and bipolar 27 years ago. Please do not give up hope, please push the paranoid thoughts away, and if you're not on meds try and see a doctor. Your worth it. You are in my thoughts.     ",1
"YOU ARE LOVED! If no one else is going to say it, I will. I love you. I love you for reaching out. I love you for sharing. I love you for saying something before you did something irreversible. 
The best metaphor I've ever heard was about a man having a conversation with God. He didn't want to go on, he was tired, he just wanted to find rest...he couldn't make it another day...he couldn't even make it until that night...and God asked ""can you make it to the kitchen? Eat breakfast then we will see how you feel"" don't think of handling the pain in days or even hours...can you make it a few more minuets? ...yes, you can...even if it's the most grueling and vulnerable moments...you made it through this post, you can make it through the comments...just one more comment...one more person telling you how loved you are. 

You are loved. 
You are important.
You are needed. 
Please stay...",1
These feelings are symptoms not truth. And God is the one person who never has any bad feelings about you. Ever. His approval of you doesn't have conditions. That's the kind of love you probly never experienced either. I don't know if you have a counselor but they do help. They are the steady person when we are in chaos and they understand the struggle more than most people.,1

I tried therapy and my anxiety and depression spiraled out of control and told my psychiatrist and she didnt offer a way to deal with it. And i was in & out of the er from having panic attacks even after taking the meds and the er & my pcp told me my meds needed to be increased and she didnt want to hear that either so what do i do,1

"Hi there.  Sounds as though things have been dreadful for you of late.  

I guess to try to answer some of those questions; I'd need to ask some of my own.

I'm wondering first if you now live on your own? 

Do you have people around to support you?

Do you still have close family around and you talked about your mum originally?

Do you have any professional support?

Are you taking any medication?

Sorry for the questions, but I don't want to suggest anything which might offend or hurt.

It probably won't help to read this, but most of the feelings you describe sound very familiar and common with mental health problems. These extreme feelings which of course are worrying and real.  

I'm wondering if you have left home and gone away to study? Has your support network gone? If you are at college or university (forgive me for the terminology as I'm thinking you could be in the US and I'm in the UK) is there any support at your place of study?

We can be so unkind to ourselves when we are suffering.  We can blame ourselves when it is all beyond our control.  

Are there any wellbeing courses or workshops you can access? 

The road to recovery involves several things which when you are in the midst of the turmoil can appear to be too much of a mountain to climb, but it is possible and usually involves small, but significant achievable steps, but we need to lean on people and we need people who can support us.

 Reaching out to people on these sites is a really good first step, explaining how you feel xx",1
"Sandra Bowman Benzos r indicated for the treatment of anxiety. And, no they won't kill u",1
"I'm skeptical that ur psychiatric provider will prescribe benzos for u if u have a history of abusing substances. Let me share my situation. I also suffer from severe anxiety. I have taken Xanax (alprazolam) in the past for a total of 5 years. I started seeing a new psychiatrist last year. He treats patients with substance abuse disorders. As a result, he refuses to prescribe any benzos for me. However, they throw an Ambien prescription (10 mg) at me. I may consider changing physicians.",1
I need to go to beacon and pick up my results! I did one too. Didn't like the psych or the people in the office so I found another and never looked back. I'm struggling with meds now so I'm going to need to get those!,1
Tell them your concerns. I had issues with opiates in the past and I told them what I was worried about and what I was hoping to accomplish with meds. Great way to start looking for the right meds combo,1
"Alit of psychiatrists are trying to ween ppl off the benzos. One reason is bc they have a street value but the biggest reason is bc of the addiction. I have been on klonopins for 9 yrs now and its getting to where they arent working like they use to bc my body is use to them but even the with the problems i have my doc refuses to increase bc they have a street value. But after a whole year trying to find something for my panic/anxiety disorder, and ptsd that has been The only thing that helps and was the last medication i tried even after refusing the xanax i had no idea what klonopin was back then. What the doctor tries you out on is what u need to try before the benzos bc benzos can do permanent damage when coming off of them. Just be honest about whats going on with you and discuss the medication they are offering.",1
"I have anxiety, depression, bipolar, agoraphobia and panic attacks. I am on Zoloft for my anxiety and depression, which works good but keeps me awake at night. I take trileptal for bipolar and it works good and helps me sleep. I take ativan for panic attacks and I only use it as needed because it makes u feel like a zombie.",1
Work with your doctors. It has taking me years to find the right ones. Have someone you trust help you at your home life know what you are on and help you find the right you you want. The wrong douse can mess you up and others can help you. What works for others may not work for you. You will still feel depression and anxiety and that is normal. Just don't let it completely control you. That is why we all take our meds. Good luck. You are not alone in this battle. ;,1
"Make sure to ask about side effects. A lot of medications for mental illness cause weight gain, some even cause depression and anxiety, manic episodes, and Suicidal Thoughts. So no these don't happen to everyone, but it's good to know what may possibly happen.
A really bad one for weight gain is Seroquel, although it does help with sleep and moods... Apparently for many.  And something that I have come across and it was something really horrible called Akathesia... And I hope I'm explaining this correctly, not even sure I spelled it correctly, but it is a nerve disorder... Really the only way I can explain it is that it looks like you're having a seizure, your arms and legs move involuntarily... It's a horrible, horrible side effect of Latuda. Which made me sad, because Latuda really worked well for my bipolar depression. But like I said not everyone gets the side effects.",1
I take Gabapinten for anxiety (works so much better than Klonopin for me) and I take a tricyclic for depression (some uncomfortable side effects) but I can't tolerate any other type of depression meds.,1
Prudence Lowe Benjamin my doctor had me on all kinds of Medicine at one time but I've never heard of the benzos what is that for anxiety or for depression and why do you say it will kill you what is the side effects to it,1
"Clonazepam for panic attacks, effexor/venlafaxine for anxiety, mirtazapine for insomnia",1
"I have found SSRIs better for depression and anxiety. SNRIs tend to be good for depression but exacerbate anxiety... and tend to be more addictive... well that's my experience anyway ❤️ Best of luck, hope you feel better soon x",1
"Leave the meds to the psych.  Just tell all of your concerns of your illness. Anyone who walks in and starts asking for certain meds. sends an alarm off in the mind of your doctor.  That is what is called DRUG SEEKING BEHAVIOR.  The doctor is then more likely to REDUCE your meds no matter how much you may need them.  Once that type of behavior is marked down in your chart....well, you see the problem.",1
I second Beth- I would not go to the appointment asking for specific meds- I would talk to them about the symptoms you are experiencing and how they are affecting your life and ability to work and get along with family.  Benzos are a big deal- they are incredibly addictive- yes you feel better taking them but you will need more and more to get the same effect and that leads to addiction- please if the doctor declines to prescribe them do not feel they do not care about you- they are expressing care not prescribing them.  I love the effect of Klonopin but have decided they are just too dangerous for me to be taking as I abuse them- I do not wish to take an overdose due to not being able to keep track of my dosage.  I am on a non addictive medicine called Buspar for anxiety so there are other options besides benzos.,1
Be careful asking for advice on meds to take here. Everyone is different and what works for 1 won't necessarily work for you. It's a trial and error thing and something you must work closely with your dr on. It took me 18 mths to get the right combo. I can say one thing. Drs are reluctant to pres robe benzodiazepines because they lose their effect if used long term so you need more and more and they are addictive. Great for short term use but that's about it. Talk to your dr about cognitive behavioural therapy   It has been great for me as it has given me tools to help myself. I have bipolar I and anxiety disorder.,1
Me too. I'm on medication and in therapy to help manage my anxiety and major depression.,1
"Sometimes depression causes anxiety so maybe starting on an antidepressant would be best. Just tell them all your symptoms, your feelings, your questions, and your concerns. Tell them what your treatment goals are too",1
I've looked into both TMS & ECT. I've been told that TMS helps more with anxiety & depression but not other illnesses like bipolar.,1
"You cut because you are nervous and it relieves anxiety.  If you figure out what times you do it and what is going through your head when you do it, that will help.  It gives you some kind of satisfaction.  If you can find something else to do with your mind and your body at that time that is positive it might help.  Can you draw, crochet, or knit when you are feeling anxious like this.  If these things make you more nervous don't do them so long.",1
Try not to think about it that way bro. Think about the positives. I personally deal with the same kind of stuff. I scare myself. Thoughts of suicide every single minute of everyday. But I just try as much as I can to distract myself. And if I cant then I will admit I take it out on myself ( self harm ) but its better than the alternative. I'm here for you if you ever wanna just chat,1
"It sounds so dreadfully hard for you at this time.  It also sounds as though you ve been going through this turmoil for such a long time.  I wish I had all the answers.

I'm wondering how long you have been seeing your therapist and if you feel seeing them is helping.

You also state you are taking medication, but still feel as bad as this.  Have you been taking them for a long time and does your therapist feel they are the right tablets and the right dose as you are still struggling so much?

The only thing with trying to help and to feed back is the need to ask further questions, only just to try to think of things which might help.

You talk about the feelings you have to your wife.  I'm wondering how long you have been together, how supportive she is and I guess deep down how you feel about your relationship?

Can you remember the feelings you had when you first got together, what attracted you, can you recall some of those happy memories? That's a difficult one, only you can really come to the conclusion how you really feel.

Do you have any meaningful activities in your life? You didn't say whether you are able to work?

With regards to considering why you cut yourself, it's hard to say as luckily I have never done that, not that I didn't consider doing something and it's probably hard to remember the exact thoughts before and while you were doing it.  I remember the thoughts when I considered it, people have suggested probably already the main reasons people do it such as actually wanting to feel something as depression often makes you literally feel numb while at the same time your head can be in such a turmoil.

I'm wondering too if it can be the culmination of pent up anger, resentment and frustration when you can't escape the desperate situation you are in.  When there seems nothing you can do to escape other than if you are lucky; sleep sometimes, could this be a way of interrupting the cycle of over thinking and feeling dreadful?

Often I knew I wanted to escape.  I wasn't living, merely existing.  Whilst battling depression and anxiety day after day, the desire to 'be' somewhere else was immense, but it always seemed so illusive.  When we crave contentment and peace, the happy lives so many seem to have, then occasionally death might seep into our thoughts as a better alternative to the sh*t we are always feeling.

I knew, luckily that wasn't the answer and also I didn't want to not be here, I just didn't want to be 'there'. I guess what I'm trying to say is we so desperately want all this pain to end and sometimes ending it all seems to only solution.

Of course it's not, there is a better way, recovery and a better life is the way, the key, but to reach that can seem such a monumental task.

To get there unfortunately can take a long time, but it is possible and real, but you do need people to help, it's necessary to lean on people and to let them help.  Recovery relies on many things, some very small, but all important.

Are there any other agencies you can access? Charities? Peer support? Exercise is really good, but small, achievable and significant steps are key, goals are helpful, not huge goals, small ones, little steps, exercise can literally begin with just sitting in the sun, feeling the sun on your face, trying once again to feel the sensations of the weather around you, building up to perhaps a short walk and building up from there.

Of course I don't want to patronise and 'teach you to suck eggs' as they say over here, but just trying to remember the things which helped me on the road to better mental health.

Going back to the self harm, Im wondering sometimes it might also be wanting to actually feel something.  The illness and the drugs can leave you feeling nothing and inflicting pain on yourself will make you feel, it might also divert your thoughts from the pain you feel inside your head to the actual physical pain?

It is so hard to put into words what I thought when I considered it, I felt as though I wanted to punish myself in some way that was payback for not being able to beat this hideous illness.  I think I felt a failure and weak in some way that the depression was winning and I wasn't strong enough to control it, it was controlling me and why wasn't I able to fight this off and get better? Also I hated being so self centred.  With depression I felt I spent all my days going over and over the past, reliving awful things that had happened and just wallowing in self pity.  I hated it, that's not me, I'm not selfish, but I couldn't stop it, was self hard a way of hurting myself? Did I deserve to be punished? Of course I didn't, but I couldn't see it at the time.  We can be so hard on ourselves.  

Mental illness is so hard when we have such conflicting emotions and having the strength to recover just alludes us when we need it most.

So sorry to run on so, just trying to really think if there is anything which you might be able to relate to.

A healthy diet and trying to introduce things to give your life meaning are very important.  I know it can be hard when sometimes it's not even possible to get out of bed, but you have done so well in admitting things and getting help.  The desire to get better is the key.  

There is a better way, recovery and inner peace is possible, but it takes time, we must try so hard for ourselves, we owe it to ourselves to beat this and to our loved ones, best wishes, always here x",1
"I'm a recovering self harmer. One of the things that helped me was when I wanted to cut I would squeeze ice cubes. This sounds stupid but wait! Squeezing releases that stress and there is a bit of pain that comes from the coldness of the ice. It has been a long, hard road. This did not always work but sometimes it did. I hope this helps someone.",1
I am sorry you're going through that I myself am going through the same thing I have been off and on medications for years now I've also been placed in hospital our story is pretty similar sometimes we don't realize what we do because we have panic attacks we feel a loss of Hope that no one cares and you feel like you want to give up on life that's how I felt and sometimes I feel that way often still so I hope you get treatment and hope everything goes well with you,1
i know it costs money any goes against many beliefs but getting tattoos is better than cutting... my bf is 100% against tattoos so i haven't gotten one yet and it's embarrassing my scars from the past...I used to cut as it would drown out the pain iIwas feeling at the time.,1

My goodness. I understand and find myself in a dark place. I have to say that I am worried for you....I believe that you need to go to your nearest emergency department. Don't think about it just pack a toothbrush and go. You are loved you are needed your are more than enough. Tell yourself.  Remember that we are all here,1
"Dont say that, you have come so far which just goes to show you how very strong you are. When you suffer with a mental illness eachday,  hour, minute can be a struggle. Do you have support?

And thats okay, they love the entire you, bad and good. Please stay strong, fight and keep pushing through",1

"The Lamictal rash can progress to Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which is life-threatening, so you did the right thing stopping the med, but you still should have seen a doctor at the onset of the rash. Notify your prescriber ASAP and get to the first MD you can see - urgent care or ER or whatever. Blistering/peeling skin can be a sign of SJS. Did you/do you have flu-like symptoms, too?",1
You're supposed to start on the lowest dose and slowly start to go up to avoid the rain. It is a symptom that makes you basically allergic to your own skin. Your doctor should have informed you of this and told you to send him a picture of the rain immediately when it appeared to determine if it was from the medication. You did the right thing to stop it. If you stopped it soon enough it should subside.,1
Go to your Dr. as soon as possible and let them know about it. Not trying to scare you but the rash can cause death.,1
The world has turned its back on me. I'm only guilty of merely existing.,1
If your anxiety is the innate Generalized Anxiety Disorder (free-floating anxiety) type you can blame gene SLC6A4 which codes for anxiety related disorder,1

I have depression/anxiety and BPD. I personally found medication to not help, but it's about what works for you.
I like to take a bath to calm myself or try turn my anxiety into something useful by keeping busy, be it cleaning, getting out and taking the dog for a walk or playing with my daughter. I have a few close friends who know and it helps to have their support and understanding.

"Stay strong, and baby steps. My anxiety sometimes makes it hard for me to do things too. My friends are very protective of me and know about my struggles. They always are willing to just be my safe person and when introducing me to new people help me to not shut down.",1
You sound like I do when my anxiety gets me. I also suffer from depression so it's a double douse of crap. I had CAT back in 2014 because of it and I'm currently having some sessions now. After the first full programme I felt 'normal' I no longer felt trapped or numb as I was able to speak about what was actually going on in my head instead of tiptoeing around it in fear that people would think I'm crazy. But point is about 2 yrs later I found the courage to go travelling around Aus on my own for a year. I've only gone back to counselling as I recently lost my grandad and I have taken it quite hard. But I'm currently in Madrid where I flew by myself. I really don't mean this as bragging just as away of showing that it can be done   ,1
"As you probably know by now, you are not alone.  Reading this made my chest cave a bit and a hotness run through my body. What you just described was me all week last week. They can teach us how to control our breathing all day, but they have yet to teach me how to stop the uncomfortable heart beats, the numbness in my hands, the sickness in my stomach and the tears that just want to roll down. If ever you need someone to talk to in the midst of these small (or large) episodes, I am here to hear you out. Do small things for yourself hun, even a small dry erase note to yourself on the mirror can give you hope to push through the day. I have a huge collection of notebooks that I never use, but just thinking of what I can put in them makes me happy. I painted a ceramic cupcake with my daughter in the midst of my small attack (She has no idea what I go through. I've made it a point to myself I would never let her see my struggle) and that alone helped me relax a bit. Tiny things babe. We will all push through this together.",1

Yes I'm the one who wrote this I get feelings about dying it scares me .,1
"Hi there, I just wanted to let you know that it really is possible for you to get past some of these things.  I've had anxiety (& depression) since I was 17, & I'm 45 now.  From there to here has been hell a lot, but there have been, and continues to be, good times too.  I'm not saying it's easy to make it through tough times, and right now it sounds like a really, really horrible time for you, and I'm so sorry that you are going through this.

May I ask, do you have a psychologist and psychiatrist, and are you on any meds?  (I have to say that when I was your age and younger, I hated taking medications and I pretty much refuse to, which led to a lot of horrible circumstances.)

Next thing that I would like to ask you, is if you have any support common like family members or friends? (Personally, I have given up telling family members about my diagnosis because they just don't understand and or they just don't care), but I am hoping you have somebody that you can confide in.

I have to apologize, for this incredibly long message. I wanted to tell you just one more thing. When you talk about getting out of your house and going to stores or going out with friends or you don't to have fun, I used to have one friend who would slowly take me into the stores... Like we would go to the parking lot and just sit there and we did that a couple of times until I felt okay and the panic attacks subsided. And then we would start walking toward the door. Let's just say anxiety overload, but we did that several times until, again, I was feeling okay about it. And then we walked into the door and pretty much stood right inside the door, once again, several several times. And then the next step was to walk around the store. There is a name for this, but I don't remember what it is I can't think of the name of this technique. I know that not everything works for everybody, but maybe you have someone who could do that for and with you? If you do, try it.

Like I said before, I'm sorry that you're going through this. But if you allow yourself to just have a calming of some sort, and I don't like to make promises, but I I really do want to say to you, then I promise this will pass. But you need all the help you can get. Talk to me anytime privately if you'd like. Don't think that I am always so strong... The majority of my days are hard as hell, and sometimes, okay, put a smile on your face, most times we need help. And sometimes that help isn't right next to us... Sometimes it is via the Internet. :-) oh! Another thing I wanted to say was be good to yourself. We who have mental illnesses tend to do and be everything for everyone else and we forget about ourselves. Pamper yourself. Take a bubble bath or get your nails done. Read a good book or watch a movie. Anyway, again I am so sorry for the long ass message, and if you see errors in my message, it is because I voice text (I have hand tremors from one of my medications) and a lot of times my cell phone's wants to say things in another language or just say really weird words and whatnot. I hope you're feeling a slight bit better... Okay:-) I will leave you alone for now. :-)",1

I am in multiple support groups 4 mental illnesses, and a lot of times I see people who post don't have much support from the people they know personally, such as myself.

However, I believe that anxiety is included as a diagnostic criteria for Bipolar disorder. I believe that ALOT of members of these support communities tend to fixate on their multiple diagnoses.......I have Bipolar, GAD, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, etc. Mania and depression must coexist in order for the Bipolar diagnostic criteria to be satisfied.

In contrast, the Bipolar Support Group is closed.",1

But for me I had to get to a point where I had to take control, I had to find someone to talk to and explain my feelings. Try to pin point what is triggering your anxiety. Is it social media, is it the news, is it the outside noise? I know it's not easy, I'm in a hard place as well right now, but we have to try to keep moving forward.

"Hi.  It sounds as though you have been through so much it isn't surprising that you are struggling.  Having cancer and having to undergo chemo must have been gruelling enough on its own.  I know it can be terrible.  It sounds as though you have done so well.

Coming out the other side so to speak in a sense should be easier, but it might be a time when you start to relax, i.e. It might not feel such a fight, but also your goal has been achieved to get through all that so you might be sub consciously thinking; what now? What do I have to focus on?

Having depression/anxiety can be a very lonely place, it can be a mixture of feeling very alone, but also not doing things to engage and pushing people away, feeling no one cares.  Unfortunately people lead such busy lives for one reason or another.

Have you been able to talk to any of your family to explain how you feel? 

It sounds with the psychologist (not sure if that's the exact title, I can't refer back to your post whilst typing) that you really need someone you can have a two way dialogue with, I'm not sure by just talking 'at' someone will necessarily provide a full and satisfactory experience.  It's a bit of an odd form of communication when u receive very little feedback.

I'm sure others might suggest help and support from charities, but not sure how things like that work out where you are.  

Is there anyway you could become more involved with grandchildren? Please forgive me if I haven't all the facts, just trying to think of things which might help.

Trying to introduce enjoyable things, or activities with meaning often help.  Could you volunteer for a charity? Sometimes by helping others, this can help people to feel needed and worthy.

Small steps towards a bigger eventual goal are often key to getting better.  Having more things in life with meaning can help with self confidence, self esteem and having more things to focus on.

I know it's far from easy and it's important not to run before you can walk, but gradually trying to introduce a few new experiences might help long term.  Best wishes x",1
"Kids grow up and wonder away. Haven't seen my son in years. I struggle as well.

I'm on effexor: daily, lamictal: daily, rispiridone: as needed, daddy, for adhd, im also schizo- affective; every day can be a struggle, if I don't find something to keep me busy.
I go from the time I get up until I wear myself out; so I will sleep well. I walk my dogs, I go to support group meetings. Basically I keep myself busy, so that i don't have time to realize I'm alone and lonely: my dogs fill that gap or hollow place in me.

Cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness are key treatments in therapy. You can look these up on the net and gets some tips on things you can actively do to help yourself since you can't see a psychologist. You can get mindfulness apps for your phone to not only practice but to use when you are having an anxiety attack. The tools have been a godsend to me.,1

Do you have any family support?",1
I'm sorry about that. Glad you have disability. That helps take some worry away. Does your county offer any type of counseling?  Mine does and that's who prescribes my meds. I went to counseling for about 2 years and it helped. But I quit going last year. I'm tired of talking about my past. I'm trying to focus to my health and my life. I'm 50 years old and I speak from experience that it can get better.  I have a hard time with crowds over like 20 people. I go to church that is very small and most of the people are very elderly. That helps me because it helps my need to care for someone and I can be myself and they love me. I can relate to being 20 and having issues. You have my prayers and support.,1
"Yes with both zoloft and Mirtazapine (or any antidepressant really) .. made me 10000x worse. I was irritable, aggressive and really suicidal.

"You have to allow yourself to grieve, but keep taking care of yourself. Talking about it here or in any place you feel safe to is a good start. I got a dog a few years ago, and she changed my life for the better in more ways than I can describe. You're sad, and that's okay. Trust yourself to find another passion to get motivated about. Maybe reading to people in the hospital or nursing homes, or perhaps just dropping in to visit. Everybody needs encouragement and to know that someone cares. That goes for you, as well. Don't be afraid to ask for what you need. People that love you want to help, but usually don't know how.",1
"Hi there. So sorry to hear things are so difficult.  Phew you have a lot going on, no wonder you might be struggling.  Forgive me, but I'm uncertain if you are in the U.K. or US so not sure as to the support which is available to you.

Firstly a little around bereavement, loss and grief.  When someone has been a carer for any length of time, if the person they are caring for dies this can leave a huge void for the bereaved.  Not only can you grieve for them deeply, regardless of the relationship, but your whole purpose and role has disappeared overnight.  You provided such a valuable and worthwhile lifeline and service, which you knew helped so much, so when that's all gone it is perfectly feasible that you will literally feel redundant.

Personal loss in any form can leave the bereaved feeling lost, alone or abandoned.  Caring for someone as much as you did can   also mean the person left behind is just no longer needed.

Dealing with grief for anyone can be so hard, let along someone who may have other difficulties such as mental health problems. The impact can be far more severe.

Death is very hard to comprehend sometimes.  How can someone be there, so close one day and so far away the next? We need logic in our lives to understand and make any sense, death robs us of that.

Recovery from the loss of a loved one and coming to terms with the grief is usually most effective if we can learn to manage the grief finding a way forward to build a new life, with new purpose, where you can feel needed once again and but holding onto those precious memories of our loved ones.

I've noticed many others have suggested good, possible ways of moving forward, a new interest, putting your wonderful talents and qualities to a good and valuable use and to help you feel valued again so you can hopefully begin to feel as though you are providing a worthwhile service to someone or something in the case of a pet or animal charity.

There are so many deserving causes which I'm sure would love to have someone such as yourself volunteering.

When I was at an all time low, my goal eventually was to do some worthwhile voluntary work, get a meaningful job and to do a course to learn something new as well as several other things which would help such as exercise, a healthy diet and sunlight etc.  None of these things happen overnight and to me it was small, but significant steps towards an eventual goal.

It's not easy of course, I won't pretend it is, but it is possible, but you also need to lean on those who care and engage with outside help too if it is available, i.e. Professionals and charities, sorry to run on, not trying to preach, just thinking of anything which might just help, best wishes, xx",1
"I am so sorry for your loss. I lost my mother April 15 of 2009. It sent me into a tailspin after the reality set in. I was manic for over a year from that.

I too suffer from bipolar II and anxiety. Instead of changing up your medicines maybe you could just add a temporary medication to help you through this time,1

"It's ok to grieve and to go through a grieving stage. It doesn't mean you won't get out of it. Don't be automatically afraid of that.

I would say get a dog from a rescue place. My husband got one for me about five years ago after suffering from a life threatening sickness. When made it through that.

"I can relate on many levels. I have severe anxiety and became addicted to clonazepam due to a doctor prescribing more and more. I'm now working on a taper off of it. I have also had awful digestive/GI issues. A few months ago, I started on a probiotic system called Plexus which works to improve gut health. I have seen improvements with my GI issues. They also have another supplement which has been shown to help with anxiety. I'm going to try that when I have more money. I get how frustrating all of this is.",1
"Hey there. I've had uncontrollable diarrhea for over 9 years now. They keep saying it's just IBS, but ended up taking out my gallbladder due to it being unable to contract because it was full of stones (causing pain under the lower right ribs). But also, this is where your liver is. Have you been checked for elevated liver enzymes? I wasn't until recently, and I was diagnosed w fatty liver disease(also called non-alcoholic liver disease). 

Now, when I say diarrhea for 9 years, I'm not exaggerating at all. It started when i was 21, I'm now almost 31. It was also painful bloating, swelling of my abdomen to the point of looking 6-7 months pregnant, nausea, loss of appetite, and so on. Apparently, my stomach was moving the food through too fast and not allowing time to absorb nutrition from the food, leaving me w 6 vitamin deficiencies. My Dr prescribed an antispasmodic for me about 3 months ago. The difference is night and day!!! 3 gastroenterologist couldn't help me, after multiple endoscopies and colonoscopies. But one Dr who listened actually helped. I now barely bloat, can finish a meal without multiple bathroom breaks, and am starting to fit into my clothing again. 

I hope this information helps you.        Please note, I'm also on antidepressants, anti-anxiety medication, and anti psychotics. So it may be a group effort in getting your tummy on track.",1
I have some of the same issues. When I get to anxious I get really sick. The stress eats my inside. I have Gerd now which is acid reflex due to my anxiety. I also experience constipation a lot. I know it's very hard and people don't understand why or how we go through what we have. But you are not alone. You should seek out a Gastrointestinal doctor to prescribe you anti acids. They have helped for me a lot.i also take once in awhile amitza which helps constipation. I hope that helps. Good luck!,1
"I've had digestive issues due to anxiety since I was a kid.  I was involved in music and theatre and would either throw up or have uncontrollable diarrhea before I performed.  It got even worse after I had my gallbladder out.  If I had errands to run and was going to eat out, eating had to be last because I would have to go straight home.  They used to call IBS having a ""nervous stomach"".  So yes, anxiety can manifest itself through your digestive system.",1
It do cause digestive problems. When I get depressed and anxious I loose appetite. I have lost 23 kg in two to three months. My meds work just for few days then no effect. I also immagine getting worse disease . Yesterday was hell.,1
"Medications always have side effects for my 34 year old son, he is either constipated or running to the bathroom, he has developed thyroid issues from a drug he is no longer on.  He also has bad acid reflux and is on prescription Nexium.  Depression can make you feel bad or imagine things and then when you really are sick it makes you more depressed, this is from observing him for years.  My middle son also suffers from depression, the you 34 year old is bipolar.  When my middle son calls me and tells me things that I think are unworthy of him worrying about when he is depressed I tell him to put those worries on the shelf, they aren't worth worrying about.  It has taken him a long time to learn to put things on the shelf but he is doing it now and much better for it.  God speed to you!",1
Have you tried a medication called buspar- it is a nonaddictive option for the anxiety and that is the primary use for it.  I too have a lot of GI symptoms that on occasion make me sure something serious is happening but I am a medical professional so I keep trying to talk myself down- recently had a CT scan of the abdomen which is the gold standard for diagnosis of serious problems so I know it is just the anxiety.  I started the buspar a few months ago- worked up to 1.5 tablets twice a day but blurred vision made me contact my MD who changed it to 2 tablets at bedtime- good relief of the blurred vision but has left me a little more anxious due to the decreased dose so I will contact him again.   Like all meds hard to find the perfect dose at the get go but we keep trying.  Give the elavil a try it works for many GI symptoms.  Bipolar 1 x 40 years.,1
Im finding these posts really annoying!! I am Bipolar with depression and anxiety. I work my ass off to be the best I can be!! Rather that than spout how im up then down and get scared bla bla bla!!! I am Bipolar and proud that every day i do my very best to be amazing!!! Rant over.........,1
"Forgive me as I'm not aware of this 'schoeffective' disorder and couldn't find anything online so I'll just consider the anxiety as that is something I have more experience of.  As a mother of a teenage son with acute anxiety it can be so so hard.  As a parent we want to fix things, make everything ok and if we can't we can feel so helpless.

It's such an awful feeling to see your son suffer so much.  Acute anxiety can be so crippling, many people just don't realise, some even completely don't understand or wrongly assume.

We just want to make everything ok and when we can't we can feel a failure at times, when sometimes there just isn't anything we can do to make things ok.

With my son one of the main things he needed and relied upon was my strength, resilience, understanding and knowing I was always there for him, through thick and thin.  If I was to falter or push him into something he wasn't happy with then I know he couldn't have coped.  I believe they need loved ones to understand and be there for them.  It is hard enough to deal with the problems it makes everything so much worse when they believe people don't understand.

One of most frustrating things I've found about mental illness is the slow rate of recovery and being able to move forward.  It can take so long to build up the confidence needed to be able to do things.  When we crave the day when our children and young people can essentially be able to live a 'normal' life, it can be heartbreaking to see them struggling with a half life, battling with their demons on a daily basis.

When we see others, their peers living happy, fruitful and care free lives, it is so hard to know  what our young people are going through especially when we see their youth disappearing, not being able to fulfill their potential, not being happy.

Sometimes it's just too painful to really contemplate and it's better for our own sanity to just focus on the here and now and try to put our energies into the daily challenges.

Because progress can seem so painfully slow, e.g. getting a job, learning to drive, it's important to try to focus on smaller steps, smaller goals, by gentle encouragement and with kind praise and empathic reinforcement.  It has to be more their pace than ours as frustrating as it often is.

Quite often unfortunately, the pressure this brings on us has adverse effects and can lead to mental health problems for the parent/s who bare the lions share of the stress.  We aren't always strong enough which makes things extra hard.

Do you have any other professional support for you or your son?

It can feel so isolating when you see others effectively leading normal lives.

Things can get better, it's finding that way forward to 'beat' the conditions so they can control it rather than it controlling them, this can come with maturity and using each productive experience as evidence that they have overcome their anxiety on a particular day, or in a specific activity.

I'm sure you are doing a wonderful job and together as a team things will get better, but unfortunately it can take a lot of time, care and patience, best wishes x",1
"Marilyn Corrado ah yes, I can see the symptoms now, apologies for that.  I guess too you are in the US and I'm in the UK, so unfortunately services and provision are different there.

It sounds to me you are a brilliantly supportive and insightful mum.  I'm sure your son knows how lucky he is to have your continued support.  I know with mine he relies so heavily on me, which as you describe can feel as though you are doing everything in your power for him, but on the flip side it can feel such a weight, a pressure to make everything ok.  

It can seem as though you have to fight so hard for everything.  To get him into the best school for his needs didn't sound easy, but you did it and it probably good for him in many ways, but clearly he is struggling with the whole idea of being around like minded people.

That is one of the most difficult areas.  I really struggled with the whole issue of how to 'sell' the idea of having a mental illness to my son.  His problems started at the age of ten and I didn't want to label him, I didn't want him to be defined by it to think that this was how it was always going to be.  Like you, I wanted it to be talked about, no secrets or white lies as such, but I also wanted to give him hope that it wouldn't be like this forever even though of course I had no proof of that.  It's all so difficult and sometimes as parents we have to make these constant difficult decisions.  We have no handbook, how do we know what to do and say for the best? All we can do is try our best.

For him to not want to engage or socialise with the others does sound understandable.  He wants to feel normal, he wants to be a normal teenager.  In a way, I didn't really want to take him to workshops or courses for mental illness as it seemed to me that I would be confirming that this was to be his life.  It is a really hard thing to know what's for the best sometimes. But sometimes it is only those who suffer who truly understand.

It's got to be the right person I suppose for him to relate to and to feel an affinity with, it's not easy.

Yes, peer support and meeting others in similar situations can really help sometimes, are there any charities which have meetings? Although of course these might not be able to access if your son feels particularly anxious.

Does he engage with understanding people through social media would you know? This seems to be the most common means nowadays.

It must be difficult for you when you have other children as well.  Do you have avenues to be able to do things for you and people to support you?

Unfortunately, as frustrating it is, we can't just fix them.  My son who is also 17 has had very bad, long periods of suffering anxiety, but he is slowly moving forwards has recently secured a job and is starting to build a better life.  He is far from cured of course and lives quite an insular life, but there is hope and I'm sure you will get there, but depression as a result of acute anxiety is a real possibility and a challenge to ideally avoid, or if not treat.  Xx",1
"Thank you. His school has his psych and therapist which he sees 2X a week and then when needed. I go 1X a week or more if needed. I want to just fix him. I am his best friend and that breaks my heart. We do everything together which in turn can be trying on my patience. I then have to take some time alone and regroup. I have other boys so they all need something. The process is so very slow for recovery but he has improved beyond words over the past year so I have to focus on that. I just see that he gettting depressed since hes almost 17 and just not able to do what the others are doing. You wrote a beautiful response and I appreciate that. I wish there were group for parents like AA meetings so we can meet others. Seems many parents are reserved about their children with illnesses. We are open about it as I feel this is nothing to be ashamed of.  I fought for years to finally get him into the school he is in and its been the best thing for him. The problem with the school is that he wont let himself connect with any of the kids there as he says they are all ""weird"" but they are all like my son, some worse some not but he cant accept the he has a disability and keeps fighting it. I am hoping once he accepts it and just knows that the anxiety is his norm for now he may enjoy life a little more.",1

"I have very similar symptoms to yours and am also not sure if I am bipolar 2, my son was diagnosed but a psychiatrist told me I was a 'borderline' case. I am just utterly confused because the lows are so bad I just want die and then it gets better again till the next time. I am not on any meds at the moment, have been on so many different meds over the years and can't really say they made much difference.",1
I too am diagnosed with BP2. I am currently taking medication it's constantly an on and off cycle for me I've also noticed if I track my nutrients such as B vitamins folate and magnesium specifically in my diet I can maintain a more stable mood. It's hard because for 10 years I've tried to figure out patterns.  nowadays I know if I wake up with a bunch of energy and I start organizing or cleaning or trying to do everything at once I know I'm in a manic moment. It's an every day struggle but for me tracking my moods and what nutrients I am in taking have really helped. I use cronometer for nutrient tracking n I journal for mood patterns. Information and structured routine is key for me. Also it's very difficult to meditate but I try to because that also puts me in a much better mood afterwards,1
"Bp2 can have a depressed/manic ratio of 40:1 which means youll experience chronic depression with bouts of hypomania. So it sounds like that may be what youre experiencing. Remember manic isnt always happy and feeling great, it can also be just irrational and irratable behavior, really anything where you have pent up energy that doesnt go away. Periods of pent up energy that manifests in negative emotions and actions are probably a mixed state, which is when you have to be very mindful and aware as they can be the most dangerous part of living with bipolar. I would journal as much as you can, details about how you feel, when you feel that way, things you do, how you act, triggers that send you into depressed states or irritable or manic etc. this can really help a psychiatrist see a pattern that makes it easier to diagnose whatever is going on.",1
"It took a year of my psych working with me for them to finally say bp2. Even with my history, past hospitalization, etc. She started medicating and witnessed me in one mixed state and then headed into one hypomanic episode before finally shifting from major depressive disorder, anxiety and PTSD, to the bipolar. It definitely could be bipolar from what you're describing. Just please be prepared for them to be cautious in making the diagnosis. It takes time. I'm glad you're taking steps, and wish you well.",1
"that sounds like a mixed state, my friend. common with bp2. listen to your dr., and to your own sense of well-being. Ask questions, be informed. And don't be afraid to ask for support when you need it.",1

I cant wait to see their faces, when I do sleep, its straight into intense dreaming (nightmares) then awake, dreaming, awake, so I get no rest. I sit up, ill roll onto one side and prop myself up, waking an hour later to find my head welded to my shoulder. Takes a few screaming minutes. I have a totally fkd spine, c1,c2 fused, then bulging discs in 9 spots, if you looked down on my spine from above, its a corkscrew, had a couple of operations, ok for a while..

What med combo are you on now ? I always keep Clonazpam on me for anxiety.  Really helps.,1
"Have had so many meds I've lost count, each one has their own side effects. Over the the las ten years after a psychotic episode and being diagnosed Bipolar. Anti depressants make me high as a kite but it only took psychiatrist 9 years to come to that conclusion. Now I'm now on meds that keep me on the low side of steady, they keep me out of hospital but I am so depressed/anxiety that I hate waking up in the morning frightened of what mood I'll be in and how I'm going to cope most ways. Also have lost all friends as i haven't been fit to work for 30 years, I can understand they need to move on. But why cant they give me the odd phone call. Im a decent person and know i could never do that to them. Also being in and out of hospital you meet people think they're friends and we swap phone numbers but if you're kind hearted you soon realise they only want you for what you can give them . So I now realise they're not any good for me. I haven't been in hospital for 3 years and although I'm low i pray I don't want to go back again. Just wondered if anyone else has had a similar experience and can't see your way out of it xx",1
Yes Kevin we have to take it but I'm frightened what side effects they cause xx,1

I'm on Celexa for anxiety & depression...you're right Celexa causes a low sex drive!  Also on Lamotrigine for mood stabilizer.,1
I pretty sure u need a moid stabilizer w bipolar 2. None of those are mood stabilizers. Anxiety will be lower w mood stabilizer. Prob wont need ativan and is ur dr using gabapentin for anxiety may not need that if dr ordered u a mood stabilizer.,1
I was on gabapentin side effects were so bad... I'd shake so bad and be up 10+ times a night weeing... I'm on cymbalta now it's pretty good,1
"Every one has different reactions and body chemistry. I'm not sure what you are asking?  I take a mood stabilizer, antidepressant and an anti anxiety. I can't take benzodiazepines because of my addictive behavior. If what your taking works then stay with it, if you are concerned or feel you need something different ask your doctor. If you aren't seeing a psychiatrist it would help you to do so. Always give your meds time but also don't rely on others opinions.  Yours and your psychiatrist are what matters. Good luck!",1
"Zoloft, gabapentin, and xanax.  Ptsd and bipolar 2. Gabapentin made me forgetful so they put me on lamictal but if I hadn't been so Air headed I would have stayed on it since for me the combo was amazing for the anxiety and mood swings",1

I have type 2 with anxiety and am on xanax aswell I was on valluim but went down hill quick a doc that specialist in this told me that the valluim runs off the same receptor in the brain as the bipolar disorder medication hence going down hill but I find this works for me but each person is different hope this helps,1

"If that is the combination that works, ok, but injectible Abilify? You can take that orally. It is a horrible drug; I personally had bad reactions to it, at the forefront was akathisia. Lamotrigine didn't do anything for me. Clonazepam helped anxiety for awhile, but stopped working. So did Xanax. 

I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. The combination that ends up working for me is 450 mg Lithium Carbonate ER and 100 mg Sertraline. For some reason, yes my body needs an SSRI. 

Everyone's biochemistry is different. Unfortunately it takes ""playing the medication game"" a few times before finding the right combination of medication.  This really does seem like overkill, but I am not the doc either. Also it really depends on if you're functioning and happy. If you are, you're in the right place for now!",1

"I am down to Depakote and Effexor.  I have been on them a long time eighteen years and in the past two months was able to decrease them.  I was on Naproxen and allergy meds.  Meds get mixed up together and cause more side effects like depression.  I had an episode where my liver and kidney enzymes were higher than normal this year, and being 61 I am taking that to heart.  I have alpha 1 antitrypsin enzyme deficiency.  Anyone with liver disease or lung disease of ANY kind should be tested for this.  Taking the liver damaging medications if you have this condition can kill your liver.  I was taking tylenol twice a day 1,000 mg just to keep going with arthritis. This is hard on the kidney's.  I take it but as needed now.  I am in pain, and I am stiff, and some days I can't do much at all, but I do not want to die from liver failure or kidney failure.  These things can happen and they can be silent until the damage is great.  We can't just pop pills, we have to do other stuff to be emotionally healthy.  We have to stay engaged emotionally and have relationships with people that will help us reality test and ground us.  This is not to say that we should not make our own decisions.  WE must, but others around us can help us make good decisions.  We can't let our mental illness isolate us or think of ourselves as different because of psych diagnoses.  We gotta push through the emotions, get hurt, forgive, and learn all we can about what to be like and not be like from our encounters with others.  Also, our need for mental health drugs changes over time.  Sometimes we just have to settle down and not allow ourselves to get so upset.  We have to learn coping and calming strategies we did not learn before no matter what age we are.  Every day is a new day.  A lot of people advocate for exercise, meditation, the arts, etc.  I read the Bible and pray.  I seek God's help to live a Christian life to be a loving person.  It is easy to be selfish and grouchy, or self centered and depressed.  We don't have to give in to it.  For me, rest goes a long way.  Getting along with others can be tough.  If you are a parent you can't always do what you want because of other's needs.  You compromise a lot.  Life goes on, you live and learn.  Hopefully you will not need so many meds for a really long time.  If you need them, you need them.  Don't let them rob you of your life.  God Bless.",1

No wonder you are struggling...I'm so sorry    I suggest you see another psychiatrist     ‍♀️ I know that this is all unsolicited, but as a healthcare professional I could not help it...",1
"Suez GoturBack Fleshman I also use cannabis alot, personally it started when I was very alone and depressed as a way to help me cope but even now that Im much much more happier and healthier it still is a great mood stabilizer and also helps me manage my sleep schedule  a lot better, getting a solid 8 hours of sleep every night is one of the most important factors to remaining mentally healthy. I try to sleep without it but if my mind is racing I know it'll level me out and help me go to sleep and I dont have to worry about insomnia becoming a problem that compounds on my other symptoms. But with all of this being said everyone is different, everyone reacts to different medications differently, but cognitive behavior therapy is the one thing that I've experienced is a ""one size fits all"" type of treatment that works very well.",1
"If the combo has relieved you of symptoms, dont rock the boat. Klonopin stays around for some time in your system and can usually get away with taking less than perscribed, given you are taking a small dose but a through out the day  2mg which is about a normal. 
   Michele, I'm not a doctor but i have studied pharmacology to its basics. Giving adderall with klonopin? That mighy not be a good idea plus adding into gabapentin? Ouch. Doxepin as well? 
    See if your doctor can minimize this combo. Over time your brain and body are not going to like being up and down like that. Adderall is certainly something you may do with out as it causes anxiety  and can agitate insomnia, panic attacks and a schizoaffective disorder.",1
"Ebbie Casey My daughter get's so triggered when she goes out.  Her thinking about others get's so mixed up.  She imagines people are looking at her, talking about her, etc.  She imagines that people are other people or that she sees people from her past.  The stress of going out alone really triggers her.  She can't be on more meds.  Does anyone have a strategy for getting more comfortable with going out on your own to diminish these reactions?",1
"An take some rispiridone and it knocks that ""everyone is watching me edge"" off. I'm schizo affective, adhd, bipolar, I've had 3 serious nervous Break downs. I take adderal. No it's probably not the best idea ( elvis) but as doctor says, and I agree. "" it helps my patient, focus and finish projects or chores. It helps him live a somewhat normAl life, with out this medicine, my life becomes a mess, the house turns into a maze of unfinished cleaning and projects. My brain thinks to fast and I sometimes struggle to keep up with myself. The adderal lifts me up a bit, Yes, not that much. It then helps me to slow down and think things out to properly finish everything I start, and i don't fidget and squirm.
Ur right probably not the best combo for everyone. But I simply take rispiridone to knock off that nasty edge.",1
"I was guinea pigged with vistaril and it had no reaction with me, Prob ably because it's original intended use is for blood pressure. I got so tired of being put on meds that had other intended uses and treating anxiety was just a possible side effect",1

"The ability to sleep regularly, having a good  appetite but not overeating, being able to take care of ourselves and not take unnecessary risks, having a manageable anxiety level, having the ability to think and be organized, being motivated to get out of bed in the morning, not being too irritable, being able to listen to people without interrupting, being able to express ourselves well, being able to work towards some satisfaction in life, being able to have some self worth, some peace of mind, and good solid relationships are all things we want to have in our lives. If our moods or our mixed up thinking is interfering with these things, then we need the meds.",1
Thanks    it's not always easy but I have to push through can't let my kids see me struggling. on my bad days I sometimes have to go in bathroom  and splash water to cover the fact I was crying. But my kids (17 & 10) keep me going. Along with my therapy cat.,1
I use seroquel for bipolar one and anxiety it's s great feud but careful with ur weight  ,1
"As far as me (since it is completely different for everyone) I have been on 900 mgs of seroquel when I was really bad in highschool for 6 months and functioned great. I mean it put me out immediately so I only took it at night, but the next day I was as normal as possible. It made me gain weight quickly. Currently I am only on 75 of seroquel and only take more if it's an emergency and I just need to sleep through it. 

Cymbalta I was on it for around 7 years, until it became useless to me after brain chemistry changes. It helped keep me stable and was good for my depression. I assume it helped with my overall anxiety and OCD... not sure though.",1
"Lots of ugly on Seroquel lol. It is highly effective at treating anxiety/psych issues IF you don't mind eating the house down. Makes you starving!!!!! And lots of people gain serious weight. Myself, 60#",1
"No real issues with low dose Seroquel yet, just make sure you have 8+ hours to sleep after taking it, otherwise you might be a zombie the next day.

Cymbalta - believe your doc when they say do NOT stop taking it without consulting the doc; the withdrawal symptoms range from annoying to potentially life-threatening.",1
"Don't know about cymbalta but seroquel has changed my life I love it, taken my psychosis symptoms to very manageable, hardly any paranoia, sleep amazing and anger problems sorted right out, it's not ideal during day cos it does knock you out so need to slightly cut dose but worth it for the benefits, also I did gain nearly 3 stone but have managed to lose it and maintain the loss",1
Put on like 20kgs with seroquel in like 6 weeks so came of that. Cymbals was great to start with but anxiety levels were high and it stopped working after about 6mths,1
"Thinking of reducing my dose actually, has certainly curbed my anxiety",1
"Seroquel knocked me out. My maintenance guy came by to fix the sink, I tried to get up but couldn't move. My body was asleep but I could hear him talking. Weight gain as well. I've been on cymbalta for 3yrs and helps with my depression. I'm back on Ativan for anxiety though. I am feeling much better now.",1
"Withdraws from cymbaltaba were horrid. I had to go into the hospital for 2weeks until physical symptoms were relieved a bit but it took months before mental symptoms started to clear. 
  I would much rather have withdrawn from an opiate",1
Seroquel keeps me very stable however I was in too deep of sleeps and was afraid I wouldnt wake up so I just had my dose lowered,1
"Cymbalta is the o ly anti depressant that worked for me ,,, it didn't help with anxiety they tried me on 120mg and it made me sick and it didn't help with pain ,,, medications react differently for different people though I took myself off the cymbalta and I was taking 5mg of Abilify they were working but my bf said pills poison you blah blah so all I take now is Valium and if I take trazadone sometimes it knocks me out for a whole day and I can't have that I think it's similar to
Serequel I was 50mg 1-3 as needed though",1
"Been on cymbalta for years and it helps with my anxiety. Without it my head would be spinning. The bad, (at least for me) when it gets close to the time of my dose I experience anxiety- chest tightening and all so just make sure you don't miss doses.",1
"I have bipolar 1 and I was put on 600 mg of lithium and 3 mg of risperidone. I recently got that decreased to 1 mg though. I haven't been manic is over a year and I feel mostly good! My dad passed away from lung cancer last August and I'm struggling to find a job, so I'm depressed and anxious about that but that's understandable.",1
I take Lamictal  and when they took me off Tegretol they doubled the Lamictal dose and tolld it would hold me- did not happen- had a horrible long mania so they ended up putting me back on Tegretol and keeping the Lamictal as well- for me Lamictal just was not enough.  If you are having mania then you need more of a mood stabilizer plus a new doctor if she/he will not listen to you.  No doc should be threatened when we do research into our condition- we are the ones living with it not them.  I have been diagnosed bipolar 1 for 40 years or so.,1
"They use drugs like Limictil and Tegratol, which are anti seizure meds, but for mood stabilizer. They slow down the brain enough it stabilizes mood, so it doesn't matter if you have one or two. I'm on Tegratol, and it has saved my life. Nothing else has ever worked so well. If you're doing well I wouldn't worry about it.",1
im bi polar ocd add autism anxiety over 9000,1
"If it's working x don't worry. They only say that because it seems to help more with the depression side of things which bipolar 2 peeps seem to suffer more from. I am BP2 and just tried it, last resort getting desperate and I had a life threatening reaction to it. So count yourself lucky, you've found something that works. I have been battling rapid cycling and major depression looking for the right meds for 2 years now but I'm overly sensitive to everything, the only thing saving me at the moment is Valium and lots of it. Trust me if it works don't worry what it's meant for... which is actually epilepsy by the way   ",1
Lamictal made me barf. It's not worth it. Then they tried many others..prozac in am Zyprexa in pm. I'm not happy to report that the side effects. Lamictal made me so sick in 2 days. All the others I've taken over 20 years were never worth. I  just treat my anxiety with xanax ( small dosage) and hydroxizine  ( visteral) which helps with anxiety.,1
"I have bipolar 2. I'm also on lamictal. I take it with my lithium. I would think that as long as the medication is working and it's treating the bipolar, I would try not to stress too much about if it's for BP one or two.",1
Lamictol is a great mood stabilizers. Why he going off Cymbalta? He must be very careful as withdrawal from it is frightening,1
"I have always taken my Lamictal in one dose. Asked my dr if I could. She looked up the half life & told me I could. Its more convenient & I don't miss doses. Some drs tell me it needs to be in 2 doses. Yet I've never had any of them look up the half life. I continued to take it in one dose, but I tell the dr whatever they want to hear. 
Lamictal is a mood stabilizer. Abilify is an anti-psychotic medication. Lexapro, zoloft, etc are anti-depressant drugs. Be careful not to compare these drugs to one another. It would be like comparing apples to oranges.
Lastly......Cheryl Berndt. You are confused. Genetic disorders like bipolar, depression, GAD, ADHD, ARE treatable with medications. Things like PTSD, narcissistic personality disorder,  Stockholm syndrome, etc are also mental illnesses. Yet these are some types of mental illnesses that medication does little for. They are not a chemical imbalance.",1
Latuda works wonders for me.. and xanax for anxiety,1
The gene for my anxiety is SLC6A4. According to bipolar writer and psychiatrist K R Jamison the identification of a gene for bipolar is definitive.,1
"If his condition is genetically inherited he is actually his REAL SELF in which case no intake of any form of medication will alleviate any of the symptoms associated with the illness. Moreover, uninhabited illnesses exacerbate the inherited ones which are marginally aided by medications . My inherited illnesses are Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Bipolar  Disorder exacerbated by acquired Borderline Personality Disorder,   rapid cycling moods, PTSD and OCD. The powerful medications I am on set me off into a middle-of-the-road dimension as I remain marginally 'well'",1

"Been on it almost 4 months. Have had a slow steady increase of dozage over quite a period of time. Don't know yet if it will work for me over a longer period of time. Sideeffects? Hmm, for the last 3-4 weeks I've had very bad anxiety - a type I've never experienced before. It's been so bad that it's led me to develop pattern of ocd-like thinking and actions. This anxiety makes me exhausted. Also more irritated (borderline aggressive). Mentioned this ""new"" to my caregiver, since  I myself think this anxiety level and mood may be sideeffects of lamictal. However, psychiatrist does not think so. Don't know if others have experienced similar...(by the way; am Swedish and over here the drug often is called lamotrigin).",1
"only thing that keeps me going is earning a bit more money and often main reason I don't commit suicide is because I don't want my siblings to inherit my share of the family fortune how sad is that?

"I totally agree with the first comment. I too have a great life, a truly amazing wife, a brilliant (although admittedly sometimes stressful) job, great friends, about to move to a lovely new house and the future is looking great.

"Depression is not situational dependent - depression is a mental illness that can hit anyone, at any age, at any time.

"I haven't worked since I was diagnosed 5 years ago.  I did start volunteering at a local aquarium one day a week.  It was a stretch physically, but mentally and emotionally too.  Being around crowds, interacting with strangers, no down-time.  Some days I had to retreat to the stairwell just to clear my head.  It got easier each time.  Just factor in the physical stress of doing something new and know that will effect you emotionally as well.",1

It makes you feel out of control when not in it your mad sad you want to cry at everything you can't sleep you fell off it awful I have been in it 15 years now my insurance says they no longer pay for it I don't know what I'm going to do I'm so scared I will get so sick plus I'm a ex drug addict I'm scared I'll use to ease my pain so what ever you do try and keep your head up,1
It was horrible for me... I went off slowly and according to the doctors orders still withdrawals sucked....,1
"Horrible, was zombie 24/7, sleeping 17 hrs a night",1
"I was on a low dose of seroquel to help me sleep and help my moods. It did the trick except for 1 side effect. I had the most terrifying nightmares in my life. I would wake up feeling so anxious. It wasn't worth the stress. Cut cold turkey with no symptoms  but again it was a low dose. I tried trazadone after that and had hangover symptoms (nausea,  vomiting,  migraines). Now I'm on invega. I don't snap as much or as easily as I used to but still don't sleep well.",1
"I quit cold turkey, not gonna sugar coat it, shit was the same as withdrawing from meth (3years sober) for me. Couldn't eat, stomach hurt all the time, couldn't sleep, shaky, paranoid, the list goes on.",1
I had bad anxiety.  I dint sleep for 3 days.  Not even a nap.,1
I was prescribed seroquel with lamictal and had a horrible allergic reaction. Extremely high fever and broke out in a rash..... After reading these comments I'm thankful I had that reaction.....,1
"I did seroquel with Lamictal, it gave me severe reactions. I've  been taking lamictal for years but the combination was horrible. I now do lamictal with effexor, it seems to work for me",1
"That's the only medication combo that has given me a reaction. My doctor just prescribed me Zoloft.... A few months ago I had just came off of lithium. She literally said to me ""oh Zoloft is going to help with your anxiety but if you're bipolar your symptoms might get worse"" & my anxiety was too bad to stay and try to find another medication. I just went with it. So I guess we are playing Russian roulette with medication now   ",1
It was horrid. I hate it and will NEVER use it again.,1
"horrible. Even when I tapered off I had itching all over my body and had to take benedryl for like a month and a half. This can happen because seroquel has antihistimine in it, and your body is used to having a certain amount running through it and when it dwindles you can itch terribly.",1
"oh god. ive only been on it for a few months, im scared to read these comments!",1
"I've been on these meds (high dose) for 4 and a half years. I'm trying to reduce it down for the 3rd time, each time is horrid. I know the good and bad of these meds and have had most of the bad side effects and bad withdrawl symtoms. And I'm still scared to read this. Medications that work wonderfully for some people don't always work for others, but if you don't try them out you'll never know. Good luck and best wishes to anyone on serequel, from the UK.",1
I'm scared too I get a reaction like a rash light headed and dizzy so now I break it in half I just don't have much energy waiting to see the doctor,1
It's horrible,1
I was tapering off in January and it was a fairly horrible experience- lots of body aches and pains and just felt like I had the flu all the time plus totally emotionally all over the place- eventually decided I was tapering too fast (50 mg a week) and when I slowed down it got a bit better.  I got to 200 mg and stopped and then later got a horrible mania so had to go back to 250 but refused to go back any higher.,1
When i was tapering from it i got super restless..like unable to sit down. I cried a lot..i was very emotional. It wasnt fun.,1
"Going through tapering now, for 3rd time. Feeling like you descibed Beth O'Neill . I'm glad I read what you said, as it's making me feel less worried about it not being normal. I couldn't remember what the tapering was like before as it was aweful, but I was really unwell mentally too at the time. Thank you.",1
I'm prescribed 2mg xanax 3 times daily. Helps my anxiety and I'm able to sleep. I'm just really depressed due to the loss of my lil bro on the 4th of July. He was only 34 and had wife and 2 kids. Service this Saturday and I'm an emotional wreck.,1
My dr had me try lexapro after I refused seroquel. Then cymbalta and finally Wellbutrin. The last one was awful for me. Felt horrible for 7-10 days. Dizzy and felt like the room was spinning. I just stopped taking it. I am done trying antidepressants!,1
"I can't really function unless I have it. The times that I can't have it, I get  shaky and nauseous and cannot sleep at all. It's not fun at all, but Seroquel makes me feel like a normal person.",1
"They moved me because my high levels of absence (not all for anxiety but other, linked, reasons such as my medication to help me sleep caused me to get migraines etc.) made me unreliable and they moved me to a department which could absorb my absence levels better.",1
"I was hoping to stay anonymous but wanted to respond to this - my managers were fully aware that the area I've been moved to exacerbated my anxiety, yet moved me there anyway. They aren't interested in any kind of compromise.",1

"Research n see if Maybe in the next few stops on your route n see if u can get a bed at one of the womens shelters.

Stand strong and remember even when its uncomfortable, anything is better than being basically held prisoner :( you can do bad all by yourself.",1
The struggle is real.,1
"Yes, all true, but if I don't face all of my fears head on I become a prisoner in my own home. It has taken hard work and I am not quite where I want to be, but I am living a better life then I did even a year ago. Never give up! <3",1

"That's an SSRI isn't it? You might have high levels of serotonin (maybe dopamine as well?) already. Some people with certain gene mutations react badly to SSRI for that reason. If its really bad, low doses of no flush niacin can calm the anxiety from it temporarily. Def tell the doc!",1
"O.K so I have major depressive disorder was on Cymbalta for a few years when I recently realized I was sleeping til 4-5 p.m and really no interest in anything. Checked into Heritage Eastside behavioral hospital so I could see my psyc doc ( most psychiatrists don't take Medicare as an outpatient.) He switched me to Effexor which seemed to work better but it is a serotonin norephrine reuptake inhibitor. From what I have researched it's the norephrine that provides a boost in energy. It already seems to have leveled off in effectiveness at 75 mg. I need more energy still. Since I'm dealing with a p.c. physician now any thoughts on suggestions I will bring up to her i.e upping dosage etc? Everyone of you out there experiencing these problems stay strong, this coming from a former N.G.C cadet!",1
"So, I have Bipolar 1, and a few other diagnoses. Like many people, depression occurs more often than mania. There is new research (just Google stimulant use with depression or bipolar) that shows stimulant medications may help. Stimulants do not fix the depression but do provide some energy that helps kick start behaviors that help deal with depression. I can only take it for 2-3 days because of the mania that can occur. However, it is not unheard of to use stimulants this way. Also, a doctor is always the best place to start. I wish any medications worked for me. It takes me lots hard work to deal with my past, to change my behavior, and willingness to sit through the misery. If someone can get help through medication, please accept the help. Don't sit in misery you don't deserve.",1
Jeanette I have to disagree with you I am on a medication called Vyvanse it is similar to Adderall but it slowly goes up levels off and Peaks down it helps me clarify my thoughts because I have bipolar and also anxiety disorder as well as adult ADD it does give me a little bit more energy to be able to proceed with my day so that is not 100% true,1

I am afraid one day, I'm gonna go to far, and I actually pray for him to take me home. ..I would say try, getting angry (yep that's right) ,get mad at the evil spirit that is doing this to you thru you, when you feel it coming, let it out of your mouth your feelings and speak to that bad thing and tell it how pissed off you are and how you are a beautiful child of GOD and your body belongs to him and say this ""I rebuke you, you weak and defeated enemy, you have no power here, the holy blood of Jesus Christ gives me AUTHORITY to cast you unholy spirit into the void ""..I say speak because,everything in this world was created with a word, and the power of life and death there dwell, the tongue is the most powerful thing, ...God loves you, and GOD BLESS you",1

They are poison to us, they will light the fire, OR they will end up making you worse. ..separate and disassociate from all negative and miserable people, our sickness or what ever you want (Satan) gets stronger when you are surrounded by them, the difference between us and them is they are full of hatred and jealousy and they need to make us lower than them so they can feel powerful, justified, its like they want to be the victim. ..get away from them, soon and. ..talk to GOD, pray, AND READ YOUR BIBLE! ??EVERYDAY",1
"I usually get a manic episode in the end of march beginning of April and then again in August. And yes my sex drive goes in over drive. I won't lie at first I kind of enjoy the mania after depression,  the first day or so at least maybe. But as others have said, it's important to get back on a stabilizer to get it back under control.  A few days without sleep,  flu like symptoms, we start forgetting what we are doing, and not evening knowing what is happening around us. I am actually schizoaffective disorder bipolar type as well as ptsd with anxiety. I know sometimes i feel I can go without meds, or I just hate the side effects.  My fiance, as much as I love him, can be so unsupportive when it comes to my mental health. But this is about you and your well being. You come first.",1
"I'm bipolar type 2 with PTSD and anxiety. I also am seasonally affected, it's common. I take a small dose of antidepressant from Oct-Feb annually because the depression is so bad in those seasons. And some years, I need a small additional mood stabilizer or antipsychotic in spring or summer for the hypomania. Sleeplessness, racing thoughts, anger, overspending, being a total busy bee...but the med changes keep the more severe reactions like suicidal thoughts at bay. I'm sorry about your partner. That's truly not healthy and not good for your well being. You need love and support.",1
Nope getting mania in the summer is common- increased sex drive is also common and being angry at the drop of a hat is also common- you have just given textbook symptoms of mania in bipolar disease.  Though it will be hard to do you need to get back on your meds- you need at least a mood stabilizer to get the mania under control.  Stopping and starting the meds does nothing to make the disease better and will give you more heartbreak over your life.  Yes the meds are awful and have awful side effects- you need to work with your doctor to  find the best ones for you- just stopping without discussing the side effect that is driving you crazy does you no good and does not let the doctor help you figure out how to deal with it.  An example- I am newly on buspar for anxiety- it was causing double vision every day for about 5 hours- I really hated that- instead of stopping I talked with the doctor and he made the suggestion to stop the morning dose and just take a bigger dose at bedtime-tada no double vision in the daytime and I could care less if I have it while I am asleep.   I have had bipolar 1 for 45 plus years or so and diagnosed about  age 24 (I am 60).  Trust me the range of medication options now is so so much better than in the 80's- do yourself a favor and start seeing a therapist a couple of times  a month to deal with the emotional fallout of you life and being bipolar and get back on the meds- they are the key.  I wish you well in the journey we call life.,1
"I find it hard dealing with repressed childhood abuse and trauma. I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar - I have ptsd, anxiety and depression. 

You can pull through my darling, think about all the things you haven't yet achieved. Think about all the experiences you are yet to gain. Meditation and conscious breathing help me chill - as well as a spliff when I have money. Your bf is a c""#nt for saying that!!!!",1
"My ex tried, worked well but kept relapsing..helped with the anxiety and tremors",1
Zoloft is a good script your going to have anxiety  but the Zoloft will help with that ask your psych doctor cause it may cause depression,1
I would exhaust all medication options first. I had extra it didn't work and the memory loss is awful. I now can't drive long distance as I can't remember directions or follow them I get confused thanks to extra. Try every other option first.,1
"Sorry, my comment included a few errors. It only helped alleviate my symptoms for approximately one MONTH, not week. I would not recommend it. There is a newer similar therapy that is supposedly similar. It is TMCS which stands for trans magnetic cranial stimulation. I'm unsure regarding it's availability and whether or not insurance covers it",1
"I had 9 ect treatments several years ago. I was in a very deep depression for over 2 years that no other treatment or meds would help. It helped me a lot. If i ever had to i would go through it again. You definitely need good support going through it, as it is hard on your body and your memory, but it is well worth the work. The first treatment is a little scary as you don't know exactly what to expect.",1
"I had 12 ect in 2012 and it worked but the side effects and memory loss is ridiculous. I regret every treatment but my family directed the foctors to do it i had no choice. My short term loss and long term loss are both screwed its horrible i cant remember my kids growing up i cant remember birthdays and little things that make me,me. I wouldnt do it if i were you i would try all medications before ect.",1
"Hi. I had 12 ECT treatments, 6 years ago for severe depression that was resistant to all other treatment and medication. It was very beneficial for me although i now have huge chunks of my life that i cannot remember which is upsetting. I would rather have that than try and fight the depression everyday. If you have the support you will need, i would say have the ECT. All the best.",1
"I find this to be false. Type 1 diabetes, bipolar, ptsd, severe depression, anxiety problems.... they are all treated as something that was my fault. I didn't ask for any of it every day people tell me just to suck it up. I'm told at least once a week that I shouldn't have eaten so much candy as a kid, blah, blah, blah.... I was probably one of the smallest kids in my school, was always active and outside playing, running, riding my bike and yet here we are being blamed for some shit I had no control over. Fuck you world... FUCK YOU!!",1
Caitlin Summars I don't think I was being biased. I was being very understanding to both sides. In your first comment you definitely were being one sided. Considering you yourself struggle with mental illness I can't understand your lack of empathy. You stated in your first comment a diabetic illness can take a life unlike a chemical imbalance. That's all you said. No explanation & I completely disagreed with that & no one should prefer to be labeled crazy. I've had family members die of cancer & they've definitely had more sympathy through their struggle than a person with a mental affliction. Love & understanding to all. I will say no more.,1
"Cherie I do not underestimate mental illness at all. Both my son and I have ADHD...I also have anxiety and depression. Most days I am suicidal...though I would not actually take my life...I think about it constantly. I battle every day to get up..to interact with others...and I have struggled ALL of my life to hold down a job to support my family. 
I have also watched diabetes cause thoughts of suicide in my younger sister. She tried to take her own life through her disease. Its all AWFUL...it all hurts and its all a struggle. My point was, if we went three-five days without psychiatric meds there is no guarantee we would be dead...but if a diabetic went that long they most certainly would be. Stigmas attached to diabetes also cause feelings of guilt, isolation... Maybe because your experience is one sided its a bit biased towards mental illness. I have and do deal with both daily.",1
"Depression and other mental conditions can cause suicide. The stigma associated with mental illness cause more suffering, guilt, isolation and sometimes drive people to take their own life. I agree one disease should not be compared to the other, & I feel for you and your son, but do not underestimate the pain of having a mental disorder.  In my experience the stigma is greater.",1
Im a diabetic and have depression and anxiety....didnt want either,1
"Yes, play solitaire. It takes your mind off you & is the best for me to relieve anxiety.",1
"Yes. I think about death all the time especially my family. After my mother expired, I develop major depression and anxiety. I feel as though if something bad happen to my family, it will take me off the edge. I'll be back at the beginning. Just don't want that to happen",1
I think the fear and anxiety you feel when thinking about death is it's not that your scared of dying but leaving your family and the ones you love most behind that's what I tell myself anyway and it kind of helps a little maybe try keeping yourself busy find a hobby or something and do that when you feel a anxiety attack coming it should help x,1
Overthinking is our worst enemy i apply to everything leading to anxiety leading to insanity.,1
"I used to have severe panic attacks about my mother dying, before I was put on meds I wrote down a list of things I wanted to imagine instead:
What would my life be like if I had the power to shapeshift?
What would I do if I met the Avengers and Loki?
What situation would cause me to meet these people?
Same as above but with a celebrity I liked.
If I was a villain what would I be after?
What if I had control of fire and ice?
Imagine owning a team of six sports dogs. What breeds and what sports would I like?",1
It's a catch 22. Sometimes you're so fetup you want to end it all. Then you are obsessed with the thought of dying. This can swirl for ever in my head.,1
I understand what you mean I go through stages that I dont want to be here anymore and be pain free sometimes I don't want to die I just don't want too exist sometimes I want to die then I have times where I think about dying and once youre dead that's it you're gone forever and my stomach turns and I freak out so much!! It's a horrible feeling but I just can't help when it happens and stop thinking about it x,1
"I know this doesn't solve anything, but try finding a book series or TV show that you can really get into. It helps both my husband and I to be distracted by something when we're feeling anxious/scared/depressed. You may even be able to train your brain to relax, just by having the show on in the background. Again, I know it's not a fix, but sometimes we need a temporary solution while we wait for the bigger fixes (like meds and counseling and the like) to start working their magic",1
"it could be a medicine or combination of meds that triggering the thoughts. i started taking Trintellix and now i'm getting anxiety attacks, plus other unpleasant side-effects. ... my last anxiety attack, i forced myself to mentally walk through a place that brings me happiness, a place with many happy memories attached to it. i had to force myself to remember those happy memories, but the attack subsided after about 15 minutes. i was still very agitated, though. and i didn't sleep well for a couple days. but even with all that, it was better than the anxiety attack.",1
"Well I had a medication that triggered night terrors. Make sure first that it's not link to some of your medications, otherwise I would have to get up turn on the lights take a bath do something to  keep myself from going down the rabbit hole. Yeah I guess I use distraction techniques to derail my brain",1
sounds like you afraid of death or dying. I was like that big time  but had to redirect my thoughts its hard keep my mind busy something u like to do I am on lexamil was tough at first but I have to learn to cope,1
"It's not that I'm thinking of killing myself when I have these thoughts, it's that i get scared thinking about how I'm going to die and what death is like.",1
"Me too. And not only recently. Most of my life. Suddenly I start thinking about death and I give myself a panic attack, which makes me feel like I'm dying right now. It's awful...",1
Dont be afraid. You will meet the king when you pass.,1
"I turn to gratitude....grateful for my job, parents, brother, house, friends, kids.....really comes into perspective when I see a homeless person with daily life struggles....brings me brief relief from depressive thoughts",1
"Death is our only transport to meet the Creator, no one is immune to it. Being thankful and having gratitude lessens the anxiety about it. You can be thankful even for the smallest things like commenting here...others are blind, some are fingerless, some don't have phones etc. In everything we need to be thankful. Appreciation goes a long way even if our family members sometimes think we are acting out but love covers a multitude of sins. I really love your comment.",1
Thoughts of death are a common theme with depression.every day the thought of my own demise crosses my mind.they say live your life like its your last day but in reality the thought of dying scares the shit out of most people,1
"Just don't think about it. It happens to me too when I think on it, and it used to be worse back after my first anxiety attack where I wouldn't even step foot outside. 
But now, I've realized that it's apart of life and there isn't anything anyone can do about it. So, I don't bother thinking about it. I think about how to make my time here worth it.",1
"Lol. The thing is, I'm not. That's how I cope with my anxiety. If something is causing me anxiety, I've trained myself to not even bother thinking about it. Because the moment I Do? Anxiety creeps back in. 

Everyone has different coping methods.",1
I have same problem I want to die but can't when upset it feels like nothing left,1
Withdrawals are a bitch. 1 to 2 weeks of misery. I just went off Prozac and Zyprexa but I did it at home cause I couldn't function. Psychiatrists always want to drug us. I am on mild xanax and non habit forming hydroxizine  ( visteral) andyes I have extremes highs and lows but I'd rather have that than the side effects of all that other shit. It took about 3 weeks to detox. Plus I detoxed from cigarettes too. Tough but doable,1
I had similar withdrawals after stopping Wellbutrin. Didn't dose down and had problems for about 7-10 days. Doubt that helps because all meds are different but I wish you well.,1
I feel like my life is being robbed by bi-polar. I scares me and I don't iknow how to stop it.,1
"True,, but it also gives you a chance to recreate yourself in a brand spanking new way. A way that gives you a chance to be the person you could never be with out living through it. It gives you the opportunity to map out your life as you want it to be. Had stuff, but we are all so worth the work and struggle to beat this. It is forever my friend, but I CHOSE how to live.",1
I had the mental capacity to become something extraordinary. Maybe a surgeon a fighter pilot the sky was the limit then depression came along and destroyed me.my intelligence went to waste.my life is going down the drain in a clockwise downward spiral.I fear n have no hope for the future my life is technically half over n I've achieved very little.I exsist I'm not living to my full potential. I may as well b an enatimate object,1
Anxiety yes i have.....hell it feels,1
Depression n anxiety go hand in hand make it hard to function efficiently,1
U can't stop the stigma it will always remain because people hate n fear what they don't understand.its been there since the dawn of time.,1
Still battling... doctors..therapists..psychiatrists..meds..never ending it seems.. and my 8 yr old picked up slight anxiety from me and I feel horrible..now he's in counseling too.. helping him now so he doesn't turn out like me   ,1
Don't give us a placebo give us a fucking cure.I've tried so many medications nothing relieve s the pressure in my head.,1
Watch your breathing- during a panic attack you will breathe more rapidly and shallowly. Taking deeper breaths more slowly can help.,1
I would try to wait to take the xanax until the morning or until a trigger is beginning. It's onset is usually 15-20minutes and is used in panic attacks more so as they have a shorter duration (4-6hrs) then many of the other benzos (12+hrs),1
Anxiety meds! May slso be ADHD,1
"Mine get bad sometimes music will pull me out, or being busy with a focused activity that I enjoy, like baking or coloring. I use the Calm app and do a meditation if they're racing and I'm anxious or trying to sleep. Sometimes, I have to get my meds bumped up. They just won't stop until I do. It has lasted weeks before. Good luck.",1
Find a physical activity. My mind runs away on me all the time it's hard but in the last year I've taken up running and I now run a lot. If my mind can run me to panic my legs can run my to calm or physical exhaustion.,1
Mindfulness will change your life.. Focusing back to the present moment does wonders. Mindfulness is a hard skill to learn so try not to get upset at yourself if you lose focus. Keep practicing and have it become a part of your lifestyle.,1
Look up mindfulness on the internet. You can even get apps for your phone. It helps you focus on the here and now and the anxiety drifts away. It has been a godsend.,1
I would stick  it through the appointment next week- see if he is willing to go back on some sort of mood stabilizer- you might have to set up an agreement about supervised meds (he leaves them so you can see that he is taking them).  Without the meds this is only going to get worse so then you have a right to protect yourself- a trial separation might jolt him a bit into making the changes he needs.  You mentioned sleep apnea- interrupted sleep is a huge issue for bipolar- does he have some sort of machine or oral device to stop the apnea????  I know the affair is hard- know it is probably the bipolar talking but not sure how much that helps.  I have been bipolar 1 for 45 years- just had an huge long deep mania- at some point I listed our house for sale!!!   Now that they decided I can indeed have the only mood stabilizer that works for me (tegretol) and I am back to a therapeutic level I realize how horrible I was to my husband and I apologize several times a day- I made very concrete plans to leave him during the three months and was in general a bitch to live with.  Now that the docs have quit doing experiments with me I love him so so much for being able to stand it all.  All I can say for me is the medications are key- the side effects are horrible and piss me off every time I look in a mirror and see how fat I am and every time I am thirsty but can have no liquids  (they took me off tegretol due to a low sodium level- no other mood stabilizer worked and for a year I just went crazy- now they have decided I can have the tegretol but have to limit fluids and eat/drink a ton of sodium).  Bipolar is a serious disease and just going without the meds for a prolonged period is really really hard.  It is not something you can think yourself out of.  Will be happy to chat with your husband if you think he would talk to me/and that it would help.,1
"This is a tough situation but not uncommon.  I was diagnosed with BP  II more than 25 years ago and still struggle with taking meds. Most, if not all, of the meds used have side effects and some are worse than the bipolar itself.  The only thing you can control in this situation is you, but you can continue to encourage him to take the meds.  There are many meds available and everyone responds differently to them.  He can tell his psych he wants to try something different because he can't tolerate the side effects.  I have also found that supplements, magnesium and vitamin D, help me tremendously.  You may want to suggest something like that as well.  Keep in mind that you can't force someone to do something and threatening typically doesn't help.  Focus on you and taking care of yourself and let the rest work itself out.",1
The struggle with meds is pretty common. On/off etc.   I don't make very good decisions when I'm manic. What he's saying/doing might be symptoms rather than reality. I'm not sure of course. I hope things get better  ,1
"I have BPD, Bipolar 2, PTSD, ADHD, depression, anxiety, and OCD...I've been on Effexor 187.5mg, Lamictal 400mg, Intuniv 4mg, for 3 years now (since I was 17). It's been the most helpful combination of meds they've ever tried and I've tried well over 100 meds since I was diagnosed at 10 years old.",1
"Often times these illnesses go hand in hand so it's not uncommon to have multiple diagnoses.  Since there are no tests, diagnoses are made based on behavior over a period of time.  I have BP II and have been on more meds than I can count over the years.  I also have thyroid problems, but it has nothing to do with the meds.  It seems to be more related to the BP itself.  If you're having problems with weight gain, tell your doctor to try a different med.  There are many available that was don't cause weight gain.  I've learned over the years that you have to be your own advocate.  Do your research.  Research the different meds available, nutrition, supplements etc. and don't hesitate to  make suggestions to your doctor.  If you can't tolerate certain side effects, speak up.  If your doctor doesn't listen to you, find a new doctor.",1
I take cymbalta right now 90mg and Abilify 5mg all the other antidepressants either didn't work or made me sick....im major deppression....general anxiety...bi polar and fibromyalgia so far thats what i have,1
It caused me to have panic attacks and all I wanted was some sleep!,1
"Wellbutrin XL is an amazing medication. I tell doctors that it helped me with my patience and toned down my anger issues. I'm also on lamictal and without it I'm short fused and irritable. So in combination they seem to work pretty decent. 

I hope you find the right combination for you!

Also started Latuda for 4 weeks and it was great. My mind didn't feel bogged down and heavy. It was like a refresher and cleaned the negativity from my brain.",1
"Hey Chad im in recovery myself im aware theres different addictions, i know about the struggles of faceing our demons that kept me using, i fight em errr day i have a good relationship wit my higher power ill support anyone in recovery n some in active addiction i talk wit em n try to encourage them to get help",1
"Addicts brains aren't the same as a non addict. I never said addiction wasn't real either. Simply that it is the fault of the addict and the addict only. 

Back to the brain... 
An addicts brain deteriorates over time. But only by choice. Hate to break it to you. If you don't touch the shit in the first place, you won't have to worry about killing your brain. My 44 year old mother is an addict and i hate her now because she chose meth over my sisters.  She acts like a 15 year old. By CHOICE because she put the pipe to her lips in the first place.",1
I HATE Effexor! It turned me into an angry and irritable b__tch,1
Yes and its horrible,1
"I was a in that place for a lot of years, 20+ to be honest but I've pressed the reset button in my head and hate has become peace and acceptance and most of all Iove who I am today.

Omg. I struggle with this daily. It so hard,1
It will take awhile for me. Been depressed and anxiety-filled for about 25 years. Now I'm trying to deal with the death of my 34 year old younger brother. Had a wife and 2 kids. So sad!!,1
"I can relate to you with the weight gain and meds I'm currently reducing mine I understand if no one else does that putting weight on effects your mental state aswel and diets do exist and so does exercise but until ppl realise that some meds make it so no matter what you do it doesn't work, I also understand about living is harder I have suffered something similar and for that I saw a councillor and worked through it it doesn't happen overnight but you can get through it with determination that it's not going to takeover your life mindfulness if you do it properly does work for trauma, I feel your pain and know how hard life can be but you can work through it and succeed in your life, your 19 and have been through hell but take control and you win not them I know you can do it just take one day at a time and you will be able to have a life it never goes away but you can deal with it the things you have been through do not define you as a person it's going to be hard and your going to have to deal with feelings that are overwhelming but believe me, I can talk about it without feeling anything now because I have taken control and so can you I hope this has helped take care and remember one day at a time xx",1
"the person who got killed may wish they were alive to tell the tale like you  they never got the option. it must be hard to live with all this but consider others who will not even share here for fear, Sometimes we have to acknowledge life is tough and move on. your chance is university to move on and put a line under the past. you can either let who did this to you ruin your life or make them aware you survived and can do more. you can and will achieve and do not use anything as a crutch. Hold that head up you can and you will do it the oprion is stay in this state which is no good and well you have tried it to see no one realy helps, so fight and stay strong and move on if you do not make it sorry no one does it for you.",1
I was given it once and I am well old now so do not judge everyone to need your way out. In deep depression  you may not be able to accept another to lean on. There is many ways and yes people survive.  Other have not.  Arguments like your instigating cause stress so you are causing grief here unnecessary through your misinterpretation.  The main teenager maybe brighter and more able. Now enough.,1
"if I have an infection in my body antibiotics will, in fact, cure me of that infection.  Resting will help me feel better faster, but that isn't what will heal me.  People DO help.  If it wasn't for my friends and family being there by my side and supporting me I wouldn't be able to make it through life.  Yes, I have to do the hard work myself but anything that helps me without hurting me is much needed in surviving a mental illness.  The things that don't help is just trying to ""hold my head up"" and ""stay strong and move on"".  If it was that simple nobody would have anxiety or PTSD or depression or any other mental illness.  I'm not trying to give you a hard time, but telling someone that is swiftly sinking into the pit of darkness that nobody can help them is fucking bullshit!  Nobody can do the work for me, but they can help me from falling too far.  And that's an important thing to remember.  Sometimes it really does take more than ""strategic planning"" and hoping for the best.",1
"excuse me, but in saying not to use anything as a crutch and that no one helps and if she fails oh well are you advising this depressed, traumatized, girl begging for help not to seek professional treatment and medication and to just live with herself in a suicidal state?  Medication and therapy are not crutches any more than my blood pressure medicine or allergy medicine are.  No more than my friend's insulin is.  By your reasoning it was a bad thing my brother went and got surgery and bars and pins put in his ankle when he broke it in 4 places.  He should have just lived with it in the state it was and if he was crippled for life oh well.  I'm sorry for what ever you went through in your life to make you devalue everyone else, but please let's not turn this support page into a place we basically tell people to go ahead and kill themselves.",1
"Hi sweetheart I'm sorry you are going through such trauma at a young age. I hope you have received rape counseling and  PTSD counseling and therapy. It sounds like you are suffering terribly. At your age I wouldn't want to gain weight either, any age really but because you are so young your body is still changing so you might not have such a bad problem. I don't know because the meds I'm on don't effect me like that.  I'm being treated for Bipolar, major depression and anxiety. I'm also a recovering alcoholic and prescription drug abuser.  I know it seems impossible to even think you will get better but you will if you really want to, but you have to do some of the work. There are antidepressants that actually suppress the appetite. Prozac, Wellbutrin have that effect. You might ask your doctor about those. So remember we need more strong young people like you in the world.  Go to university you will love it. I bet they have counseling for everything you've been through and support groups. Good luck at school!",1
I was diagnosed with depression at 12 and it was later changed to bipolar depression when I was 13. I ended up having severe panic attacks from the age of 17 to 21. I was also raped. My ex fiance's cousin (we were rooming with him at the time) raped me and my ex didnt believe me. I was kicked out in the middle of the night. It was cold and raining. My dad lived a 30 minute drive away. Im 25 now and married and am pregnant with our third child. I still relive my rape everyday even though it happened 5 years ago and my rapist stalked me for a very long time after that. But trust me. Life moves on and gets better. If you need to talk I am here.,1
Just remember things get better. It takes time. Don't put too much pressure on urself. Try exercise if u feel up to it. Healthy eating. Think bout ur new course which will keep you busy. I know it must be hard. Most of us been in v bad situations but it will pass. Try praying to God x,1

I am so sorry that you have been through so much at such a young age.  You can get through this.  You need a good doctor to work closely with you.   It may be that you will need to continue on medication and counselling  even when you feel better because going off to college and studying will be stressful and you will need to be able to cope.,1

My doctor told me ""well that was unwise bet you won't do it again "" but did not raise his voice or tell me off so please go chic.sending you hugs X x",1
Ty I doubt a pill wil fix my thoughts at all don't see how as I was straight up before w them and told them specific phrases running threw my mind..pills given never stopped these chemical imbalance...I dont see it though maybe im wrong..I seem to never find relieve and tried literally all options known even talking.to my dr ive known for years telling her that I self talk badly exact phrases to be exact n no thing...im giving up tired if this..even praying..no signs of happiness n relief ...im lost,1
This is normal with both 1 and 2. My dad got really bad at one point when he would think he's better and chopped my baby bed up into pieces while I was still in it.  I grow ul and have bipolar 1 and have a manic spending problem that left me bankrupt . You are not alone in this cycle.  If I'm off my meds for 72 hours I start freaking out and have panic attacks.  I would definitely see a new Dr.  That you feel comfortable with.  And check your blood levels too.  BC these meds mess up your liver too.,1
"Go to your doctor be honest, and stay on your meds. I'd be afraid to go off mine. I already have the slight over spending problems.  Every time you go off of them the harder to readjust. Do the right thing stay on your meds.!",1
"I can relate, I am currently having the problem of restlessness and needing to move but I also don't feel like moving. If you need to talk im here",1
"This sounds like a mixed episode. Were you on a mood stabilizer before you stopped taking your medicine? If you were, you may be having a rebound effect. It may take some time for the drug to rebuild to an effective level in your body: most psych meds aren't instant. Do talk to your doctor asap but don't panic!  I am the queen of mixed episodes and I speak from experience. Mixed episodes are intensely uncomfortable but they always pass! You won't feel like this forever. Try to sit tight, keep your hands busy, and fight the urge to do anything reckless or self-destructive. If you feel like jumping out of your skin, valerian tea is soothing and may help a bit til you can get to the doc. And in the future, if your meds are working, stay on them! Lots of luck.",1
"The best way to avoid the big rollercoaster ups and downs is to stay on meds all the time, especially a mood stabilizer. It's so hard, I fight it too, not wanting my diagnosis, or to need meds, but I know I'm better off stable. You have to make that appointment, and you need to go regularly. It helps so much. I'm glad you have a supportive husband. Mine has been amazing, even when I spent us into a crazy amount of debt or baked bread and cookies like a maniac on a four day sleepless bender. Good luck, and hugs.",1
I've not used lithium just quetiapine but stopped that as I was piling on weight and now the aripirazole - is there any other causes for it that you know of? I struggle around my period anyway because I've got endometriosis but never thought about the thyroid thing thanks for the reply I appreciate it ❤️ x,1
Werid are you on a mood stabilizer? Been under extra pressure?,1
You need to look after yourself. If he's not willing to see a psychiatrist or Doctor you should risk your own mental well-being to help him. Hugs x,1
if hes up & down all the time it can make ur moods go like that i was married for 19 yrs & my ex husband had me & the kids walking on egg shells all the time plus my childhood my dad  was   vioent to my mother including  drugs an alcohol both those times in my life left me with depression & severe anxiety being around toxic people can bring u down  i hope things get better but if his not willing to get help u should think about leaving him. my ex done same thing said same things about my friends since i left him iv been able to be myself happy for once .,1
"I understand, its hard. I had to get away from my boyfriend because he was always yelling and punching things with his anger issues and all and it made my depression and anxiety much worse,",1
"I don't think she's saying that she's ""catching"" schizophrenia or bipolar, but she can end up being depressed and anxious from dealing with his constant, complicated, paranoid, changeable, unmedicated mental states.  Just for the record, too, you can't catch schizophrenia, but his paranoia can eventually cause her to be paranoid as well.  If she's going to be his caregiver, she may need to get therapy for herself.  She may need medication for herself.  She may need support from a caregiver's support group.  She needs to seek assistance for herself.  She can't ""help"" him if she can't help herself.  After she's in a healthier state of mind and he's seeing her going to therapy, he may consider giving it a chance again himself.",1
"It's not a rational decision.  
It's a release from the pressure and anxiety, 
And sometimes from the numbing depression.  
It's being able to feel something... anything, when you feel nothing.
It's to validate anxiety and stress when there is no reason for it.  
It's an irrational grab for control over anything... even pain.
It's almost always regretted as soon as it starts.
But it rarely even can be stopped.
And it is almost never for ""attention.""
I understand, and you are not alone.    ",1
"Self harm is something we learn to do to cope with a ""pain"" or trauma that we either can't face or won't face ( sometimes we don't even know what it is, we've blocked it). It can actually release endorphins ( the body's own natural pain killer like morphine ) so even tho we feel a little pain from the cut we might actually feel
Good from the endorphins! So in a strange way we use it as a poor form of therapy. It helps us avoid a larger ""pain"" and it makes us feel better. The trick is to develop better coping techniques to help us feel better. And to find someone safe that we can divulge ( or discover) what the real problems are and then get better!",1
"No pressure tho. I am , after all , a stranger to you.",1
You need to see a psychiatrist asap. Get on some meds. There is help and support out there. My anxiety and depression was so bad I about gave up on life. Please see a psych dr. I pray you will be well. I finally gave in and sought help. It was hard but I had to do it.,1
I need this right now my fincee left me on friday to go back home . Been together for 16 years . My PTSD bi polar anxiety n depression is very high . I don't have a clue on what im doing half the time . I hate feeling so confused n worthless all the time . All I do all day is think about her and worry about her .,1
"When I'm anxious, it's because I am bipolar. When I'm depressed, it's because I am bipolar. I have zero control over either.",1
This isn't meant to demean anyone. For me anxiety has been caused from trying to control things out of my control that is happening around me or that I think will happen and the depression is caused by my sadness that things have happened and I can't do anything to change it. We all suffer differently. ~ S~,1
"Actually isn't that a Buddhist belief?  Now what you said is indeed true.  Thinking about and worrying about the future can lead to anxiety just as living in the past can bring about depression.  The thing is, we are extremists and anything or sometimes nothing can trigger these reactions.",1
I dread the future no reason to and I live my past over and over,1
I also have bipolar depression and anxiety... I think the best assistance you can provide yourself is to see another professional.  As you age your diagnosis can change as you as a person have changed.  Regardless seek some help medication will help you level out emotionally and take stock in what needs to be done.,1
"Hi  I suffer bipolar aswell and have emotionally unstable personality disorder, mine means that I'm impulsive and irrational it's to do with how your child hood impacts on your way of growing up for instance my dad was a drinker and beat my mother, my mother was cold and showed no emotion or love and other aspects of my life made it harder to let my emotions grow with becoming an adult you should asked your dr what kind of personality disorder you have and why she thinks that hope this has helped good luck with getting your answers x",1
"I had 8 sessions over 3 weeks this past June. My Psychiatrist had me stop because my short term memory was non existent. I am starting to get some back, but did not help with my depression and made my anxiety through the roof",1
There's a new medication being infused at the hospital I work at... ketamine therapy. Google it.... worth a shot if you're reluctant to shock therapy.,1
"It's been suggested to me to try ECT from my psychiatrist, but I have been hesitant due to the potential loss of memory... I am extremely resistant to most antidepressants/antipsychotics.... but for some people it has worked wonders!",1
"Or I get the 'you can't dwell in the past forever' or 'I've been there' when they don't have it, I hate especially the 'snap out of it'. If you think that'll work, you have no idea what I feel or go thru",1
Normal people can't comprehend how a seemingly happy person is a threat to themselves.. the isolation caused by fear of misunderstanding is deadly..,1
That's more like it. I feel like sometimes this is a place to wallow in depression and anxiety. An upbeat post is refreshing,1
"well, I've had two recorded heart attacks, and twice last eek I literally dreamt I was dying and awoke with severe chest pains...I live in Hell, isolated...my family, daughters hate me...I sacrificed my goals for them, never touched me, and I was too tough one my eldest, trying to protect her innocent soul, and now I am dying alone..they refuse, for 6 years, to speak to me, deny me meeting or hugging them again, or meeting my grandchildren...so I've gone off my  meds, refuse to kill myself, afraid of the legacy...but seek to die soon...without ever knowing love again, but escaping the horrible searing pain of depression...I at am my end!",1
fighting anxiety,1
Yeah. Anxiety is very hard to deal with. I take 2mg xanax 3 times daily and still have anxiety.,1
"May I ask what meds you're taking ? I just startedtaking fluxotine 4 days ago and I feel sick, suicidel and stressed out and don't really feel like being here in the world/:",1
I feel stressed out of my mind with this new medicine I just started 4 days ago/: I hate it!,1
It's ok. I've struggled with depression since I was a teenager. Just a lot worse now. Pray for my family please.,1
"oh, I did have side effects. uncontrolled twitches, inability to swallow, and I feel like something else, but the benefit greatly outweighed. I also have rhemetoid arthritis and it helped my pain.",1
Stay out of the casino and watch for other signs of risky compulsive behavior.,1
I had really bad anxiety on abilify. It also made me have really messed up nightmares.,1
"It works good for me, but it had the side effect of weight gain. I am currently off it under doctor supervision in order to help try and loose some of the weight since it is putting me at health risks.",1
I gained weight on abilify and had to take it in the morning bc it kept me up at night but it also made my anxiety spike through the rough. I am nlw taking valproic acid....see how that works out.,1
I had terrible side effects. Couldn't sit still. Was constantly shaking and amped up. It was awful. Got off immediately. Good luck   ,1
Take in the AM. It kept me awake all night when taken at night. I was put on it for night terrors due to ptsd and it has been 99% effective for me.,1
"Well, my doctor prescribed A. almost three years ago. The two previous years I had refused to be put on any so called moodstabilizer, lithium, lamotrigin/lamictal. But fell into one of my worst periods of depression. Abilify (I was very hesitant!), an anti-psychotic drug. WOW!! After a few weeks I felt life again! After yet a while, my energy shot through the roof. I felt very content, happy...too happy. Jitters - YES! After 3 months or so I was practically unable to be still. My body and my mind couldn't take it anymore. I lost weight very fast (which goes to show how very individual use of bp-drugs can manifest itself). Well, well that was that. Can still miss the good months on A. Don't dare to try it again. BUT, I know of comrades for whom A. turned out great. It surely can take a long time before one finds the best bp-drugs. By the way, I'm bp II and was diagnozed as an ""oldie"". Just 5 years ago - 55 now. (excuse my somewhat clumsy English, am Swedish)",1
I worry about the consequences of asking for help.,1
Well I was brought up that asking for help is a sign of weakness still struggle with this everyday,1
Don't be afraid of how you feel and ask for help it takes a strong brave person to ask for help. Not a sign of weakness that is just ignorance. Stay strong. ~ S~,1
"Try not to be afraid, you know you need them because they work, it will be well worth it. When you have children something magical usually happens, they consume so much of our time , and our thought process , especially when they are as young as your son revolves mainly on them. I don't think you will forget to take care of your sons needs by any means, it is clear he is your sunshine  I too was anorexic before my first born, after I had him it stabilized. Focus on the long term rewards if you can. Good luck to you!  ",1
At 15 mg it gave me horrible thoughts. Once they put me on a low dose which was 5 mg the thoughts were bearable and nearly went away. It's not to bad it helps ease the depression and stuff. Everyone is different though.,1
I was on 2mg and it changed my life for the better. My doctor was worried about my weight gain so now I'm on 1mg (I split the pill in half) And I am still pretty good although I have worse anxiety since lowering the dose but my doctor also doesn't want to go back up she wants to start gradually tapering me off at some point when I'm feeling really stable in my life,1
"2mg abilifly for me works great. I take at night. Started at 10mg and lowered the dose until I and my doctor felt it wasn't making me like a very quite person,which I am not..now for about 2years I have been at 2mg enjoying everyday right now Life is pretty good, my anxiety attacks have been few and far between. Personality is up I can get manic but I don't get depressed too bad anymore.  Hope your meds help you out like me just work on the dosage with your dr.,good luck",1
Hated it. It actually made my anxiety so high I was afraid to leave my apartment. Will never go back on it.,1
"After months of finding the right dose, I feel great! Side affect I have is weight gain but I knew that would happen. It's still easy to lose the weight I just need to exercise more and eat right. But mentally I have to have the right dose to feel better. I can't remember my dose, my mom is the one who controls my pills after a scare she had last year. Not related to abilify as I wasn't on it back then.",1
Gave me high blood pressure. They told me I could have had a stroke walking.,1
People make me feel guilty if I  try any of those,1
"Same, I think certain people in my life that once could not accept it are starting to. I am the one who places the guilt on myself after I say I can't do something due to my anxiety ect. Not fun, but in reality we have to take care of ourselves first.",1
"and me 
..maybe we start to think thst we arr letting people make us feel guilty. Or that we make ouselvrs feel guilty?? Eeasier said than done though!!!",1
"I am on that exact same dose, and I have severe anxiety attacks when I don't take them",1
"Have been on them now for almost two years, was the same way which is why I started. Only thing I found that stopped me crying, being anxious, depressed and stopped the unwanted thoughts and feelings. I still can't get through a day without them. Otherwise I'm a complete mess. Message me if you want :)",1
"I was on 250mg. If I missed one pill, I would lose my shit, I'd be emotional, snap very easily, I'd eat a lot more that day, I'd just be a total mess. I've been needing to start them again but I'm to scared of going through the first week with them settling in now I have a son.",1
"Same feeling.  I went up to 100 mg as I was juggling grad school, family with a daughter having mental issues and a full time job as a Ms teacher at a treatment facility.  I would cry from stress and anxiety.  Just graduated so starting to feel a little more even but I can even think about not taking my meds in fear I would drown in a deep dark hole.  I am lucky my husband understands.",1
"I hope you will come into contact with many others who understand on here. I'm sure people will confirm that many of the things you are thinking and feeling are common and 'normal'.  In no way are you a 'failure'.  I see ADs as merely a crutch to help you along the path to recovery.  It's definitely not a sign of failure, I would say exactly the opposite, you are aware enough that you just need some help.  It's a sign of strength and honesty. 
Many people need some form of help in their lives medically, mental illness is no different, our minds are so complex, sometimes they just 
don't work properly.  I do worry though if people begin to feel better, this is sometimes when we might feel we no longer need the ADs and come right off them, it is sometimes the case when people with a mental health condition feel that they are doing really well and begin to run before they can walk and possibly take on too much, coming off medication too fast or too soon might not necessarily work if some other challenge or difficult situation comes along in the longer term.  It's not a sign of weakness if we need them.

It sounds as though you ve had a lot on your plate being strong for your son, it can take so much out of a parent being there for those who rely on you, try not to be too hard on yourself, you ve done really well in acknowledging you need some help, accepting the condition is a huge step towards recovery when some can't admit they are suffering.  

Small steps are key to an eventual goal, lean on those who care for you and let people help you, you can do this, there is hope for us all xx best wishes x",1
Stop beating urself up. Needing meds does not mean u r weak and I'd certainly nothing to be ashamed of,1
Same here. I am off meds as they are not helping me in anyway. I am depressed from last 8 months. I am 54 and jobless from last 2 years. I left my job thinking my life will be stress free. But the depression never goes and I continue to live with Bipolar for eternity.,1
"Failed? At what? You will never not have bipolar/depression it what you are struggling with.  so if  you thought you could make it go away, then yes you failed to accomplish the impossible. Its not about never feeling depression or mania and never struggling -- its about managing your inner state so you can live well. 
So let's see -- you have several times come out if depression that can kill people, stuck with your crisis team a long time when you needed them, are raising a special needs child, recognized what was happening, did something about it, and... damn girl!! You are not failing at any single thing even a little! You are discouraged and maybe intimitated  but you are NOT a failure.",1
"There is no shame in taking meds. Im on. Sertraline aka zoloft too. Just started it 2 weeks ago from being on effexor xr for years. It seems to be working but it affects peeps differently.
Your only a failure when u fail to try!",1
"I know how you feel...you pick yourself up only to fall again. It's a struggle!  Bipolar is like that.  I try getting out in nature when I'm depressed or exercise, but sometimes you be so tired... I know...but you have to push yourself...think of yourself as a demanding coach for you to be better.  If you did it before you can do it again... Push Through.   ",1
You must be brave and do what it necessary. Perhaps some medication is wise during this difficult time. Take note of the side effects of different medications. Things will get easier. Just takes a bit of time. Rest when u can. Look after ur sons. Don't stress too much if poss or take too much extra on. Do what u need to look after children and esp urself x,1
I've been on Effoxor for over 20 years started at 75 im on 300mg along with othet anxiety meds.If u want to talk.....Let me no i just dont want to put all my business out there.Keep your chin up.,1
"I'm not sure why you got off. But I would see your doctor and start back on meds. Don't be afraid.  I'm sorry for what you are going through but now you need to think about yourself.  Get up tomorrow, shower, take a walk then next week call your doctor so this doesn't go on much longer for you. It sounds like you need the meds.",1
"Thinking of you and praying for you! For you, your family and your struggles.. Xo with lots of love and support!",1
"I suggest the book Loving Someone with Bipolar Disorder as a starting off point. Maybe go to counseling together. Your husband needs to understand your illness if he is to help you. In turn, it helps him and those three boys who didn't ask to be brought into this world or situation. If they are too young to understand that Mommy is sick, they're not too young to understand tension and strife between you and your husband. The two of you together owe it to them to do what you can to make this situation right. Good luck.",1
I would maybe travel. So that you can get away from your home stress and relax. Maybe take a close family member or friend with you. It will help clear your mind- plus it sounds like you deserve to treat yourself,1
Propranolol / seraquel / lamictal. It lowered my blood pressure,1
"I take both propanolol and Lamictal, and my doc and I are leaning towards a bipolar 2 diagnosis. The propanolol is essential for me for an internal tremble and keeps my blood pressure in mind. The biggest side effect I've noticed is my physical stamina is effected, less endurance, out of breath more easily. The Lamictal for mood stabilization for had not shown any side effects, and I've avoided the constant up and down moods since starting it a few weeks ago.. For me, the combination is essential and effective, with little side effects.",1
"I'm on 20-40mg propranolol twice a day for a minor hand tremor which my doctor and I believe is related to my PTSD and anxiety and so far it's seemed to help with minimal side effects.
I'm also on 150mg effexor in the morning; 400mg epilim twice a day, 7.5mg mirtazapine at night, 10-30mg endep at night and 25-50mg seroquel at night.",1
"I have taken propranolol as a PRN for anxiety and it worked well, and it didn't cause any drowsiness.",1
I'm on both one anxiety lamictl for bipolar one works great no side effects,1
"Propranolol is used for anxiety. It's actually a beta blocker, but my doctor has me on it strictly for anxiety! It works for me.",1
I currently take propanolol. It is a beta blocker primarily used to treat high blood pressure. I take it to lower my ♥ heart rate.,1
Propanolol/Inderal is a Beta blocker. It has multiple uses and potentially can reduce anxiety by reducing blood pressure. I take it as a migraine preventative.I have been taking Lamictal - in varying doses - for 13 years and it is a wonderful medication. One of my children has BP as well and has been on it for years. I have found the side effects to be minimal and the med to be highly effective.,1
"Hi I take Lamactil (as Lamotrigine) 200 mg a day - in one dose instead of 100 night and morning, as a mood stabiliser AND 225 mg or 300 mg of Efexor for depression and/or anxiety. Top up when not stable with 5 mg of Olanzapine (as Zyprexa) at night. Works in together well. Only downside is (in Aust anyway) they Lamictal isn't on the PBS (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) and the Olanzapine leads, usually, to lots of weight gain....",1
"I used to be on Lamictal, but was taken off because of bad side effects, but don't remember what.  And I've been on for quite some time Propranolol, which is actually a high blood pressure med, I believe, but not for anxiety or bipolar.  I'm on Lithium for the bipolar, which has given me permanent hand tremors, and the Propranolol is to combat them.  And I'm just so, so lucky (sarcasm) that the Lithium doesn't help the bipolar, and the Propranolol doesn't help the tremors.  Sorry I'm of no help.",1
Propranolol is a beta blocker that is used for heart arrhythmia but is also use for anxiety. It can also lower BP but very slightly,1
Propranolol made my blood pressure too low and Lamictal made my migraines worse and more frequent.,1
"I'm on lamictal, propanolol, and citalopram. It's a good combo for me. Propanolol takes away the physical symptoms of anxiety but not the thoughts.",1
Propanalol made my anxiety 10x worse and cause palpitations,1
propranolol works well with me. I'm also on abilify and lamictal. The only thing is that it does have a tendency on lowering your heart rate and blood pressure. So I do look out for that with my pulse oximeter (excluding blood pressure).,1
"I take lamactil for my epilepsy, Bibi also suffer from Manic depression/anxiety/PTSD and it works wonderfully with my other meds  ,anx it has kept me seizure free for almost a year now",1
"Oh I became a psycho on Keppra. Literally psychotic. Hearing voices, suicidal, homicidal. Seeing things. Paranoid. Angry all the time. My boyfriend didn't even want to come home. 

 I'm only on Topamax and wellbutrin now which has been awesome for me. Still having some seizures though; just not as often. But the mood stabilization is spot on. Keppra didn't stop them. Wasn't a good dose.",1
"Propanalol is a beta blocker. You can be anxious, yet your heart rate will not increase. I found it effective with no side effects",1
"I have to share this because we are talking about Lithium.  My brother was on a diuretic for high Blood Pressure and the psychiatrist put him on Lithium.  The two should have not been given together.  They together caused his kidneys to fail, but before they did he swelled up in his abdomen, legs, scrotum and private parts so much with water that water was seeping from his skin and his skin was splitting open.  A nursing home did not know what was going on.  He got admitted to a hospital and they called in a kidney specialist and he knew exactly which diuretic he was to have with Lithium.  On the right diuretic he lost forty pounds of fluid.  They were killing him with the wrong meds.",1
I stopped lithium suddenly in pregnancy and was ok but it is v risky. Look out for signs of relapse and seek help urgently. Or re start meds,1
"Can you find another psychiatrist? I would suggest doing that. I know it's frustrating to be on meds, but if you've found that they help you have every right to get that help. Can you contact your primary care doctor? (I apologize if others have already written the same thing. I haven't read all the comments yet.) I wish you the best! Don't be afraid to advocate for what you need. As a human, you have a right to have someone help you with your mental illness. Please take care and update us if you get a chance. I care even though I don't know you.",1
"Frankly, it was irresponsible of your Dr to stop your meds quickly like that. He should have given you warning that he would be leaving his practice and arranged to fax your files to a new dr to continue your treatment. The withdrawals can be super awful, and agitate your condition immensely. Disassociation, depression, appetite fluxes, suicidal thoughts/feelings, nausea/vomiting, and several other things just off the two drugs you mentioned.

That being said, you need to see a new Dr asap. Even if you have to see your primary care Dr for a months refill while you find a new psychiatrist. Your medication should only be stopped under Dr supervision for YOUR benefit, NOT because a Dr is leaving. Playing yo-yo w your meds is dangerous. If your primary care Dr won't refill, you can seek out an urgent care Dr or an emergency room visit. They can verify w the pharmacy of your prescriptions and lack of refills if you no longer have your pill bottles.

P.S.- I have found the effexor tablets have easier withdrawal symptoms than the capsules, you just have to take them more often. May be something you want to ask about. 

And the above person's comment about smoking pot..... Let me say that I am NOT encouraging you to do anything illegal, but if it is legal in your state/area, I would suggest using it while your meds get back into your system. It easing your anxiety alone would be helpful. But please don't use alcohol, your liver and kidneys are going through enough w the meds.",1
"Lithium withdrawal happens quickly with dissociative states, messed up blood pressure, dizziness, disorientation, lightheadedness, confusion, and after a few weeks possible organ failure. 

Effexor withdrawal takes 6-9 days to kick in and includes tremors, hot flashes, chills, sweating, fatigue, inability to sleep, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, severe headache, and sudden severe depression (typically worse than your depression was to begin with)

I was on lithium 1200mg for 8 years and experienced withdrawal once after 3 days when my mom was in the hospital for 3 days and only she had access to my meds (they were locked up). 

I've been on Effexor for about 3 years now and experienced withdrawal once after 6 days when I was put in jail for 10 days (for missing community service) and they took 6 days to get my meds ordered. 

Both I was warned about when I was put on he meds in the first place of the importance of not missing them or letting myself run out because these withdrawal problems are real and intense. And I experienced every single withdrawal symptom both times except with the lithium I wasn't off long enough for organ failure to set in.",1
Prudence Lowe Benjamin yeah while I was here a woman had a seizure due to them not getting her Lamictal ordered in a timely matter. Due to that I got my Lamictal sooner than any other because I made a big deal about the chick almost dying because of missing it and I was like two days behind her on my missed doses and started panicking,1
I came off Effexor to fast and was sick for a week. It was horrible.,1
Also why be reluctant to Effexor? Lithium is the most dangerous psychiatric drug out there and you are on that so why be reluctant to one as harmless as Effexor?,1
Prudence Lowe Benjamin it's pretty safe as far as any research I've done on it. For adults anyways...I'm 8.5 months pregnant and my OBGYN told me the only real risk was cleft palate and a minuscule risk of a heart murmur but nothing to worry about. I still didn't like the idea of the risks and weaned myself off ASAP but it was too late and my daughter has to be born at a special hospital because she has 6 severe heart defects and two organs are in the wrong place. I did more research on my Lamictal and Effexor with pregnancy effects and sure enough Effexor is a lot worse than they said it was. Can even cause part of the baby's skull and brain to be completely missing or formed outside of the body. It's horrible for babies but so far still seems pretty safe for adults,1
Brenda Chapman also I never said lithium didn't work. It is PROVEN to be the most dangerous. You disagree that's your problem and if you die of lithium toxicity due to your ignorance about the dangers of it that's on you. Lithium worked amazingly for managing my bipolar anger. It works amazingly for most people but that doesn't mean it's worth the risks. All I stated was that it was the most dangerous and Effexor is proven one of the least likely to give side effects. You can disagree with those facts all you want but that's just ignorant.,1
"I hated Effexor. Just finished weaning off completely last month. I gained a lot of weight, became more agitated, manic, and my cravings for alcohol came back. I had terrible nightmares, increased anxiety, and had a dizzy feeling when taking it. Worst medication I have ever tried. Was up to 225mg. That's just my experience.",1
I respectfully disagree with ur comments regarding both lithium and Effexor. Lithium is the first medication I have been on that is starting to help stabilize my mood since I was diagnosed 5 years ago. Effexor SUCKS! I was initially put on it for depression. It made me so irritable and agitated that I turned into a raging bitch. I almost lost my job as a result of it.,1
"Heather Morrissey I don't recommend lithium. It's terribly dangerous, ruins your kidneys, and is so terrifying to be on. God forbid you are in the sun too long or don't drink enough and it can kill you. It does terrible things and I found that Lamictal helped just as much so I asked to be taken off lithium",1
"I've never been on lithium, YET. I say that because that could be next..I've been on probably over thirty different Meds & combinations. A lot have dissociative withdrawal symptoms.. It gets sooooo confusing after so long. I got a heart condition with one that can be deadly, but goes away when you stop it..I'm getting tired    I can't tell  so I just go to my Dr.. And report side affects to Mental Health. Sad someone would leave a client without a referral..not good.",1
This is what scares me about getting back on meds. A doctor wouldn't just tell a diabetic to stop taking their insulin. I am constantly going back and forth over the struggle to find the right dosage or trying to trust a Dr again. It's so frustrating.,1
"My God! Any doctor worth their degree would gradually cut you back on your meds, not tell you to stop completely. Having you stop such a high dosage of Lithium so quickly is absolutely dangerous, as well as just stopping the Effexor. It is within your best interest to either go to your local ER to get back on your meds ASAP or get an appointment as quickly as possible. You will crash and it won't be pretty. I'm not trying to scare you but I had my dr do the same thing to me in '95 and I ended up in a psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt. If I can help you or anyone else from ever going through what I did....please take this advice and the advice of everyone else who has posted a response. Good luck! :)",1
"1) stop sign... realize that is your anxiety that is giving you the hit the fan feeling and out of body type thing is called disassociative (sp) disorder, both are to be expected as well as nausea and appetite changes possibly dizzy and lightheaded
2) find another doctor fast, if you have to go to a clinic like red Rock or north care even dhs should have some resources for you to help speed things up
3) smoke some pot I'm sure I'm gonna come under fire for this but it does help with the agitation and anxiety.  Not so much the depression but it doesn't sound like you have that at the moment.  
Please take care.  If you need to get to a hospital for a couple days please don't wait.  I hope this helps you and others have great ideas as well.  We are all here for you.",1
"Chanel Chartrand, not to be argumentative, as I'm sure lithium withdrawal plays a role in disassociation. But it is not solely due to lithium withdrawal. This is an issue I have dealt with since before beginning lithium, and it was usually when my anxiety was at it's peak. I have definitely noticed it happens easier now of i forget my meds now that my body is accustomed to getting lithium and effexor (and other meds) on a regular basis. Lessening the anxiety does have the potential to help lessen dissociative spells. This is just me speaking on my personal experience, as we are all obviously very different and react differently to meds/withdrawal/situations. Smoking pot would help the anxiety and probably the nausea as well, while the person gets their meds back into their system and gets leveled out.

Also, I totally agree about how quickly the lithium withdrawal can happen. If your meds schedule gets off due to being sick or running out of meds, it can mess you up in a heartbeat. This poor person is probably hanging by a thread right now due to how the meds were stopped. :(",1
The weed does help. I'm not saying sit around all day and smoke but just to ease the anxiety.,1
"If you need to go for a 72 hour eval, they can get you a new doctor. Horrible that you were left like that, happened to me. If you need to go to your primary care doctor, that is who helped when my doc, bailed. Then found new doc.",1
Where I live there is a 6 month to a year waiting list to even see if the psychiatrist is taking in patients with bipolar. My G.P. is totally useless when it comes to thing like mental health. But I guess I could go in to the emergency and wait 12+hrs...which just steams my anxiety. Thanks for all the wonderful comment and advise. Sure am getting sick of this almost mind game for patient who need treatment immediately:/,1
"I believe it.  I've had so many shitty psychiatrists in the last twenty years.  In fact, my last one, who was really old okay, told me on a wednesday that he was retiring; he was horrible anyway, the most he ever saw me for was exactly eight minutes; on friday morning news, there he was in orange, being led into a courtroom...get this...for child pornography.  Good doc huh, ?",1
"Yes, especially now. I  make myself get out of the house for a bit to keep from having panic attacks. Or worse.",1
Often I know I irritate my folk here most of the time,1
"Try to remember when making your appointment that you aren't committing to taking anything just by making the appointment. You will have time to talk with the prescribing doctor about some of your fears and feelings.  ONLY after discussing these things will you need to decide if this is the right route for you. Most likely, meds won't be the only recommendation. Some form of therapy, group or individual, will be helpful with modifying your thought processes about the best way to take care of you. Maybe your boyfriend can go with you to help with that conversation. Then, if you decide to take medication, please be patient. It takes some time to figure out if it's the right one (or combo) for you. I will say that meds have saved my life in the past. I still get cranky sometimes about having to take meds and I get cranky that I still have to work with therapists or groups for my particular illnesses (Why can't it just be one or the other??). But, these efforts far outweigh how lousy I feel when my illness is in charge of me. I hope this helps you. Best of luck in your journey. Be well <3",1

I am rapid cycle bipolar 1 and have been diagnosed in 2008. Yes it has been a rollercoaster but it is a manageable illness if that gives you hope. I continue to struggle when i take my meds i resent it but i know that i need to in order to remain stable and live a balanced life. You can either choose to be healthy or remain a victim to your moods which trust me is not fun and dangerous. Take that first step and find a doctor you are comfortable with and talk to a therapist about your feelings with this new diagnosis. You will be fine and that is the great news. Good luck and feel free to message me with any questions or concerns,1
I was so scared to see my new pschy doc I cried when he walked into the room. He was so nice & comforting he spent a lot of time answering all my questions.  I write down all my questions on a sheet & give it to him then he goes through them one by one.  Now I love my monthly appointments & my husband always comes in with me.  Good luck.,1
Don't be afraid of your diagnosis. Be happy you have gotten one and can now begin to understand your moods and how to manage them. This is the beginning of something better for you!,1
"I really struggled with the idea that I'd have to take meds for the rest of my life to be 'normal'. It's 3.5 years since my diagnosis and I still do sometimes.

Remember that you don't suddenly have bipolar, this isn't something new. It's just that now you have a name for it. The meds aren't so much about 'normality', after all everyone is a little strange. Instead think of it as allowing you to function so you can be the best version of you. I could wander around without my glasses, despite being very short sighted. It's possible but would make my life so much more difficult. Instead, I wear my glasses, and I'll have to wear them for the rest of my life. This isn't really any different.",1
Anxiety can cause us to put off making appointments. I have found if I make a plan the day ahead and have the number ready it helps. For me planning everything ahead eases my anxiety.,1
"I have bipolar and anxiety. 17 years. And as of past 8 months anxiety has been super bad, trying to find a new dr. Appointments can cause you to stress or upset you, but in the end the only way you're going to get better is with help from a dr. Appointments aren't always fun, but they usually end up being painless and you'll realize you got worked up over nothing.",1
"I lost my fiancé to overdose last August, he died in my arms. I understand what you're feeling; that unending pain, the thoughts that creep in when you're at your weakest, the crippling anxiety of having to deal with anyone or anything. I go to therapy, sometimes 2x a week and sometimes once a month, I'm on medication and that helped keep me from self harm and help stabilize my moods. The best advice I can give is to think that even in your darkest hour, you're loved one would want you to live, live for them. I've recently been able to smile instead of cry when I think of my fiancé, I know you don't want to hear it but time takes time. This is going to hurt for a very long time before it gets better. Some days you're going to want to call it quits, in those times change your surroundings, go for a walk, a drive, or even sir in your backyard. I used to sit in a daze in my backyard staring at the stars to calm myself down. Keep taking your meds, go see a therapist, and most of all hang in there, there's always a better tomorrow if we can just hang in there. Feel free to message me if you ever want to talk❤️",1
Thank you for sharing about your struggles. I'm sorry you lost someone so dear to you. I was on epival 1000mg for a long time. It helped stabilize my mood but I found it left me feeling depressed a lot. I found that I needed an anti-depressant as well. Everyone is different and it can take a lot of time and trying diff medication combos. It's really hard to stay patient and hopeful while going thru it. Talk with your doctor- be open and honest about what you're dealing with.Above all don't give up no matter what- you can treat this and find your groove. All the best!,1
"I'm married to a toxic person. It's so hard listening to complaints about my sleep or being ""lazy"". Constantly bringing up a friendship I had that made me feel good but he hated. Calling me names... timing me when I leave. I am not allowed to go out with anyone. It's a horrible life to live.",1
"One thing I will say because no one else seems to have the ability to say it.....""What we see in others is sometimes how we view ourselves. Past or present They are mirror images of who we were at one time or who we feel we might start to become and if we do not allow ourselves to look for anything good in someone, we will only see the bad. How we allow others to affect us is on us and our own conscience. Most times what people say to us we may see as a slam against us and we feel guilty which is why we react to it as we do. But, if we look deep within ourselves we will maybe see a little truth to it and no one seems to be able to handle viewing themselves as the bad person. It doesn't mean we should give up and lose ourselves deeper into darkness, it simply means we should search further into ourselves and find a way to become a better person. No one is perfect, not one person. We all have flaws but taking to heart what others say to us may either be who we really are or who they really are. Arguing with people or claiming you are more righteous than they are leaves hurt feelings and damaged egos. You can't help fix a situation by yourself but you can't expect others to do all the work either. No one should bow down to each other but it doesn't hurt to discuss feelings in a calm and loving manner either. Anger, yelling and screaming gets us no where with each other.",1

"Sometimes we need to just be left alone for a minute. And thats ok. And sometimes we can be misinterpreting good intentions and helpful words. Either way, i think if you feel overwhelmed then its a good time to take a step back from everyone. Altimtly they are your family and they do love you. I can write a book on family drama, ive been told as much lol. Sometimes they dont kno how to love us in the ways we need it. So like i said, take your.time off, but dont cut them off completely, my advice.",1
"Meds are half of it, a person must do the work to get well. I've been suffering from mental illness for more than half my life now, and I can tell you I was where she's at. It will be uncomfortable, but to get better you have to do what it takes. I went to counswling, and a counselor that could problem solve, not just listen to me be a victim of the world. I learned everything I could, and am still learning about my mental illness. I have learned how to cope. Some days are still hard, but I want to be a productive member of society, so I do what it takes. Yes, I'm on meds and yes they help. Never give up! :)",1
"I have 8 kids, five steps, all severely traumatized by life with mom/stepdad. I watched two slip into addiction. It was very bad with one, she just wouldn't get help. We tried everything. Over and over again. Until they are ready to take their meds and go to their appointments and do the work? We can't carry them. It's heartbreaking. But good ending. Now she's 3 years clean, doing great in college, on meds, stable. She had to want it. Just be there for her, and push her in the right direction. If she's ever a risk to herself, do everything in your power. That's what finally motivated my girl to move forward for herself. If she's still a teen, you can force her to take meds and do appointments. But, after that? It's on them. Good luck.",1
"For me... meds were a merry-go-round.  It can take a long time(years even) to find the right combo.  In my state, WA, mental health diagnosis is enough to get you on the state's Medicaid program (aka Obamacare) and DSHS.

I look at meds and mental illness like type  2 diabetes... the pills initially help get it under control... then you focus on a healthy diet and exercise as part of your management plan in addition to your regular check ups - you can eventually go off the diabetes meds if you get your condition under control... for me that translated into good sleep hygiene (super important mood swing trigger), a reduction in inflammatory foods, abstain from alcohol,  proper vitamin levels (checked via blood test by my doctor) known to be linked to depression and mental illness (deficiencies in vitamin D, B vitamins, etc.), some sort of exercise like walking or recumbent bike (where you can 'zone out' and practice positive self mantras ""I am worth this effort"", ""I am not my illness and my illness doesn't define who I am"") and intensive therapy/counseling 1x/wk which eventually became needed only 1x/mo, learn how to handle stress and life events that can trigger an episode. 

I went from rapid cycling to practically stable and medication free.. took me the better part of 4yrs.

I struggled all through my childhood (knew something was 'wrong' with me since I was 12) until I hit 30 and decided to take control of my life because I couldn't keep going the way I had been living.  I struggled all through my 20's with a wrong diagnosis of depression and insomnia and improper meds.  Things changed when I got the right diagnosis.

Another thing to keep in mind... Bipolar and other mental health disorders usually have co-morbid disorders and components that may not appear until later in life or be hidden by the primary and initial diagnosis.",1
Take her phone away. I know that sounds extreme but without it to distract her she will get bored and start doing things like looking for a job. Make a role if she is going to live with you that she has to take meds. Lastly don't enable her. My parents did all 3 and though I was really upset at first it helped in the long run. Maybe consider yoga or meditation. I can understand her position as I have bipolar and really struggled and still do sometimes to be adult. Ultimately it's going to come down to her will. If she wants better things in her life than you have to put in work. Or go the lazy way and put her on disability. Just don't cave and not do anything.,1

"Carrie, the motivation issue is something I still struggle with from time to time.  At 17, I just wanted to be left alone to do my own thing, which wasn't healthy for me at all.  Thank goodness my parents were proactive about pushing me to do things and that my doctor was amazing in helping me work through things.

It may not be what you want to do, but some tough love may be in order here.  If your son can get a jump start to his motivation, it may spur him onward with things.  He does have to have the want to get better and do what it takes though.  I would suggest that you talk to his doctor and maybe even a counselor to get some ideas on how to help your son.  They should be able to give you support along the way as well, since you've probably got a difficult road ahead of you.  Mental illness isn't very kind to begin with and adding teenage hormones to the mix makes it that much more difficult.",1
"Seroquel is notorious for weight gain.  I had horrible side effects from Effexor, but it is highly individual.   Gabapentin isn't that high, I started at 600 or 800 and went up to 1200 day.",1
Neurotin is used for many issues from mood stabilizer to preventing seizures and restless legs. Not pain however.,1
Horrible experience,1
"I had horrid side effects from sertraline, as did my son.

We both immediately stopped the sertraline. 
In saying this i know many other people that take it with no issues.",1
"It took me 3 weeks to settle, of course the first few weeks you go right down, as in you become the worst you never thought possible. After that, I found it helped me manage my anxiety attacks better and with the help of a lot of therapy, I managed to control when I had them a lot of the time. I never relied on the pill as I need to put the work in to help myself also, but it did help me when I was learning how to control myself.",1
"I find them great, helped with my bipolar 2 and no more panic attacks , no side affects for me .",1
"Didn't do much for me..all it did was make me really hungry at night time, enough to disturb my sleep + gained a ton of weight from it & worsened my depression",1
I've been on it twice in my life both times for about a year but the side effects were horrid.. Didn't ease up much even with time so I took myself of it this time and the withdrawal was horrid and I'll never take it again.  And I'm sick of hearing drs say this drug doesn't have withdrawals because they were worse then any anti depressant I've ever been on and I've been on a lot of them.,1
At times.. I live in CO and have been recently trying different strains of pot for depression and anxiety.,1
Gave me panic attacks,1
I was in fluoxetine (Prozac) for years and out of the blue had a reaction.. Mood swings..self harm.. Suicidal thoughts..anxiety..shakes.. Sweats... I was told sertraline was not as harsh.. I've been on them four years.. The first week was hard as above I became depressed.. But now I'm even.. No ups or downs.. I've spent 2years training to be a counsellor passed level 2 and 3 counselling skills... If I hadn't switched I don't know what would have happened...,1

"I take buspar for GAD, Lithium for mania and Latuda for depression. This is the right combo for me. I feel amazing. Finally after 18 years I found the correct combination. I have bipolar 1, GAD, and social anxiety disorder.",1
"I have TRMD with severe anxiety, my Dr. had me on busporin for quite a while, 10mg 3 times a day - it actually worked okay for a fair period. I have to say in all the time that I took busporin, when it was working - it was just fine for me.

Anyone on here have any more information on Fetzima? I posted a question about this before - and someone was kind enough to put their experience as a reply - was just wondering if anyone else had any input on it?",1
"Actually, I really appreciate you asking Valeda!
Basically, I am prescribed a medication which, if it works, the effects only last a limited amount of time. This time limit can be as short as a month or as long as 3 - but never usually more than that amount of duration. I have been on so many different medications that my dr. is basically running out of things to prescribe. In my last few sessions, he has suggested that I should consider Electric Convulsive Therapy - which I won't do as I've done a fair amount of research and feel that the risk brain injury from this type of therapy is not something I am willing to risk for myself.",1
"Buspar (or busperin) is a non-addictive alternative to more traditional meds like Valium or Klonopin. I've been on it off and on for a couple of years. It's been very effective in treating my GAD, but it stops working if you take it very consecutively. It's not an antidepressant. It was made specifically for people with anxiety disorders. It shouldn't cause mania or exacerbate it in any way. At most, you will feel a little dizzy. If this occurs, then take a half of one instead of a whole one.",1
"Great post. I am currently weaning off remeron on to effexor, And was scared . But I'm following all the Dr said.",1
"Yes!!! When ending one med, you have to be weened off. And not taking any at all, is soo soo soo dangerous and scary. I will be the first to admit that there is no miracle pill and its not just about taking the right meds. YOU are your best advocate to getting better. But we are sick, and need the meds too",1
You make a very good point. It has actually been concerning me for quite some time. I usually recommend chatting to their dr. Different meds c work differently with different people and can cause different side effects. I have bipolar I and anxiety and it took me 18 mths this time around to find the right combo but I'm doing well and working a full time job. I also have chronic pain which effects my mental health but a tweek in my doses and I'm doing well.,1

What's a study? Confusing,1
Have my alarm clock set on my telephone to take my meds,1
"I struggled for about 20 years with the idea of ""having to take meds for the rest of my life,"" so I'd take them for a few months and once I felt ""normal"" I would wean myself off them so I could be ""normal."" Every single time within 4 or 5 months I'd end  up in the hospital for one self harm situation or another. Even after that I wouldn't take the meds and would end up in a long term rehab within 3 years as a result of trying to self medicate with a barrage of different substances... Buy into the hype of anti medication, or jump on the band wagon of anti big time pharmaceuticals, but I've been taking my prescribed medication daily, as prescribed by my doctor, and haven't been hospitalized or taken street drugs / obsessive amount of alcohol since... When I tried to be ""normal"" by avoiding my medication I ended up acting abnormal.. Now that I'm staying on my medication I live the most normal life I've ever lived before... Just say'n.",1
"Ginger Right It's a struggle, but my experience has been that it's a lot harder to fight the daily troubles outside of my control without the medication. Medication isn't a ""cure all,"" but once I decided to stop listening to that internal demotivational tape that has always played repeatedly in my head about how weak I am that I to need medication, or how society is right about how I'm foolish to think I need medication, then I started to realize that these meds improve my quality of life, and more important than that; it improves the quality of life for my wife and four children... Don't let the thoughts that have always tried to destroy you keep you from doing something that helps you live.",1
"Austin: I've been working with my doctor, and it took almost a year and a half of trying to figure out what works best with my chemical make up (because everybody is different, and the same regiment that works for me might not work for you) we have found that a mood stabilizer daily, and a stimulate when needed helps me to manage my daily life without falling into an emotional pit of despair. While we were trying to figure out what works best for me we tried a medication that caused visual hallucinations, but I contacted him and he imminently discontinued that medication and got me in the same week to make sure I was alright. It's important to note that although that was not a pleasant experience I didn't give up hope because I reminded myself that the goal was to get better and only rarely when trying to figure out the best way to do something is it ever gotten right on the first try. Even when I started taking the medication that I'm using today I had to deal with stomach discomfort (constipation / weight gain) but I counter acted those side effects by changing my diet and forcing myself to start exercising. A funny thing about that is that I started taking a natural probiotic (extremely healthy and all natural) supplement to help with the constipation and for the first week I felt like I had to use the restroom ALL the time even when I didn't have any stool to dispose of.
One thing to keep in mind is the fact that you're going to feel different, but that's the point. Some side effects can be a sign that you're on the wrong medication, but other side effects can be manageable as long as you're willing to put in the work. I've been working with my doctor, and for the past five years I've been on a regiment that helps me, and haven't had to suffer any of the side effects that came with not taking the medications... Such as hospitalization / self harm / suicidal thoughts... I hope that answered your question, and sorry if it was a bit long winded, but I'm working on a book at the moment so I get into writing and it's difficult to stop.",1
I'm looking at getting all medication regularly myself after going back and forth on it. How many years straight have you been taking it Christopher and have you had any major side effects that were a problem? That is one thing that I worry about.,1
I got Stephen Johnson syndrome.  Horrible,1
I was allergic. Not just a little allergic but the life threatening allergy they warn you about. I got Stephen Johnson's syndrome. So my exposure was very short.,1
"I haven't had problems with it. It does so much; helps with ocd is the main thing, but also with anxiety and lots of others that I don't remember right now!",1
Was taking a high dose & had night terrors & sweats for 6 months (worst 6 mths of my life!) & my psychiatrist said it wasn't lamical but against his opinion I decreased by 50mg & its fine.,1
"The rash is the main thing, I got it but was also lowering off epilim while starting lamactil, which shouldn't be mixed. A while down the track  I'm back on lamactil/lamotrogine and no rash. Just make sure they go very slow in raising doses. It helps my mood ( I'm bp2) the irritability and swings but I also take Zoloft for depression.i found for me it was one that didn't stack on the weight. I'm now on 400mg 200 night and 200 morning.",1
I got seroquel after that and it worked wonders. Should have got it first maybe. It was scary   ,1
"Word! In my case fatigue, insomnia, guilt the hardest to handle. And judgement...but not other's my own",1
"My daughter started on fepakote at age 16. She did ok but, when she started lithium things changed for the better. Even she recognized the change and gets upset if a Dr. Wants to take her off lithium.  Everyone and every MD is different",1
"The Depakote is most likely to help. It is a mood stabilizer which is the hallmark of treatment for initial treatment for bipolar. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant. Based on my knowledge and experience, I believe that antidepressants should not typically be prescribed for bipolar because it puts you at a higher risk of developing mania.",1
Every one does different on the drugs. But the main thing is don't be afraid of them.  Keep a journal when you start your meds to keep track of the side effects. It might take a month to start seeing positive results. But don't stop taking them. I've been on meds for 9 years and we finally have a combination that works best for me.  And yes get blood work done. My doctor has me mine checked every 6 months for tegretol levels.,1
depakotes a weight gainer but theres meds to counteract that but dont be alarmed unless ur already overweight alot,1
"Can't speak for the first two,  but the last;  matrazipine quiets the mind and makes you sleepy and more relaxed, has helped me sleep without anxiety (mostly).",1
"My weight gain was minimal to the point of non mentionable. But the breast changes were awful, led to a serious breast infection and cancer scare. :( otherwise though it was a great fit drug wise.",1
"I have literally been on every single ""mood stabilizer"" on the market. I gained weight with all of them... some more than others... 
And it is not just serotonin and appetite! They mess up your metabolism! So even if you eat healthy and limit calorie intake, it will still make you gain weight. They are right, every med has a different effect on different people, some people even claim to have lost weight.
But I agree... weight gain is definitely not insignificant!! It is a huge thing, and it affects your mood, your depression, your anxiety, and mostly your self worth!! (And really self worth is a part of all the others...)
P.s. I gained a TON of weight on risperadal!",1
"I've been on a low dose at times, and so was my son. In me, it caused a small increase in appetite and a few pounds of weight gain. Not even five. In him, in hugely increased his appetite and they changed his meds. But the benefit of having moods and anger - irritability controlled? Worth it. I do recommend getting your prolactin levels checked if you're on it any real length of time. It can cause them to rise, resulting in those side effects others discussed.",1
"I'd rather deal with irritability than gain more weight. I'm already dealing with metabolic issues related to Hashimoto's that have caused weight gain. Gaining weight will not help my irritability or mood, of that I can assure anyone who thinks weight gain is an insignificant side effect.",1
"This! ... I have literally been on every single ""mood stabilizer"" on the market. I gained weight with all of them... some more than others... 
And it is not just serotonin and appetite! They mess up your metabolism! So even if you eat healthy and limit calorie intake, it will still make you gain weight. They are right, every med has a different effect on different people, some people even claim to have lost weight.
But I agree... weight gain is definitely not insignificant!! It is a huge thing, and it affects your mood, your depression, your anxiety, and mostly your self worth!! (And really self worth is a part of all the others...)",1
"I don't know about weight gain but I was highly allergic. Slurred my speech, and raised my mania and anxiety so high I had to go back to the hospital more than once because it took so long to get out of my system and made me so difficult to be around.",1
Docs have tried hard for so many years. Finally settled on anti anxiety and sedatives. Now I'm a zombie,1
"I feel for all of you. I have had separation anxiety, depression and bipolar II since I was very young. Of course face in the late 60s, 70s, and early 80s Drs. were just figuring out what depression was. I have been on every medication that they have come up with. I had a fairly good luck with Lexapro. I have major panic attacks often. I  now on 20mg of Trintelex. I do a lot of sleep hypnosis. Haven't been able to work and for some reason I can get SS Disability.",1
I switched from sertraline to citalopram. The transition was a low but I am beginning to feel a change. I was on 150 mg of sertraline daily and still felt anxious.,1
"50 mg is usually starting dose. Def talk w dr. Go to psychiatrist not family dr. Also try to find dr who is updated on newest research on bipolar spectrum. The latest diagnosis in new DSM5 is major depression w mixed episode which means mood swings basically. Important cuz lots of people get diagnosed w depression/anxiety for yrs b4 a dr sees that its really a mood disorder which medicstion is different that just an anti depressant. Usually a mood stabilizer is added and works wonders. 
But if this is first time on meds u prob on way too low dose of zoloft.",1
Ya it happens i sometimes need to take sleeping pills or anxiety reliever bt now i ve been taking it continuously for a month and nobody knows about it,1
"I totally know what you mean. The guilt you have after snapping at someone is awful. Just know it's not your fault. I have recently been diagnosed with Bipolar and I am on 200g of lamotragine, citrolapram and valium used only as a back up med just in case I go up or down to control my mania and depression. So far so good. We are all not alone here in our battle. X",1
"I recently had a bad episode and had a date ...I thought I was OK with him but the day I was upset and crying and he said I lead him on..
So yes I do know how much it hurts...he told me he was councillor so felt safe with him
So now I'm thinking I am a very judge of character...it's mad how you feel afterwards....you feel awful...",1
Absolutely...don't stress...it is a matter of the right meds mixed with a healthy diet and some pot maybe???  Helps with anxiety.,1
"Yvonne Sands hello(:  so far they make me feel crazy/: I use to take celexa but for some reason when I would take it in the morning around 5'oclock at work it would ware off and it felt like my brain friend. I was off pills for 3 years but now I have to take something, I'm scared it'll get worse for me/: how's life been for you without medicine ?",1
"Hi there ive been on them for depression there an ok tablet ,not on anything at the moment , it helps me to keep stress out of my life x",1
"I think having bipolar you actually have to go through those ups and downs, different meds, therapy, and sometimes even inpatient treatment.  It's a struggle that will never disappear, but what helps me the most is faith in God and positive thinking... someone told me to find what makes me happy and pursue it.  I'm still struggling....even gave up on God... lost relationships... isolated myself to the point of having social anxiety... afraid of people... I just put on a mask and fight the days ahead with positive thinking...some days are good and some days are bad, but I thank God I made it through. Spreading love and courage to you  ",1
Fluoxetine worked great for my depression but made my anxiety worse. Sending prayers and love,1
"Please talk honestly, with your doc about your anxiety. I'm on 20 mg of fluoxetine also and it's the level I need. But my friend I think you need a bit higher dose. Also please seek counseling. Talking to an objective professional is EXTREMELY helpful!  There are professionals to help you. Seek help. You are worth it!!!",1
Are you seeing a Dr on a regular basis? You need to open & honest with the Dr & tell them how much you are struggling. You could also ask about counselling services that might be available to you so you can work on some strategies to help you feel more in control. Blessings   ,1
"Try wax. My friend uses it and she has really bad anxiety and it really works for her. Just get a medical marijuana card, and you're good.",1
"i was on 20mg fluox same as u. then more shit happened. they upped my dose to 40mg, and also put me on 50mg seroquel (which is supposed to help sleep as well-- mine doesnt), so i got put on 10-20mg temazepam to make me sleep, which doesnt always work. and recently got put on 6-12mg valium bc even more shit has happened.
dont be afraid to go back to your doctor and say it isnt working completely or u feel like u need to change or something more. also recomended to me and alot of ppl i know are on avanza (anti-dep that makes u sleep)",1
"Yes I do that alot, wake up heart beating out my chest n awful sweats n panic attack!!",1
"Hugs. My daughter has sleep anxiety. It took years to get her to sleep normally, it's still an issue. Severe PTSD in her case. I feel for you. It's heartbreaking when you can't find peace even in sleep. I hope you find a med combo that works, and that you feel better throughout the day. Be well.",1
You might try Klonopin instead of Valium it last longer might help you make it through the night and I have so much anxiety and then you'll feel a little more refreshed,1
Latuda made me question life and gave me incredible anxiety. Tried. Topamax but hated the side effects. I'm bipolar 2 so I think I'm wanting to try a single medicine therapy. I've been reading on it and I would love to just take seroquel at night,1
"Yep, I've got Klonopin (Clonazepam), Lamictal, and Cymbalta on board. But, actually going to the doctor today as depression/anxiety have gotten worse lately.  Jill Jorgensen, I was wondering if Bipolar and BPD could co-exist. I knew it! Yay for us ... we get both :( Though I have Bipolar type 2. My best to everyone. You're not alone",1
"My heart breaks for you, sending you love, light and healing from South Africa. I am also living a nightmare with severe depression and anxiety an the lack of understanding and empathy by those around me never ceases to shock me....how I wish I was terminally ill then I'd know my hell would end soon.",1
"I'm not sure what you mean by ""sleep anxiety,"" but  I have awful insomnia from anxiety. And on the rare occasion I get some sleep, I have woken up because of anxiety. I wake up with awful chest pains and racing thoughts. I would say anxiety can def wake you up. Also, I know meds work different for everyone, but personally Wellbutrin gave me horrific anxiety. So if your anxiety got worse after starting Wellbutrin, you might want to talk to your dr about that.",1
"Yep, Welbutrin was an anxiety producer for me too. I've been thru so many med changes and trials it would make your head spin (or mine lol). Hang in there with the med changes until they find the right ones for you. I'm on Clonazepam at night, seems to keep the anxiety away and I sleep pretty well (at least better than before). Also, soft music/meditation can be so helpful.",1
"Yeah. I'd never had anxiety before I tried Wellbutrin. I know all drugs work differently for people, and it's probably a miracle drug for some, but that was the WORST drug reaction I ever had and it was scary and awful.",1
I'm sorry you are feeling so ill. Yes sleep anxiety can wake you up. Anxiety can really mess with sleep and can cause stomach upsets. Try looking up mindfulness. There are phone apps as well. It's a way to help treat anxiety. It helps me a lot especially if I start to flip out before bed. It's a way Of focusing on the present and leaving anxiety behind. All the best.,1
"Sadly this happens all too often. I only have 5 people I can depend on, 3 of those being family members. Unfortunately this disorder brings us to be more attached and love deeper than the other person possibly could. This leads to half hearted friendships. Not to mention that some people are unable to handle the constant mood swings and stress it causes. This is the sad truth. We are different. And we are not normal in the eyes of society. But we are still beautiful. We are still useful. And we still deserve love. You will have only a few who can even try to comprehend. Only a few who can handle you at your worst and love you still. The pain of losing friends and not understanding is so painful. But I want you to know that even if you just have one person, thats something that some people don't even have. If she wants to cut ties let her. You deserve friends who won't drop you for a boy, or because they're 'too busy'",1
"Some people though they seem like forever friends really aren't. They are just those ones who sadly pass through our lives. I am horrible at keeping in contact with long distance friends most of the time because I rarely reach out on my own. But if someone messages or I manage to call someone, we talk for ages. Life gets hectic but if she won't contact you back then she's not worth it, you already did the easy part. I understand the fear of abandonment. I have severe abandonment and sometimes it's hard to really understand that very few people are an actual constant in your life. I rely on animals and my immediate family for consistency",1
Easier said then done but it's alot less struggle to just let it go then to try and carry the torch which may never be relit. Try to get a solid network of friends and maybe at times ponder what could've been but trying to live in that past is a dangerous blanket so familiar yet so cold. Moving forward is what life is experiences moments and those who stayed til the end. So keep your head up and stop blaming yourself as if your the one who caused the separation and try to look at it for what it is two people grown apart and no amount of tape can change what it is,1
"Your not alone, my friends have moved away even really really good friends and I barely hear from them. You sound a bit like me fear abandonment. I have my blended family (which offers enough stress) and work and pretty much no friends. I'm tired of being the one trying to maintain contact, it's sad but don't really have friends the last couple I lost were not real friends in the end.",1
Cindy Muhlenburg Border it was a struggle to get off the seroquel but once the doctor got things changed for me I really sleep much better. Plus I stopped drinking soda and eating junk food. Talk to your doctor that's the best thing to do - good luck!,1
I'm scared to try new meds,1
"I should add that I have chronic pain from degenitive disc disease.  I have titanium in c4-c7.  I have  chronic migraine as well as due to a seizure, no left collarbone. So exercise is hard for me. That's why I'm doing water therapy. 
It's so hard for me to stay active as it really gives me anxiety to be around people.",1
I have Bipolar 2 and take Effexor and Wellbutrin in am and 600 mg (neurontin) gabapentin + .5 mg clonazepam at night.  Has not been a problem at all.  I have an anxiety disorder as well. Never was on Seroquel or remeron but did take Saphris at night for a while which was great for sleep but did gain weight and had to quit because I couldn't afford it. Also still have left over weight gain from a trial of lithium that just made me too sluggish. Hope this helps.,1
"Very helpful. I took Wellbutrin for years but it caused me to have grand mal seizures. During 1, I broke my collarbone  and it  never healed and had to be removed.  I also have anxiety and take xanax as needed.",1
When it was just 20 pounds I accepted it. But now that it's 50+ lbs I think it's unacceptable. My primary Dr is upset. He says he gives remeron to his patients that need to gain weight. He also said I could become diabetic. So frustrated!,1
"I really got irritated yesterday when someone posted, in summation, that weight gain is a small price to pay for mental health. Ummmm NO!  If said weight gain worsens depression and anxiety then it IS NOT a small price to pay. We have enough problems without having to fight a battle against the scales.",1
"I am on 200 mg. of neurotin at bedtime for a total of 600 mg. per day.  Seroquel is the guilty party in weight gain.  I used to be on 300 mg. each eve. & gained as much weight as you.  No matter what I do, it is impossible to lose.  I have tried exercise and different diets (I don' t eat a lot) except this med. causes me to crave carbs at night.",1
No but Effexor made me gain a ton of weight and going off it sucks horribly,1
Shy Nielsen,1
I think your true statement was wasted on 95% of the readers.  I have watched the struggle of very responsible precious ones and am so proud of them and so blessed by them.,1
"Ok first of all, Marae Corday,  there is no snapping out of anything, no more than snapping out of schizophrenia. My husband suffers from this disorder and it can be devastating and no one with this disease chooses to be this way. Second of all just because someone has bipolar disorder doesn't mean they are stupid or incapable of being independent or self reliable. That all depends on the severity of their disease and their individual progress with treatment. There are actually a great deal of very intelligent and successful people, including celebrities who suffer from bipolar. Their is no doubt that someone with bipolar must have a strong network of family and friends to be supportive and help them when they need it but let me assure you that mental illness is in no way a first world problem as you like to call it. Mental illness stretches beyond all social classes, race, culture, religion, etc. I can assure you it is very much a global problem. The only difference between our ""first world"" and other ""third world"" countries is the attitude and acceptance of which we acknowledge and treat mental illness here. For example, most Americans have compassion and acceptance of mental illness without blaming the person who suffers while a smaller number of douchebags, such as yourself, have no understanding or sympathy of anyone else's pain except your own and just expect people to snap out of something they can not control. Let me tell you one thing right now, there has always been a disgusting stigma associated with mental illness that it is somehow bull shit, or can be prevented or avoided which is further perpetuated by people like you, but there is absolutely no difference between mental illness and any other physical diseases such as cancer or diabetes. It is a physical chemical/hormonal imbalance of the brain. Would you tell someone with cancer or diabetes to snap out of it? If you can't educate yourself on such matters and have an enlightened and intelligent point of view on such matters, then it would probably be more beneficial for you to refrain from commenting your idiocy because it reflects poorly on your character and makes you look like a horses ass.",1
Melissa Hobson I doubt you'd be bothered to read this but......,1
"Being bipolar, and having bipolar disorder is two different things. Everyone's case is different. There was a point I legitimately couldn't work for eight months. Trying to find the right mess, struggling with bad side effects, or having bad episodes in the middle of work. I never got help from the government. But that's each persons decision to make. When I got better it wasn't just easy to get back into the swing of things. Because of my ""personality"" it's always hard keeping a job. People don't appeal to my personality. No I couldn't snap out of it to take care of myself. My family helped me. If I didn't have my family it could've gone a lot worse. And not everyone has a support system.",1
Marae Corday the system is overwhelmed because it is chronically and terribly under-resourced. Has been for a long time. Your self-stigma and community stigma of mental health is part of the problem. We need to be part of the solution - Wake up!,1
"I'll try
I said MOST, yes some are so affected by this that they can't function, and they become homeless, but what is the solution? We have any overwhelmed ss system .
I was diagnosed bipolar
I work because I have a family and myself to take care of, but I feel overwhelmed so much at work I often feel it would be better to be dead.",1
"Bipolar disorder is a spectrum mood disorder. There's type I, II, and cyclothymic, which is a less severe classification between I and II.

With type I, the cycles are longer and you experience more episodes of mania. Type II (which is what I have) you experience what's called hypomania, a less severe form of type type I's mania. You may be irritable, snappy, productive, and goal oriented, but with a short temper. The cycles for type II are shorter and more frequent.

Cyclothymia is when you have frequent cycles between being ""low"", but not suicidally depressed, and hypomanic. You operate closer to baseline but you have frequent episodes between depression and hypomania.

Type II, however, is where you have cycles between hypomania and extreme suicidal depression. Type I can be difficult and dangerous because of the impulsive and reckless behavior associated with mania, but type II sends you into frequent states of suicidal ideation. 

The good news, however, is that both are manageable with medication and a good psychotherapist.",1
"I haven't been diagnosed with a stage yet, I am manic for longer periods than I am down, but drop fast and hard. I get suicidal ideation. I used to act on it when young, twice but was saved...luckily. I have learned to cope but it's a daily struggle.",1
"Type 2 can also be manic and depressive at the same time. That is when I honestly feel like I am going crazy and I truly need to watch my suicidal thoughts. 

If I had the study's link I would post it but for every manic episode in a type 1, there are around 4 depressive episodes. For type 2 that ratio becomes 1:40. Type 1 manic is also more in the ""normal"" range than a type 1's. 

Both types are horrible though. I don't wish them on anyone. Unfortunately my son has it too and is rapid cycling like I am.",1
"1 is not worse. They are both equally difficult in different ways.

With 1, the cycles are longer and you experience more episodes of mania. Type 2 (which is what I have) you experience what's called hypomania, a less severe form of type 1's mania. You may be irritable, snappy, productive, and goal oriented, but with a short temper. The cycles with type 2 are more frequent than type 1.

What is dangerous about type 2, however, is the extreme suicidal depression. Type 1 can be difficult and dangerous because of the impulsive and reckless behavior associated with mania, but type 2 sends you into frequent states of suicidal ideation. So no, type 2 is in no way less difficult than type 1.

The good news, however, is that both are manageable with medication and a good psychotherapist.",1
I try to enjoy each day. I embrace the high days but I dread the days that I begin to feel bad bc I know the first day of down is the best day and it's gonna get way worse before I start to level out,1
I'm troubled I have this friend 20 years since we first met and he doesn't know anything about my issues He is such a great friend it's like having another Brother At one point he came to visit so my niece has issues and she once told him how she suffers So I made mention one day of a situation she was in then said to him I feel so sorry for her family cause she's a constant embarrassment to them Then I said ur lucky u don't have any one u know who has Mental Illness He looked at me and said oh god no if I found out they did I couldn't cope with that So for that reason and even though he's a wonderful friend I didn't tell him and most likely never will sigh In my life I had two nervous breakdowns and he did come with my mum to visit me in the hospital But the way he reacted to my comments that day im not sure if telling him about my issues is the right thing for me to do   ,1
There is a gene for anxiety; namely SLC6A4,1
"It took me a long time to find the right combination of meds, but have finally found one that works, and have been on it for a few years now. And it does surprise you, and even scare you when things finally start to even out. I get the fear of the ""inevitable"" crash, but try to be positive, because that crash isn't guaranteed.",1
I've been told when I'm dealing with stress I have to try with some coping mechanism. It's easy for someone who has a normal brain but for us it's trying to tell a deaf person they should try to listen .,1
I hate taking meds. The flip flop of bipolar disorder is   horrible. I've gotten   better with handling it. But sometimes it still gets me,1
I must say I am controlled bipolar but I always have my ups and down still and yes I love the happy part but there's things that make you happy when your stable and not necessarily the mental part of it just try not to dread that you're going to come down eventually and be prepared for it,1
"Maybe your just starting to recognise some of your red flags as I like to call them. Subtle signs your mood is shifting. Id say use them as a positive....put bank cards in someone else's hands, dont buy alcohol avoid people and places your high will feed off. They wont always be signs of impeding change but if your not sure best to be safe. It's a good thing, your doing great. Getting to know your disorder that's all. Your maybe getting better and starting to notice more. Enjoy all the good days, yes the bad will be back but next time you will be ready.",1
"Im kinda the opposite i guess. I go along day to day and do my thing and its not all shine and rainbows but its not a.horrible hurricane either so im ok, i can deal. Then comes a bad day, usually triggered by my physical illnesses, and the bottom falls out. And everything is not just bad, but not gonna better. And then i start ti wonder if im just faking the 'happiness' and  good times. I wonder if im taking the saying 'fake it till you make it' to literal.... sigh",1
"Hi Fiona. Don't go off your meds until you explore other options. I can't tolerate side effects of Lithium (I can't walk because of ataxia) or any Antidepressents because I get an immediate manic swith. Also can't take any Antipsychotics because I get dystonia or akithesia. Took me 3 years to get my meds right ... and the weight is coming off. I understand your concerns as I put on 30 kgs.
So I have been changed to the epilepsy meds for mood stabilisation (Sodium Valproate and Lamictal). As well as an Anti Parkinson's drug (Simiplex). I used to have sleeping tabs (Zopiclone) and for spiking Anxiety ... Valium (prn). Now stable and in a very good place. No more sleepers or Vlium needed. I'm out and about walking ... lost 15 kilo's. Apparently Sodium Valproate and Lamictal are now first medications used for Bipolar in UK befor Lithium and Anti-depressant combo. I have Bipolar 1 (diagnosed 2012 ... Now 51 years old) and used to suffer long periods of manic psychosis. So hang in there and work with your Dr to find the right meds. I never thought I'd find the stability and peace I have nond All the best ...",1
"So just an update to those who want it :). I saw the doctor. She was so unhelpful it's not even funny. Said that I should have gone to my GP with the pain and other symptoms. After getting upset with her she admitted that I could be experiencing toxicity but refused to give me any tests. Said that I must stop the lithium and if I'm not better by Monday I must go to my GP and ask for tests. I demanded to be put back on my old mood stabilizer until I have seen my Neuro to get better help with my seizures. She insisted upon giving me an anti depressant which I have been told numerous times that I can't have. And told me I must come back in 3 weeks, unless the anti depressant makes me manic then I must come back sooner. I am grossly unhappy with the way things went down today. But I'm living in hope waiting to see my Neuro in hope that I can qualify for ECT or the surgery for epilepsy. Thanks to everyone for their support",1
First you're never beyond help second I've been on lithium for years and years and my first year of being on it was horrible. But it does get better and then you learn that your body needs it and you feel good about taking it and it really helps just make sure you get your blood checked every three months it will get better stick with it,1
I used to be on lithium . I was thirsty all the time and put on weight . When they got me on the right dose . I felt the wellest I have ever been . It was a shame I had to come off it as I had been diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic and was no longer allowed to take the lithium . I now take lamotrogine and I'm ok on it but not as good as I was on lithium,1
"I went from 800 mg to 1200 mg of lithium in addition to some other meds. I found that lithium destroyed my stomach and even made it to where I couldn't leave the house for a few hours following taking my meds out of fear of not having a bathroom.  I have since figured out that I have to eat when I take it. I found that it can't be a sugary snack, but like actual food. I also eliminated regular soda and that helped as well.  The big thing I have to watch for is getting dehydrated. I can feel how much different it affects me while on lithium and when I have an issue I reach for something like Pedialyte to help het a jump on balancing things out.",1
It made me completely nuts.   I had to go off after a few weeks because i was paranoid and seeing things.,1
Lithium made me a zombie when I took it.  But to let you know you are not beyond help.  There's other medications that help. Have you tried lamical?  It has calmed my nerves down more than my klonopin.  It is for mood swings but it helps for anxiety too.  Ask your doctor to give you a drug test that pinpoints what medication you can and cannot take.  That will help with what is out there.  It is only $20 and it will determine what you need . Don't ever let anyone tell you that you are beyond help.  There's a lot of good in you and it brings you down to here that.  Even if you have another Dr.  Don't get discouraged . Also trying therapy will help too.  It will make you feel more relieved to know an unbiased person can talk to you and bring your anxiety down.  I hope this helps.  Good luck.,1
"I had uncontrollable tics and tremors so bad with lithium I couldn't go out in public sometimes. I take Latuda now, it was a last resort for me as I have literally tried everything else. Good luck!",1
"I saw my therapist today...who works closely with my doctor. She said I look dreadful and was in tears from pain throughout most of our session. She has got the nurses to book me for a doctors visit on Friday to see what's up. The nurses agree that 5 days with increasingly worse stomach pains, cramps, nausea etc is not worth it. Something is definitely wrong. They are worried about my kidneys at this stage especially since I am already a high risk patient with decreased liver function. So it's just to wait it out till Friday morning. Thanks all for your support and help. This community is amazing",1
My sibling was on lithium and it severely damaged her kidneys and created other issues for her. Scary stuff.,1
"I'd be concerned that if you are high risk you are reactive to it in a different way than others are. Honestly, I'm obviously not a Dr., But since you just started the medication it's probably safer for you to stop taking it rather than staying on it until Friday.",1
everyday struggle,1
"It's not like I'm hiding my personality, but when you carry social phobia, borderline and others you don't really have any personality left. The illness becomes your personality. And people don't take kindly to unpleasantness.",1
im also bipolar wit depression & anxiety,1
Sacrificing your physical health fir your mental health is not an acceptable choice. Get with your doctor to search for meds for other options. No shame in asking about it. Weight gain and the impact on your health (physical and mental) are no joke.,1
"I was on Lithium 1600mgs/day. Over 15 years i too went from 130 to 204. I too was put on synthroid for hypothyroidism. I was also on a few other psych meds...seroquel, zoloft and 8mgs of xanax/day. I was a walking (fat) zombie. After years of research and a life changing event i finally took matters into my own hands. This was after years of self education. I stopped every med except xanax which i went to 3mgs instead of 8, switched from zoloft to effexor, and contiued taking the thyroid meds. Nearly 3 months later my weight dropped from 204 to 160. Now almost 2 years later i am 135lbs. My mind is so much clearer. My body is finally back to the way i remember it being. 
Big pharma will dose you your whole life if you don't take a stand! Being bipolar is hard enough but being overweight doubles the depression. I realized i needed to get better for ME!! I started talking walks which then led to hikes. Then i started swimming which led to learning to kayak which is now my favorite hobby. Stopping all of those meds was scary but in the end so worth it! Being sooo medicated made me basically lose out on being 30 something bc i honestly can't remember my 30s. I'm 41 now and i feel better all around now...mentally and physically. I also found God during my process which i feel like that in itself is the biggest trophy of my life. Without God i would not have been able to go off all those psych meds and keep what little sanity i had left. I thought Lithium was the best drug ever invented to control my moods. However now that i am not on a mood stabilizer my faith gets me through the rollar coasters. I don't suggest doing anything without intense education and research. I have found cannabis to be my natural stabilizer. I never thought I'd be able to live taking just 3 prescriptions...considering there were times in my life when i was on 14 different psych medications at once...who can keep up with so many? No wonder i don't remember my 30s..lol
I'm now 41 and my mental health and my physical health are better than ever! Also my sex drive came back after 12 years of thinking it was gone forever!! Yes I'm bipolar, ocd, sad, ptsd....those illnesses do not define who i am today...i am me! I will post 2 pictures and you will see the difference.",1
"Pls talk to doc before stopping meds. I was a size 8 when I was put on Seraquel, ... was taken off due to wait gain, struggled to loose it for months, & as the lbs slowly began to shed, I decided to stop my lithiun (900 mg daily). I ended up sectioning myself... I got out, went back on both previously mentioned meds. The weight came back, plus some. Made it up to over 200 lbs & had to sqeeze into size 22. Told my doc I felt the weight gain negated/out weighed the mental gains. Now I`m about 8 mo on just lithium & Ambien. I tried EVERYthing to slim down: veggies & water, sweat & tears, no processed sugar in the house (my teens l~o~v~e~d that one) accountablity partners. Nothing helped. I went through another anerexic stage (not sure of correct term but I wouldn`t reccomend it) Now I`m a snug size 12/14 & scared my stupid brain won`t know when to stop loosing weight...",1
"I was a very unhealthy 113 lbs when I started Lithium and I also had thyroid issues before realizing I was bipolar.  I am 131 now after having been on the lowest dose of lithium, but I feel human.  I eat better.  I am motivated to leave the house and be active (more so than I have been in years).  I worry about you just stopping.  If I were to do that, it would be hell for me.  I hope you find something that works.  ❤️",1
"With anxiety medications and antidepressants make you gain weight.  Now there is a solution for that.  If you get on thyroid meds to help that will work.  Also I know it's hard but change what you are eating.  Like put fruits and veggies in the house and if you crave something create something good with the fruits and veggies.  If you go off your medication you will experience hell . You will have ups and downs and you will eat BC you are depressed all the time.  You will have withdrawal symptoms and that is hard to stop.  You will make yourself worse stopping it.  I am bipolar and I really don't suggest to stop taking your meds.  There are some really bad side effects from it.  I would lower your dose on the lithium and stay on the other.  I don't want to sound rude but the last thing you should do is stop your medication.  I have seen what happens and I know you will not like it.  For example,  my dad is bipolar and my mom comes from work when I was a baby and she saw my crib broken into pieces with me still in the bed.  He was off his medications for several days.  Now when I ran out of my anxiety meds for 5 days my jaw locked up and all I could do is shake and cry BC I couldn't talk.  My jaw was pretty much stuck.  I have tmj and it flared so bad that we had to force my pharmacist to fill it.  There are not any methods you can do if you stop your medication.  I would just be careful.  And you may be on a high thinking it is ok to stop.  A lot of ppl feel that way.  You are not alone.  Stay safe and good luck!",1
"Imma big girl and my mood stabilizer is topamax, it helps.to curb your appetite.  You might want to talk to your doctor about it if your worried about weight. I understand   about the stress and depression of weight gain. I have a lot of medical problems as well. They play a big part in my weight, but to make a long story shirt, i once had lost alot of weight and was thin and have gain it all back plus alot. And now i cant get it off no matter what I do. But the topamax has helped with the not eating all the time which helps me  to atleast not gain more weight. I would highly recommend not going off all med completely tho. They arent miracle pills but they help out brains work the way they should. Things can get scary when not on meds, ive been there....  i hope whatever you do, you find some happiness and peace",1
If you hold onto anger it just eats away your insides. I never raise my voice at my wife so we have never had a fight in 20 years of marriage. If you don't yell back at someone they soon calm down. I also forgive my family and friends pretty much straight away after an argument cause it's no use holding onto the anger you feel. I just go on with life and the dark damage that fighting brings does not bother me at all of course I get upset but that's usually at the referees in the footy I love. lol I yell at them. Life's too short. Enjoy your family and friends while you have them cause one day you or they will be gone.,1
"So just an update to those who want it :). I saw the doctor. She was so unhelpful it's not even funny. Said that I should have gone to my GP with the pain and other symptoms. After getting upset with her she admitted that I could be experiencing toxicity but refused to give me any tests. Said that I must stop the lithium and if I'm not better by Monday I must go to my GP and ask for tests. I demanded to be put back on my old mood stabilizer until I have seen my Neuro to get better help with my seizures. She insisted upon giving me an anti depressant which I have been told numerous times that I can't have. And told me I must come back in 3 weeks, unless the anti depressant makes me manic then I must come back sooner. I am grossly unhappy with the way things went down today. But I'm living in hope waiting to see my Neuro in hope that I can qualify for ECT or the surgery for epilepsy. Thanks to everyone for their support",1
"Hi there, I only identify with drinking a ton of water because I'm constantly thirsty. It works well for me so I see that as a minor inconvenience (plus I should drink more water than I used to anyway) the only big problem I had on it was when I was over my current dose as dr prescribed (past 300mg in AM and 450 in pm) I was in such an unmotivated foggy state. My advice would be that don't worry if it helps but isn't at the standard ""therapeutic"" dose, even if your blood draw results come out that it's low and you've been steadily taking it and not missing doses. I'm at the dosage above and have been for some time after tapering down. It still helps immensely, so in my opinion don't be afraid to tell your doc to lower dose or even see if there is something else entirely, even if you've tried s ton of different meds. I know I didn't tough on all your concerns but I hope this helped a bit. I wish someone had told me sooner that the ""standard"" therapeutic dose is what most people are on, but some people are different and their dose that works for them CAN be different. Best of luck to you ❤️",1
"I was on lithium for 9 years. It worked amazingly but is a Terrible drug. It dehydrates you because it has high concentrations of sodium in it which first off do serious damage to your kidneys. Secondly it makes you drink A LOT. if you get even the slightest bit dehydrated on it, it turns all your body organs toxic to themselves and will cause organ failure of all your organs and you can die (same with if your lithium levels are even the slightest bit high which is why they have to do frequent bloodwork). That is why there are warnings to stay out of the sun at all times and drink a lot. Also, if you ever get pregnant on lithium it is known to cause severe deformities such as missing or duplicate body parts, non functional organs, and organs forming outside of the baby's body even. You can also never stop this med cold turkey or it will kill you. I missed 3 doses in a row once (2 mornings and a night doseTotal of 1,200mg) and by 3pm that day everything was spinning, my heart was racing, I felt nauseous as hell, and ended up fainting. The Drs confirmed it was due to withdrawal of the lithium. I would NEVER recommend this drug. It was the absolute most effective med I was EVER on but it's so scary.",1
"I saw my therapist today...who works closely with my doctor. She said I look dreadful and was in tears from pain throughout most of our session. She has got the nurses to book me for a doctors visit on Friday to see what's up. The nurses agree that 5 days with increasingly worse stomach pains, cramps, nausea etc is not worth it. Something is definitely wrong. They are worried about my kidneys at this stage especially since I am already a high risk patient with decreased liver function. So it's just to wait it out till Friday morning. Thanks all for your support and help. This community is amazing",1
"Let them see you at your worst, don't worry about how you look.  Unkempt is good. Let your anxiety show, if you feel like crying, cry. Presumably you will be seeing a mental health professional, so any diagnosis beyond anxiety and depression can only help your application. Good luck",1
"Wow, it's been 3 years and even had a metal plate in back, have DDD, Severe Depression, Chronic Anxiety Disorder and still was denied!",1
My issue is I haven't seen a shrink. I have panic disorder. And PTSD so bad I barely leave my house. As well my PCP doesn't seem to get that when I ask for a referral for a shrink I don't want to speak to a male shrink. They keep forcing me to go see male shrinks. I won't go. My trauma stems from a male. I have to get a referral from my PCP or my insurance won't pay for it. I haven't worked in over 2 years and my savings is running out.,1
"I've been fighting for 2 years and I'm now in the appeals process because a judge said I'm not disabled enough (bipolar 1, ptsd, anxiety, bpd, schizoaffective disorder) I can't even go grocery shopping at a decent time, but in supposed to find a job. And one that will let me take a 15 minute break every 2 hours.",1
"Wow!  That was fast. I was in a car accident that wasn't my fault and I have medical documentation listing all my issues, depression, PTSD, anxiety, panic disorder, etc, since 2011 and still am currently under treatment and have been fired from 2 jobs and laid off. But they denied me 3 or 4 times and I am currently waiting for a court date!!! I started applying last year for disability.",1
"That's basically how mine went. But I had physical disabilitys too.  
I'm not saying someone should make something up but if you are being treated for,high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic pain etc bring documents/doctors records for that too",1
"I also got approved very quickly.  I applied in March and had my first check in June of that year.  It helped that they had all my work records and medical records showing the years I spent up to 6 months in and out of the hospital.  When I went to their psychologist he talked to me for a bit and at the end of  the 45 minute visit he told me not to worry he was approving me.  

Yes, on average there is a bit of a fight to get approved.  But don't let fear of the fight stop you from going through the process.  You never know what the outcome will be.",1
"I have had a long struggle .
 I may look fine on outside

"They have to have one of their doctors verify and confirm the full extent of ur mental illness and to what degree everything appears ie:slight,mild,acute, average, moderate, duel purpose diagnosis, severe, extreme. When u go to eval be completely honest, no adlibs, no over/under  exaggerated, don't leave anything to their interpretation. Take meds as prescribed on day of eval, find some self moderation exercises that actually works,  use affirmations to alleviate anxious/fear, relax, be urself, don't think about things too much or too little, if u don't understand a question ask for clarification before answering, take ur time it's not good to rush this eval, say a prayer to ur higher power of u have one to help u stay calm cool and collected. Don't stress too much remember this is only one step to self reliance. Keep up the fight and u will succeed. #breakthestigmaofmentalillness",1
They turn every one down on your first attempt I got a lawyer the second time but I had documentation from when I was a preteen it's not easy but it's a huge relief when they validate how hard you struggle everyday,1
"I have and been denied twice now and my mom it took almost 6 years for her to get hers.  To qualify you have to see a Dr at least once a month and the Dr has to say that you unable to work for whatever reason.. Anxiety, ptsd whatever and that's the main thing because they will suggests different jobs that they think you'll be able to do like answering the phone or filing paperwork.  Stuff that seems easy or manageable for them.  So get a lawyer and make sure you have all your medical records especially anything staying you can't work.  Good luck.",1
"Yeah you have to see a psychiatrist at least once a month and when you're applying for things like this, it's better to get your psychiatrist to write you a letter to give as proof as they can describe it better?? Well for me that was easier as I struggle putting emotions into words. But it's hard to get taken seriously. They mainly consider those who also have major physical effects too. So like with me , I black out alot and become unresponsive. But even with that information I have still been rejected.",1
You can get one of those pay after you win lawyers so you don't have to go to court all the time.  I get super anxious about stuff like this too but keep pushing forward.  Any little bit of progress is still progress.,1
Do you know if it is required to see the psychiatrist or psycologist once a month? I see my psychiatrist once every 12 weeks for med checks (because of my insurance) but I see my therapist once to twice a month depending on the time of year and some times as often as weekly (I was denied once and got anxious about seeing a judge so I am about to apply again),1
"And job  that they say that you can do .disqualify s you. If you have one ,Don't worry. You still have another one.aee not disabled!",1
"Olanzapine is the best drug to be on is you have either bipolar or schizophrenia. My diagnosis is changed from time to time. I am definitely bipolar but at times the features of the illness change where there are paranoid themes, delusions and random voices. This is called schizoaffective and it is possible to swing between both spheres. I'm from Australia and initially olanzapine was only prescribed for schitzo disorders. When I was put on olanzapine I have been the best I have ever been  most of the time, only problem  is an issue is weight gain and severe munchies.If you had full blown schizophrenia you would not be able to hold down a job, you would be crippled by the voices and psychoses and not be able to function well in society. Go with it. Bipolar can be great when its not out of control for motivation. creativity, artistic persuits and holding down a job and doing it well. The self harm thing has never been an issue with me. But there are therapies that you can use to stop that destructive behaviour. I'm told its a distraction from the pain that you may be going through. I wish you all the best.",1
"My moods are leveled out, but it's definitely not a ""quick fix"" or ""happy pills"" I still struggle a lot.",1
I get some of my worst panic attacks right before I fall asleep,1
Except the night terrors...,1

I've felt this and been woken by panic attacks,1
"It really depends on who you have helping you. If you have recorded history of issues and a good knowledgeable case worker it will be much easier. I haven't gone on disability, they offered to send it through for me but I didn't want to. But, I used to work for a company that handled cases for people on unemployment, going through disability, working with vocational rehab consultants and it really is surprising what gets denied and what gets approved (that is why I stressed the case worker).",1
"I was granted SSDI surprisingly quickly. I filled out the paper work with a social worker provided by my mental health care clinic when I was getting treatment. I am diagnosed with anxiety, MDD, and BP 2.  Just keep in mind disability isn't ""free money"". It is barely enough to cover expenses and you'll still need other help with food, housing, and maybe even extra insurance to help with things not covered by medicare (which can be a lot). Not to mention they will routinely decide that you owe fees and will withhold some of your funds, this may become a larger problem with the way congress is going and can vary by state regulations.",1
"I have bipolar disorder panic and anxiety disorders borderline personality disorder, paranoid personality disorder and a few more I can't remember off the top",1
"I did not use a lawyer I just went to my local as office had them help me fill them out and they asked me over 1000 questions , when they are talking to you don't be scared to answer honestly even if it's embarrassing or whatnot because then they will think you are just fine.",1
"I was denied initially, which is common unless you are mostly dead. I got a lawyer, and we have been working on it, he's handled everything, contacts my Dr's, sends them questioners and collects the information we need, I finally just got my hearing date in September (it's been like almost 2 years since I appealed). My Dr's are fully behind me, and my lawyer knows he doesn't get paid if I don't get get the disability, so many times if they feel there is no chance they won't take your case at all. I have a hard time talking about my mental issues, but he's told me that is not the day to to hide away and pretend it is all OK. Don't lie, don't overdue it, but be honest about your worst days, what it's truly like for you. You have 30-40 minutes of me and the judge asking you questions about your mental health, please don't tell us you're OK when you're not. There is also another person I guess that will be there that will be judging my answers and information and in his opinion am I able to work. He has never met me and is simply going by the hearing. My lawyer and the judge will question him too. Then it can be a while before I get my answer about the hearing as well. My psychiatrist told me she believes I'll get it, and she can't believe I am not on it already, she was very clear in her opinions. My therapist is being grilled and she is very clear about how detrimental it is for me to work. I've also got spine issues (4 spine surgeries in 2 years, chronic migraine syndrome, that actually landed me in the hospital for a week last month) so they are submitting those files too, and asking my neurologist for his input. There is no point asking my ortho surgeon, my lawyer says ortho surgeons are almost impossible to get to help with disability benefits. So it can be done, but it's a long, frustrating road. They usually will back date your payments to the original date you applied, if you get a lawyer, they will take a percentage of that, which is a small price to pay to not have to navigate through this alone, I've not heard many people win this on their own. I've got bi polar 1 rapid cycling with psychosis, ptsd, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder. Hope this helps answer some of your questions.",1
"Was approved about 10 years ago for Bi-polar II, anxiety, panic attacks, depression etc... (after being denied 2 years prior)

"I can only tell you about my experience but I also have diabetes and chronic pain from migraines. I have Major Depressive Disorder, PTSD, and anxiety.

I had help from a Legai Aid paralegal and she was incredibly helpful. I would not have been able to fill out all the paperwork without her. Both my physician and the psychologist I was seeing filled out paperwork to send in. It took months to hear anything. I was *incredibly* lucky in that I wasn't denied the first time and so I didn't need to reapply and/or see a judge. Most people, like 99%, have to file an appeal. I know of only one other person who did not have to get an appeal and she lost two inches in height from a compressed spine. I don't know but for me it might have been because I have both mental and physical issues.

Good luck.",1
"I couldn't share the original post from Vellum and Vinyl so I copied and pasted it:

""psa

no one fucking tells you this so here it is:

when signing out forms to apply for disability / filling out a form for diagnosis

you’re supposed to fill it out as you on your worst days

like, I filled out forms that said I could do most things usually

like, my doctor added in the conditions like “yeah, they can feed themselves when not stressed” “they can do this when not stressed”

but how I should have filled it out was more like

“some days I can’t feed myself” “some days I can’t leave the house”

My doctor didn’t even know this, but I talked to someone who had worked with people with both developmental and intellectual disabilities for a number of years, and she told me to write down how it is for your bad days

this should be a thing they tell you, but it isn’t

part of the reason I didn’t get my autism diagnosis as soon as I should have is because I filled out forms wrong!""",1

Finally able to have relief from anxiety and panic attacks and am finally getting out. Ive tried many antidepressants but do Not respond to them.

My mom is Bipolar (where I get it from) and she smokes pot and it REALLY helps her. Also, as Melissa Hutter has already mentioned, withdrawals from benzos are pretty horrible. I mean like diarrhea, vomiting, and flu like symptoms such as body aches and fever. That's the worst withdrawal though. Just talk to your doctor and the both of you can determine what is right for you. There are non-narcotic drugs that can relieve your anxiety as well.",1
"Beta blockers (only blocks the physical symptoms), low dose seroquel (you will be drowsy) or buspirone (has been shown to have similar efficacy to xanax but needs to be used over a number of weeks like an antidepressant but isnt a benzo) are all good choices; I'd only use Xanax  as an extreme emergency option and use it extremely rarely (as in I'd keep some around and only use it when all else fails - make sure you have as many other options both medical and psychological available as well).
A combination of meds may also be needed.
To address my anxiety, flashbacks and extremely minor panic attacks I use mindfulness practice, deep breathing, propranolol (20-40mg twice a day), effexor (150mg in the morning), Epilim (400mg twice a day), mirtazapine (7.5mg at night) and as my emergency medication for when everything else fails valium (2.5-5mg up to twice a day as needed).
Seroquel is also used but I use that for sleep not anxiety 25-100mg at night as needed as is my prescription.",1
"I take Xanax and honestly it's very helpful for me. I don't do well with the energies of many people so whenever I an forced to go shopping I take .5mg and sometimes take another if the anxiety is intense. I'm prescribed 3 max per day.

You can use dissolvable klonipin can be used only as needed for panic attacks in the moment. Works wonders and you're not taking it all the time. Only when needed. It works almost instantly when used.,1
Just don't let them talk you into taking a benzo such as Xanax or klonopin. I've been on klonopin for ten years and the withdraw is horrible plus it should only be short term use and now my memory isn't so great thanks to being on it a long time. No one told me the effects of long term use.,1
^that's what I take. My psychiatrist took me off klonopin because of how bad the side effects are and what new research about it has shown. I'm also in counseling to help with the anxiety (among other things.),1

Another is a multi mineral supplement (trace minerals 2 witjout iron ir copper) and added magnesium. Anxiety and panic can be caused by zinc and magnesium deficiency alone. Sometimes niacin helps me with rumination and compulsions.",1
"Norine Delong Jarrell it does work. Getting back in touch with your senses individually and focusing on these can be a good distraction from a panic attack. What has always helped me is just remembering this too shall pass. It's all in my head, deep breaths , slowly in and then out.. and it goes away eventually    taking the deep breaths and slowing down your heart rate truly helps though   ",1
Have you tried meditation? Relaxing music. Stress ball? Coloring mandala's? Thats what I do when I get panic attacks,1
"My best advice after being on meds for 10 years.  Be totally up front with your psychiatrist, don't stop taking your meds without your docs approval.  You may have to try several or combination of 2 or 3 drugs.  It takes at least 3 weeks to start working.  I have an addiction problem so can't take benzodiazepines, Xanax, Valium, klonipen, Ativan etc. usually used for anxiety. There are others non addicting.  I can't drink alcohol.  You should consider that as well. Just don't give up and the group is great. I've gotten good advice and support. Good luck and welcome to this thing called life in our world!",1
I feel for you. It's not an easy road. Have you been given meds??  I've found out I had bipolar 10 years ago. I have been on a multitude of meds till the right combination was found. Therapy also helped a lot. I have actually been very stable but can't handle stress very well.,1
Hi Debra I have issues to the one thing that really upsets me is people not understanding They call me lazy keep saying how is it you go to bed so early every night saying you feel so tired when you hardly do any physical activity I tried to explain that a person can become so mentally drained stressed and other things that it wears them out physically and that's why we get so tired but they still don't understand Vikki Tempest,1
"Jennifer Wilson It wasn't exactly pointless for me. I walked out with my soul more intact than it was when I went in. But apparently it was stressor related, not medication.",1
"Jennifer, my son was on Abilify and insisted it was not helping. After a discussion with his psychiatrist, he was taken off Abilify all together and put on Depekote. He was also put on Lexapro(sp?) for his depression and xanax for the anxiety. Talk to your dr. It's seems to be all trial and error. My son was diagnosed in February and has had several med changes already. This combination seems to be working...fingers crossed. Good Luck to you sweetie...God bless",1
"Oh my goodness I was changed on to fluoxetine and victran I think thats how they were spelt, I had the worst nightmares, dreadful sleep at night, I would be up 10 times a night putting washing on, hanging it to dry and going to the loo,  I then drove to a place 40minutes from home and nodded off a couple of times ar pt the wheel.  I had to pull over ten minutes from my destination for a power nap to just get me there.  I felt like crap and thought my end was due.  However. Y Doc agreed straight away to give me back my stresam and venlafaxine. Okay so I am back to 7 pills a day rather than 2.5 but I am happy again.  I guess each drug works differently for each person.",1
"Great question! With today's social lifestyles it's not unusual to have a drink or two with dinner or catching up with friends. I have been on Prozac for 3 years and enjoy different wines especially with meals.

 Drinking every night is not advised as i found even one wine with dinner would make me feel drunk then the next day i would feel irritated and depressed. My doctor knows i like a drink every now and then and said its fine in moderation so possibly special occasions or once a week 1 or 2 drinks. This medication is there to do a job that your body can't do on its own so if you drink constantly your reversing its benefits, then its really not going to work for you. If you enjoy a social drink i would advise to continue that, but drinking everyday is certainly not going to help you with the treatment of whatever reason that yoy are on prozac.",1
I take the exact same mg and the first time I drank with it it definitely caused me to have a panic attack. Drinking while taking fluoxetine can cause your nervous system to intensify. I still drink once every other weekend but I only have a drink or two and it basically feels doubled. I get tipsy a lot faster since I take this medicine. I've definitely cut back on my alcohol intake.,1
"Are you using for bipolar?  Or anxiety?  
I gave up drinking and it's been the best choice I stopped having any day after blues.",1
I wouldn't risk it! Some antidepressants magnify the effects of alcohol. So even one drink can feel like a lot more.,1
"When I was on it,  I would drink cautiously if I was out to dinner. The biggest caution I got was about drinking and taking Xanax for my panic attacks. It is not recommended to drink while on SSRIs, but you should be asking your pharmacist or your primary care if you are worried about side effects.",1
I have drank on paxil and celexa. Did ok with a couple beers. More than that or liquor gave me anxiety,1
I don't risk any bad effects by being sober!,1
Alcohol brings on major anxiety for me too.,1
My next days after drinking tend to be my worst. My anxiety is SO HIGH.,1
"All I can imagine 4 martinis would put me over the edge, I used to drink heavily, until diagnosed bipolar, I used drinking to try to sleep. When I started meds I stopped because my meds help me sleep. I tried drinking on the 4th , I would rather not, feel horrible, SO thankful not dependant on it anymore.",1
"Go to a psychologist and talk about it. You probably do, you would know. I was diagnosed 8 years ago and everybody has to walk a different path but I would avoid the anti-depressants. They're not effective in treating PTSD and that's all they got. Avoid any anti -anxiety drugs, they're all highly addictive and stop working after awhile. Research Cannabis it helps with concentration and losing interest. Some strains can exacerbate symptoms so don't rely on past experience and don't go out and get a joint from a friend. That's what I've learned in those 8 years. Trying to save you some pain. Talking to a psychologist and using their techniques helps and that's it. Finding one that's not an idiot is another story...lol.",1
I wrote a letter to myself a while ago that anytime that I didn't feel good I read it in the letter it states the good things about myself and gives me some inspiration I pull out that letter when I'm feeling down when I'm feeling angry when I'm feeling anxious try writing yourself a letter it really helped me. Oh when you're done with the letter put it back so that you can read it again next time,1
"Find a hobby that you love that your girlfriend isn't really into, so that when she is not around you have something to look forward to doing.
I used to have this issue when my husband and I first started dating... And I still experience it sometimes... But I started using our time apart to take some online courses and read some books... Now I don't worry about him not always being around :)",1
"1st on list . You feel like u can't breathe, she isn't dead! Inhale again, yup still does ur head in . So ur anxiety is totally real, as u smile and pretend. GET a hot water bottle turn ur saddest music on and validate yourself coz you matter . Give yourself permission to feel that shit, coz its the secret to your healing !!",1
I know it sounds lame but I have a teddy and full body pillow that I can cuddle during the night. It really helps me with my separation anxiety.,1
"They say to count things, i get mad anxiety but not over the same things. 
Depending on where you live, seek private advice.",1
"Talk to a therapist about your abandonment issues and separation anxiety.  It's not easy feeling that way,  and maybe you can find some hobbies you like as well.  Painting,  drawing,  video games,  biking,  hiking,  coloring,  anything really.  It truly helps when you work hard at staying busy.",1
"Have you thought maybe a relationship isn't working right now? I know it sounds shitty, but maybe you should work on yourself before you have to forget about yourself and worry about making your significant other happy?  Its hard working on yourself and keeping a relationship happy.",1
"I'm going through same situation
Only my partner knows about my condition n he. Allstate me crazy , nut case, physco , told me to go get perfessional help for my issues.
People don't understand people like us who wake up n struggle with our day of functioning n it. 
My partner is sick but I don't call him names or wxnt to run away from his issues kiddney failure, dialysis. He is just as more bipolar n moody than me . 
Some people choose to not except this illness or understand or stray around long enough to cope n help others they choose to hurt u more with name calling n putting u down more so u feel even more worthless n useless.
I deal n struggle every day to hold inside n bite my tounge a lot. It's coming to an end though n he will be gone out of my life..
I can't have neg people n my life it's already a struggle.
I'm always there helping him through his illness n doctors but, can't be there for me??
He wants to leave n run away from a. Racy ass bitch well there's the door buddy  go!
No advice to give ..
Wake up with a fake smile pretend it's all ok smile n wave !",1
"Be honest with him. He can be a big help once he knows the problem. Believe me, he has already noticed your swings and anxiety. He needs to understand why.  Also, hugs and kisses are a fantastic medicine for you when he understands. This came from my doc decades ago. God helps tremendously, also.",1
I would say be honest with your boyfriend. Explain that you are uncomfortable with the diagnosis and thats why you have not told him. I had similar difficulties with a female in the early years of my diagnosis. She eventually found out from someone else and ended the realationship because i had not been honest. If he loves you he will stay around. Half the battle with a mental health diagnosis is accepting there is a diagnosis. I know how difficult that can be; however it can be a huge relief and you will feel much better just by accepting that there is no shame that there is something wrong and you are not the only one as others have and do suffer the same and similar. I have schizo affective disorder. I hope all goes well for you,1
Never be scared to tell them. I told my boyfriend before we even started dating that I have severe anxiety disorder and depression.,1
Why in the world would you keep that from him this long? He will probably be relieved knowing you have a reason for your actions. Imagine what he thinks now? It might help you to have someone that can help you realize when you're cycling. My husband is a huge help letting my doctor know when I'm struggling. Most of the time we don't realize or remember how bad we've gotten. Time to put on your big girl panties and tell him. Also get a new doctor there is no such thing as borderline bi-polar kinda like being borderline pregnant!,1
Hunny u have to just do it he's either gonna take it well or he's not.... U ate who you are and you should not be ashamed of that... I have bpd anxiety panic attacks and mood swings.... Its life.... Just be honest,1
"You shouldnt have to keep such a 'secret' if your bf truly loves you he will stand by you know matter what. Although it may take some time to get through, and he may also be upset for not sharing your mental health issues with him sooner, you just need to rip that bandaid off. My partner and I are high school sweethearts, he suffers from depression and has anger issues cause of it, and I suffer from depression and anxiety. We can never seem to help ourselves in our time of need, but we always stand by each other in those times of need. Moral of my story, tell your partner if he loves you, he'll stick by you. My partner and i suffered from mental health long before we met and now we conquer it together..",1
Mine knows all about my bipolar. Should never feel ashamed of who you are..be honest with yourself so you can then be honest to your partner  I'm sure he will understand,1
"Just be honest with him lovely :) Explain why you've been so worried about telling him before. Good luck, be brave and go for it xx",1
"I had a date last Friday and told the guy I was bipolar and depression I know I would have anxiety and was sweating and embarrassed but he told he had a sex addiction and he is a councillor and thought I be in good hands..but the sexual advances were awful and didn't know how to react very uncomfortable and he told me might have a Heart attack.I was so upset..
So said goodbye but didn't feel good about myself at all...so saying all that..it made no difference
So confusing and I haven't been sleeping for weeks..the next day I couldn't get out of bed and was crying all day...he rang me and I couldn't talk to him ..is this normal to feel like this...so confusing and I wonder what I could had done differently...",1
"First of all, I'd be seeing a new doctor, there is no such thing as ""Borderline Bipolar"" as a diagnosis. You either Have Bipolar 1 or 2 or you have Borderline Personality Disorder. 
Second, please be honest with your boyfriend. If you have been with him for 2 years, you shouldn't be keeping that from him- although, I am sure he has been through your highs and lows and might have an idea. 
Be prepared though for him to possibly be upset that you haven't been upfront with him.",1
"Just be honest. My husband has bipolar & paranoid schizophrenia, as well as ADHD... i also suffer from severe anxiety... we have always been 100% honest and upfront... its a big key to building a solid foundation in a relationship... if they truly love you, they will be 100% supportive...",1
"I'm manic depressive and have anxiety. There's days where I'm petrified to leave the house. Because I just don't want to have to talk too or deal with people.I told my boyfriend now my husband,  when we started dating. If they care about you it won't matter. Just be you. If there not OK with it. Then there no worthy of you.",1
"Be. Honest. If he truly loves you,  and you truly love him, do it. You have to. I have seen my girlfriend's anxiety at a pretty bad state. And I stay, because I love her. But she told me early on.",1
"Im sorry hun, you may not want to hear this..... but im not sure you truly love him, or your dont think he truly loves you. Maybe both. If its been this long and you havent  talked about it.... I have bipolar depression, anxiety, social anxiety, abandonment issues, and a truck load of physical.health problems. So i kno those conversations dont come easy. But they usually, always in my case, come in the begining of a relationship. And i kno i want and need my bf of over 2yrs to be there for me when im having an 'issue'. He is my rock! Like i said hun, this all may be hard to hear and def not what you want to hear but i tell it like i see it. And if at the 2 yr mark you still havent opened up about who.you really are..... is this really an honest, good and real relationship? Best of luck  sweetie",1
"Tell him, it's something he needs to know, if he doesn't already, but it's an awesome feeling when ya got somebody to help you through your meltdowns, providing they can handle your mood swings, but after 2 years I'm sure he has some idea... I told my current partner before we actually got together, after coming out of a bad relationship with a guy who made me feel soo guilty for my thoughts n cutting n meltdowns....",1
"I was terrified of telling my boyfriend but I did and expected the worst however he laughed and said well I had already guessed with the way your moods are so I hadn't done a very good job of hiding it after all, needless to say he now reads up on how to cope with a bi polar girlfriend and he loves telling me new things he learns from the reading up on it, just tell him I'm sure your anxiety will decrease substantially as well once your open and honest, I know mine did, x",1
"Woaw. I could've never kept that. Hell I warned my husband,  in part so he knew exactly what he was getting himself into lol but yes after two years he's obviously seen it all anyway. Just tell him! At this point,  the hardest part might be that he could be upset you didn't tell him earlier   ",1
"After two years, I'm certain he has went through your mood swings and anxiety with you. He may already know and respectfully does not bring it up. 
  Communication, honesty and trust are the keys to building and maintaining such a relationship",1
"You should be honest love, keeping secrets only causes you  stress ,and if they truly love you they will stay with you x",1
"I highly suggest coming clean about it since you have kept it a secret for so long. Just calmly bring it up and tell him that you are very sorry and were scared to tell him,if he truly loves you,he will talk it out with you",1
I have all but a few of these.  People really don't understand our struggle is much more than just mood swings.,1
"Photographic memory is completely gone. I've never felt so dumb in my life. I also have many of those physical ailments. More meds on top of bipolar meds. Currently adding high blood pressure to the list, more doctors more meds.",1
No doubt she probably the same,1
Visteral  is a wonderful drug...it helps with my anxiety and with my sleeping,1
"i have info on natural healing both spiritualy and holistic to reverse the symptoms and ilness itself and get u off medications and living a happy and successful life!  PTSD Bipolar, anxiety, depression and all other diseases!!!",1
Vistaril is a joke.. it's just glorified Benadryl.. I tried it and it did absolutely nothing for my depression or anxiety,1
I take vistaril for my anxiety it works good for me plus i have my depression medicine too,1
"Not a dr but vistoril is not as strong or long acting in my opinion. Maybe an SSRI would be better. Klonopin and vistoril does not treat depression and SSRI'S, like zoloft, prozac, lexapro and more work very well w anxiety and depression.",1
"Everyone's different hey each is own if they prefer meds r not I personally ....prefer marijuana it works for me in bipolar the one were 1min im happy then 51/51/50.
...next up be sad  anxiaty ....for month r 2 sometimes3 then out of nowere il get up in the morning happy as kan be mind racing like mtf wanting to do sooo nanny things kuzz I did it go out my house for DOES months .....then that's when anxiety kicks in KUZZ in trying to do n go EVERYWERE at ones ....plusses They also diagnose with  different personally mood swings something like that....at times I can even deal with my own self i never know how il be when I wake up in the mornings.....as long as I have my weed I'm good but I don't get to have it all the time dont always have the $$ for it I just refuse to take medication I have had very very bad experiences with meds.....",1
Vistaril didn't help me just gave me shaking fits,1
Vistaril is Antihistamine and non-habit-forming. So to me it's worth a try. In the past it helped some of my anxiety. But currently I'm on gabapentin which is doing a better job for me but that is a daily medication,1
I'm on it as needed only 25mgs. It seems to help on days when I feel really anxious. I can take it up to 3 times a day and if one 25mg doesn't work I can take another adding up to 50mg and it seems to do the trick.,1
Vistaril works for me as an occasional as needed anxiety medication.,1
Medication is likely going to be necessary. It's ok. Come to terms with that. You will probably feel so much better and managing your illness will be far less stressful. ;),1
I only use vistaril at night to help me sleep if I'm restless. Knocks me out literally within minutes. No way I can take it during the day for that reason.,1
"I've suffered from depression since I was 14 and recently the last couple of years I'm having a lot of anxiety but I've never been put on meds for either I've just learnt to deal with it I guess and have learnt how to pull my self out of it 
Now I'm 25 this year and I think I may need some help as my mood swings are getting to much I stress way to much or I feel down 

Do I have to go thru 5 different meds to find the one for me or are they gunna make me worse is what's always turned me off :(",1
Vistaril worked enough to where I could work myself the rest of the way out of my panic attack.,1
My daughter (18) takes vistiril when she is having an anxiety attack.  It calms her down but makes her extremely sleepy.,1
That makes my anxiety SKY ROCKET.,1
Vistaril is my go to for anxiety. The klonopin is also in my blood.,1
"In my personal opinion.... if your anxiety is mild enough that taking a Benadryl would calm you down, then it's perfect for you.",1
I am going to get some sensitive plant seeds and start growing them.....when i used the leaflets in my tea and water i drank throughout the day.....my ex told me he saw a huge difference in me.......iam gonna do this ao i can get off medication cos it is soooooo not working for me either.......sensitive plant is also known as tickle me plant or shy plant or sensitive weed........whits man has classifies it as a noxious weed but as we know most 'weeds' have medicinal properties! !!!!!!,1
I take it and it didn't work at all. They took my kolonopen and replaced it with vistaril. I was in hospital last week with major panic anxiety aytack,1
Vistaril is a joke. It does nothing for anxiety. It's an allergy med.,1
"Works great for mine, but everyone is different.. and yes it is an antihistamine, but antihistamines treat more than just allergies. They also help with nausea, insomnia and anxiety as well. I like that I don't have to take it, if I'm having a good day and I also like that if I start feeling anxious I can take it and it works fairly quickly. My anxiety is pretty well controlled without meds most of the time but this med saves me when it gets bad.",1
"Unfortunately for me nothing worked for my super anxiety, as I call it. I was prescribed Valium 5mg 3 times daily and Seroquel at least at night and when needed during the day. No driving during the day though when on Seroquel. After years of trying, this works for me.",1
When it comes down to it no one likes medication. I have decided to go off antidepressants and have reduced my dose by half in the last couple of months. Goal is not to be on them at all. Too many side effects including loss of libido and osteoporosis. I know that antidepressants are a quick fix but after crying for a week and feeling a sense of helplessness I got my sorry arse into gear and started exercising and noted an improvement immediately following my first session. I'm looking forward to getting off the antidepressants for good. I have bipolar and I would rather be blue than taking too many medicines as well as not having to pay for another script. As my shrink has told me if you remove the stressors from your life that is causing your anxiety and depression consider not adding them to your regime. Less meds the better I believe. I also do mental health nursing and have come to realise that the cocktail of medicines that people are on is nothing less than outrageous and these people are not feeling better at all. Exercise. Force yourself its worth it and I am sure you will agree that it lifts your mood even after one session. Good luck.,1
"Visteril is actually an allergy  medication they also use for sleep and anxiety. I have constant difficult anxiety and visteril does absolutely nothing for me. I know meds work different with each person. This is just my experience. The only thing that has worked for me is a combination of a mood stabilizer, anti depressant and dissolable klonipin. I love the dissolable klonipin. When I'm starting to have an anxiety attack or my anxiety is just high in general, I dissolve one of my klonipin in my mouth and it works almost instantly. Regular pill form does not work for me at all. It just takes too long and doesn't work the same. Good luck",1
I don't have severe depression or anxiety but am being treated for it. I'm on Celexa and take Xanax for night I can't sleep. I recently had to change doctors and they tried to switch me to Vistaril for the sleep issues but I had to go back because it made me a zombie the next day.,1
"Yep that sounds like me!  I started abusing Xanax so no benzodiazepines for me. I take Prozac and Wellbutrin for depression, tegretol for mood stabilizer and buspar for anxiety.  If I can't sleep I take amytripolene sp.",1
"Everybody's different in what medication works for them, especially psychiatric medications. I had to go through several before I finally found the right mixture. Pristiq, lexapro, klonipin and trileptal. Klonipin is the least important on the list because, really, it only helps during the times my anxiety starts getting out of control, like before I go to work. 
I find klonipin works like a band-aid that easily comes off because the effect is temporary. Having an anti-depressant or mood stabilizer really helps prevent the anxiety from coming back as often and not be so horrible. I hated medications too, but I found out that they definitely help me function much easier and keep a job n such. 
But again, everyone's different. I hope you find some peace. ✌",1
"You're absolutely welcome. I just started a new great job myself and I was terrified the first couple of weeks, lol. I'm still terrified everyday I go... Plus I'm about to go back to school again for the Fall semester, which adds to the stress.
But my medications help get me through. 
I hope you find the right medicine for you. I know just doing that is such a stressful and tiring process. One of the medicines I took on my journey to finding the right ones made me produce breast milk, and I was 15 at the time... 
But remember you are resilient. I don't know who you are, but I can already say you are strong, because you fight the monsters too along with trying to live your life. You will make it through to the other side...stronger.   ",1
Seriously correct. Ty so much. I'm about to start a new job. A great job and I'm terrified . I just want something to work. Then I read the could be side affects and I don't take it   ,1
Made me have the shakes. Like they said it's a beefed up benadryl.  Makes me wired and tired.,1
Klonopin can create anxiety as it wears off. I'd be more concerned about the Klonopin than the new drug.,1
"I took it for my panic disorder, along with Prozac. I took it at night since it's basically a strong benadryl. It helped me. Make sure you adjust the dosage to what works for you because if you don't sleep it off, it will make you groggy.",1
Ugh see I tried celexa for 2 months  then after a month once it kicked in good it made me extremely unhealthy depressed like horrible but the month was great. I finally stopped taking it when I realized why. But I'm super happy y'all found something that helps. It's so hard   ,1
Celexa worked well for both my daughter's depression and mood disorders. Didn't help me at all. BuSpar seems to be helping. I only have been diagnosed with anxiety though,1
Celixia never worked for me its one of the first meds they put me on but i have severe panic attacks doc calls it high functioning axiety along with bipolar and complex ptsd with ocd and insomnia,1
I took it back when my anxiety was way worse. It helped but made me really sleepy.,1
"If you want to conquer the anxiety of life, live in the moment, live in the breath.",1
"I will admit, though, that breathing exercises did help when I was having an anxiety attack in jail, and of course they didn't care so I didn't get any treatment. I had no other way of getting any relief.",1
If I lived in the moment my anxiety would be worse but thanks for the unhelpful and insensitive advice.,1
"I've tried breathing exercise, yoga,my anxiety and depression only gets worse day to day",1
Vistiril is basically an antihistamine that works on anxiety. It's an amped benedryl. It worked when I took it until I built a tolerance.,1
My anxiety would make me cry for no reason at all. Even if I had a reason it made it worse and uncontollable and I'd end up in a major panick attack. Might not be on the right meds or need an additional med to what you are already taking. Had to increase my Prozac to 60 mg and Ativan 1mg 1/2-1 tab as needed.,1
"I can relate... my co-workers had to pick up my work as i sat in the fitting room (i worked retail) and cried... I was demoted and eventually fired...i haven't had a  job since because i panic to quick... i'm sorry i can't offer and help, but you aren't alone...",1
"This is your bodies natural response to being under stress and its not a bad thing at all. You may find it an annoyance,  yes, but there is nothing wrong at all. In fact you can learn to use this to your benefit. 
    Dont throw pills or labels at it. Embrace it. 
    Animals like ourselves have flood of brain chemicals to help with our flight or fight mechanism. Study it more and learn ways to control it or munipulate it.",1
I have this problem as well. I am also bipolar too. But it sounds like you are starting to get panic attacks which is often done by crying. I would seek out a Dr for anxiety meds to help control the anxiety you have. Crying is normal. Most women do it when they get stressed out. But if the crying gets worse either go with medication or a counselor. It will help stop the crying.,1
Someone once told me that anxiety is energy trapped in you. You have to find your healthy release (s). Hope this helps.,1
"I have always struggled with this problem. I've been accused of ""wearing my heart on my sleeve"", or being too emotional,  or taking things to personal. I've even lost jobs over it. No one understands what it is like to have all these things rolling around in your head that you can't control (bipolar 1, anxiety, bpd, ptsd). It may not be the best solution but what I always do was I would pinch my leg or back until I could get to somewhere private and then I would cry by my self. Just enough to deal til I could get through the day and then cry all the way home.",1
Dang.  Anxiety? Panic?  Can u go to the bathroom and sit quiet and focus on you breathing & just calm dowm?,1
"I can definitely relate, I cry not because sad/upset but when I'm so frustrated then I get angry because I'm crying. I have learnt (at work where it can get bitchy) to walk away otherwise I go off big time and become very nasty. Some don't like me walking away but it's a strategy I use.",1
"Crying is our body's way to release stress. So cry if you need to. Don't get angry when you do that. Crying is just like pooping. Do you get angry if you poop? No, right? Because your body needs it. Just think of it that way. And if you're uncomfortable doing it in front of other people, do it at night in your room or cr BEFORE you get overwhelmed by your emotions. Or just have a routine of doing it every night. Just like an exercise.",1
"yes it help but can medication help a bit ? 
and witch one for stress ?",1
"This is a problem that I have as well , I am bi polar but the meds don't seem to help this, I think because it's stress related...I've had bosses who questioned my maturity because of it, deep breaths don't work for me, seperation does but sometimes this isn't possible. ..I'm sorry if this isn't helping , just know that someone else can totally relate!",1
"I wish I had advice. I have just been diagnosed bp2 and have the same thing happen. My last boss would make me feel so bad about myself I ended up quitting before I had a new job lined up and life has been hell. Same experience though. I would get worked up and get emotional/ mostly cry and he would judge me and make me feel less than a person and incompetent like I couldn't do my job. I hated working every day. And now I'm not sure if it's my meds not working or if I'm just so over stressed making 1/3 of my previous wage and being uncertain daily of how I'm eating/paying bills/ putting gas in my car to get to work, that I end up crying at work every day still (luckily not in front of a boss or customers). I can't take it much more. Hang in there. Hopefully someone can give us something helpful!   ",1
"I have ptsd and I find if I get stressed my emotions get out of control and my pain levels increase dramatically.... I'm taking meds to helps stabilize the dramatic mood swings but also try to find other ways to release the stress as well. Deep breathing with my eyes closed, walking away from the stress even if it's for a few minutes, having someone you can vent to etc especially at work really helps.",1

"i have suffered for many years and now i suffer deep depression, i used to go to bed late and get up late, changed my meds and now get up early. my 21yr old son is depressed, he used to have a go at me for staying in bed till late and now he is doing it. when i try to get him out and talk to him about his life he throws my depression back in my face. he won't seek help and hates that i take meds, last time i changed to these meds i did really well but had panic attacks a few nights running so went back to my old ones. this time they are not helping, i know it's because of my son, feeling useless cause i can't help him.

"Everyone on here is giving you excellent advice. NEVER go off any med cold turkey. I went through hell and back with a horrible Psychiatrist who set me back by many years, my first suicide attempt, my second attempt and now med changes. My current Doc is wonderful. She agreed to ween me off Effexor and she is doing it in a way  that it will be months before I am fully off of it. So far I can deal with it because I know it is going to be there. 

Please be careful",1
The withdrawals are horrible and you should never have been in that tip begin with! Honestly talk to another doctor for advice about going off of it.,1
"Every cell and every organ of your body depend on serotonin.  Your body supply will have to regulate and you can not expect this to happen overnight.  How long have you been on Paxil?  I think the very best advice is to work with your physician to taper it down very gradually.  Make sure you are hydrated really well, and eat a good diet.  Some of the symptoms can be very difficult to cope with.  When I went off it abruptly it sounded like a freight train or a car going by every time I turned my head.  Evidently very tiny structures in your brain have to equalize and it takes time.  Look up sites that advise about tapering off medications because those are written realistically by people who know what it is really like.  There are pharmacists who can compound the paxil to a gradually lower and lower dose.  It can take months.  I recently went down on my dose of Effexor and Depakote.  I would say to be really good about stress during this time.  Prepare yourself for rough relationships really well......like seeing an X.  There are long term impacts from these medications that medical science is finding out.  A pill enters our entire body.  We want to be as cognizant of the side effects as possible.  Prescribers will not ask you if you have them!  They won't even usually do the right tests.  The physicians and the psychiatrist draw a line in concrete concerning what is each of their jobs.  Weaning takes time so there is not a rapid return of depression and anxiety and you don't get the withdrawal symptoms.",1
"Brooke L. Morgan my advice would be to keep a daily journal of mood, sleep, irritability , and anxiety symptoms.",1
"Electro-shock sensations running down their arms? That's nervous system, and not something to mess around with. Even if they are weaning, this is not something to take lightly. But I've never heard of ANYONE having withdrawals this severe when weaning. It has nothing to do with pain tolerance at all.",1

"Xanthrid Kalos It was awful! I thought the casting was dreadful, that sooooo didn't look like Larten Crepsley! Darren & Steve were awful too! I asked Darren Shan at the last book signing & tour he did in Edinburgh (back there 27th aug to see him) what he thought of it & he said ""It might not have been the way he had envisioned it turning out, however it brought him a whole new bands of fans. Because older fans were totally trashing it (quite rightly so) & saying the books were soooo much better (which they were) and that encouraged people who hadn't read one of his books to read them"" I think if the were ever to do that or Demonata or Saga of Larten Crepsley it would need to be like a netflix mini series if you know what I mean?

"Of course it was scripted.... It is a work of fiction!
The way it was shot was original at that time, and seeing in the theater was a great experience, because it amped up the tension as it went along, and you could really feel what the characters were feeling.
The actor's were given a basic script, dropped off in a forest, and left to improvise a lot, and capture their real reactions because they didn't really know what to expect, and I thought that really helped the overall feel of the movie.

"*the truth I'm about to share with you could hurt your feelings. Just a heads  up, but the truth hurts"" Coming from someone who just called off my engagement and 5 year long relationship, that type of shit does not change. If he cheated on you, and seems like he doesn't care about putting in the effort to understand the struggles you have with your mental health then he doesn't care. I'm brutal with the truth and if you have to question whether they care that means they don't because if a man loves you, you know he loves you without a shadow of a doubt. Men are usually an ""eye on the prize"" type. So if he doesn't care, you will know it by how he makes you feel. I'm sorry you are going through this.",1
"Also, your man is supposed to be your protector. He is supposed to keep you safe from harm. Not put you in harm's way by physically abusing you. You don't hit the woman that you love. That is not love my dear. Don't let him ruin your outlook on love and relationships because that is no measure or example of love or of what a man is. Keep your head up and even though you don't know me, I'm here if you need to vent to someone. I have found that sometimes venting to somebody you don't even know is really stress relieving.",1
I was in that situation before and it took me over a year to get out of it. It was tricky because we also worked in the same place until he forced me to quit. I constantly was worried he was cheating because he had in the past and things got really bad in the end. I eventually just left him in the middle of the night. The first few weeks were really hard but after that things did get some better. You can do this! If you need someone to talk/vent to I'm here! ~lost and forgotten,1
My advice? Get out of the relationship asap. Get friends/relatives/police involved in order to remove your things without feeling threatened.,1
"I hve ptsd, severe depression n n high functioning anxiety along with a few mre. My hubby doesnt talk much abt my illnesses but he does support me any way he can.

Hang in there,  life is possible even for us with mental illnesses. Jst takes a lil patience n understanding from ppl we love. But please get urself away from that kind of abuse it will only make ur symptoms worse till u cant handle it anymre.",1
I know this is going to be hard... But you need to leave... HE IS ABUSIVE.... He doesn't need to be physical to abuse you... He is controlling you mentally by not allowing you to work  through your problems and making then seem like a burden.. which they are not.. . Please for your safety get out of that relationship... Then you can work on getting your mental under control.... I was almost the exact same boat(I could only like read half cuhz my PTSD from my ex) and he liked to sleep deprive me to the point I would hurt myself to try and get some sleep.. and then he would accuse me of doing it for attention.... But as soon as I left him alot if my problems ceased greatly... At least to the point were I knew if got help I'd be able to get better .. and I did.. and it's been almost 2 years since I got away... And I'm doing so much better.... Two years from now I would love to hear about your progress ... But my fear is if you continue this path with that man in two years I may be reading your obituary....,1
Get out while u can.. next time ur alone pack all of ur stuff and run this person will only get worse he's playing on ur anxiety and thinks ull never leave a year ago I got out of a relationship just like that one and I'm so much better off,1
Please leave make a list of what you need to do and follow It one step at a time toxic PEOPLE around you need to be gone from your Life without guilt and then eventually you start to feel better and positive people will find you so you can start taking Care of you YOU are important and it's harder for  you to move on but it will be awesome to have breathing room you have to take care of yourself,1
"Please leave. What seems important to you now is nowhere near as important as your life. He will never understand your ptsd, anxiety or depression. He will be violent again and it will get worse. He will use your issues against you. He will blame his behaviors on your symptoms. He will make you feel like you are nothing. Please, don't let him have that power over you. I have lost 3 homes, 4 teeth, suffered broken bones and bruises, been choked, nearly lost my life, been abandonded, neglected and used. In all that pain and confusion you are feeling right now dig deep and find enough love for yourself to save yourself. I have been homeless for over a year. It sucks to no end. But i am still alive and moving forward. Had i stayed i am confident i would not be here right now hoping with all my heart you leave before forced to endure what i have already survived. I don't know your man at all. I recognize every detail you gave as i have already lived it. Free yourself! You will be so glad you did.",1
Look for another job in a way that won't let him find out that where there is no conflict. Once you get one get out of there. Being in a toxic relationship or with someone that cheats or is abusive can give you PTSD itself. I have been cheated on and I understand the anxiety aspect of that. It takes over your every thought. I'm so sorry you have to go through this. I am just getting out of a toxic relationship and leaving was one of the hardest things I've ever done.,1

Do you know what it is about it exactly that causes your anxiety? Or is it just the fact that it's happening?,1
"I mostly have fear from nighttime/dark sky ones (due to a Thunderstorm childhood trauma)  where I live sometimes it don't get that dark during them. I find closing windows, if you have somebody living with you ask them to. Close the curtains and if it's dark turn on lights, it'll help reduce your seeing the flashes of lightning. Headphones or a stereo, play your favourite music songs and if you have the option to use the fade into songs use that so there's no stop between songs. If possible stay in a area/room where there is no windows. 

The most effective thing I found though was facing the fear, looking out the window during it. I can't go out during a Thunderstorm and I cry if I catch myself outside during an unexpected one. But for the most part watching it has helped me get over some of the fear, maybe watch thunderstorm videos first before watching one from your window. Also use lightning apps it tracks how close the lightning is to you so should prepare you more, keep an eye on the weather forecast. Keeping prepared in case of one helps. 

I am on depressants and medication for my anxiety but I don't take anything for thunderstorms (and I only started my medication recently and we haven't had one since I started my medication so my advice should work for you medicine free.) 

Also if your fear or anxiety causes adrenaline use it i found the energy from that helps a lot keeping me alert and makes me look forward to the Thunderstorm rather than fear it.

I know that's a lot of information and I hope it makes sense and I hope it works.",1
I think I have always been afraid of them and I talked to my doctor and thats when he put me on medication for anxiety,1
"Try speaking to somebody as well then during it, a friend or somebody you live with. Distracting yourself might work. Or go to your doctor as they should be able to get you in contact with a physiatrist to help you get over the fear. 

Is it something you've had since a child or is it from a trauma like mine?",1
I have really bad anxiety and I used to hate thunderstorms they would scare me so much. One day I was waiting outside for my parents to pick me up from school and a storm came out of nowhere and I was so scared because I couldn't go inside and it was so loud so I rang my mum upset and panicky and they made sure they got to me as quickly as possible. But no matter how scared I was in that moment I haven't been scared of them since because I had to face it without a choice! Maybe next time there's a thunderstorm you can tell yourself that it's going to be ok and face it! You could also imagine it's just some crazy person on the drums xD but I hope you get over this soon! Stay strong!,1

"Suicide isn't selfish - it's a last desperate act by a human who is suffering so much agony they think that dying is the best solution .... why do we as society try to put blame on or label something like this instead of asking HOW or WHY they ended up thinking that way? 
Selfish is ignoring someone who is suffering that much. Selfish is labeling them as crazy or selfish or needing to just get over it. Selfish is pushing aside questions that need to be asked for the quick and easy answer of ""they where just selfish and thought only of themselves"". 
Don't blame yourself for someone else's decision to end their life. Don't blame them for making that decision either. What's the point? Will assigning blame bring them back? Will being able to label it really make things better? No. It won't - in fact it will probably only serve to make you feel worse.

Being on medication is not a bad thing.. this is how I look at it, I have to take medication to give me control of some sort that gets me through my day and helps me. That's the only person it is ever about!!!! You!!! You can not make anyone happy until you can make you happy! If you have to use medication to give you that but if control, that's fine, and if you can learn to do it without medication, that's fine too. Find what makes you happy.. don't wish what others say or think because, although I don't know your story and that's fine, people who will criticize you or tell you thats not what tou need, I can almost guarantee you they don't understand, comprehend, or have the slightest idea of what you go through everyday. Nor could they even begin to understand a portion of what goes on each and every day. Hang in there.. you are a survivor!!!! Good luck and best wishes!!! I hope that I have helped even just a little and I hope you stick it out there and keep pushing and hopefully you will see there is truth to what I am telling you! Speak positive on yourself! You have purpose and so many things to live for!! You are young and overwhelmed and tired...  but your life is really just getting started... a career, a soul mate, kids, neices and nephews, if you have siblings, but most importantly you make it through! You learn control as it goes on, I'm not saying it's easy because it's not but you have  to reach down deep inside yourself and find that fighter... that fighter that's going to gain control and stability and someone who is enjoying life instead of being miserable in it! Find the good things... the things that are important to you! Because that's where the healing process starts is with YOU!!!! Good luck! Hopefully I see and update from you shortly! You can do this! Just believe in your heart that its possibly to get better and feel better! I embrace my mental illnesses because I have done research to learn what I can about them and I am just trying to live my life one day at a time accomplishing something I struggle with to prove to myself I have more control today than I did yesterday!!! I used to be so embarassed for anyone to know that I suffer with bipolar disorder or anxiety or depression or PTSD. But this is my life and my life depends on me! My lidenis what I make of it! ThUs what I am saying to you! It is what you make it! You can overcome this if you want to, you can gain control and live a great and prosperous life! It's all on what you want from life. Don't overwhelm yourself though... take tiny steps to help you reach your milestones! I am confident that you will make the right decision and at least try. You can gain control... you just have to want it. You have to want a better life and want a way to stop the suicidal ideations, the depression, the anxiety... it will happen!!! Just don't give up! Because as you get older you will look back on these times  and be grateful for the experiences you want through because of the person it makes you! I love what I have been through... it's not the easiest to talk about not does it make me feel the best but I am thankful for going through what I did because I learned so much and I am proud.of the person I am and the person I am becoming. I am a mother, aunt, sister, wife of a happy husband, daughter, granddaughter, friend. My family doesn't always understand me and that's ok because sometimes I don't understand myself and that's ok too. But don't let little things like that bring you down. Keeep on fighting! Keep pushing! Don't expect every day to be the same... accept the fact you will still have your bad days but hopefully you gain the knowledge to accept the bad days, push through them and prepare for a better tomorrow!!!!",1
"I have the same problem only I hate family gatherings. I always feel they are watching me to see if I say the wrong thing. If I don't say anything they wonder if I am mad or sick. I have a lot physically wrong with me then you add bi polar. I also have chronic depression and anxiety. I worry about everything, I work myself up over things that turn out okay. I constantly am consumed by death, planning in my head my funeral, and everything. I guess I am wanting to make sure they get it right. I don't want to die, I would not take my life for my religious convictions, I just think about it. Maybe because of my health. Things I loved to do I cant. I still can read, and use my computer for two hours. Circulation in my legs. I am 64 and have been sidelined since I was 49.Another thing is all I do is talk to my sisters about what doctor I went to, and what they found, they don't want to think of those things they don't want to loose me. God Bless you dear, one day at a time and no matter what you are wonderful.",1
I'm not sure it works in the UK but I use CBD oil for anxiety. It has tons of heath benefits including anti anxiety but is also used commonly for children with epilepsy and other illnesses. It is extracted from cannabis but there's no THC content so no head high or anything,1
I take Ativan for my anxiety and it helps me to sleep and stay asleep.,1
I have the same issues. Not wanting to shower and my house is a mess. I want to shower and clean but I just can't. Today I slept most of the afternoon like I have for the last few days. I also have a 6 yr son. I was trying to explain to my bf about my illness bipolar stage 2 ocd panic attacks anxiety attacks possible ptsd and he was like I don't care I don't have to deal with it.,1
I understand your frustration. While my circumstances are different in many ways I'm similar. I can leave my house but I also want desperately to be a functional member of society. I want to work so badly. Unfortunately it can take time. Medication also isn't a quick fix. I have bipolar 2 and PTSD. My depression was very severe but it can and will get better. You just need to be patient. If you have been on this med a while it might be worth trying something else. It could also be an idea to ask your psychiatrist for a second opinion. Keep fighting. I assure you it will get better. *hugs*,1
"I had been on the same meds for 10-15 yrs so I told the dr. my anxiety was getting worse. I have so many med allergies or bad reactions I get scared to try other meds but I went through about 4 months a trying different meds ending up in these classes b/c nothing would work or I was allergic. I have been put back on the original med of Zoloft with with  sequel, the sequel has helped the panic but the depression is off the chain. The dr. said my fight/flight switch has been turned on and my brain don't let it turn off. My house here has so much mold growing and my husband won't fix it so I feel I am not keeping my youngest daughter safe and I need to get out of this house which means I feel this huge pressure to work and then I get my mind all worked up into a really bad state.",1
It's not bullshit! You can't make comments like that unless you've been in the situation... which I personally have! It doesn't say everyone with a mental illness has addiction it's saying they are at a much higher risk of addiction. Also addiction can be other things than substance abuse.... gambling addiction and food addictions are just some other examples...,1
"Never touched or tried alcohol , no drugs and no cigarettes so it's a choice to pick them up and start but yes I can turn into a disease but just cause I deal with anxiety and stuff I still deal with it without those things",1
Just written about this. This does not mean all people struggling with mental illness have addiction issues. The point to take from this is people who have substance addiction are usually struggling from their own mental illness. Most people addicted to substances are struggling with their own emotional battle and they should not be stigmatised for it.,1
"I can see where this is coming from. I was diagnosed with bipolar nearly 2 years ago after attempting suicide. My mechanism to cope has always been food, hence the size I am. I find it very very hard to not eat junk food (to some people that may be confusing) even tho I have attempted to loose weight, every single minute of my life I'm thinking about junk food. So totally agree when it says it comes hand in hand with addiction",1
This mentality is why I am not prescribed helpful meds for anxiety.,1
Relationships are hard. With my first marriage i had was emotionally abused. I thought I would die too. But I pushed past that and now I am remarried and happy. Having suicidal thoughts is normal. I have had depression anxiety bipolar you name it I have it. However each day I wake up it's another day I had fought my demons. You need to find what is best for you. Do not be ashamed of getting help. Life is hard dealing with mental illness and a lot of ppl cannot figure out how to overcome it. Just remember even though you suffer everyday you are fighting a battle that can be won. It does not define who you are with what you have. Life has a funny way of of showing that there is hope out there. You just have to see it. Good luck. I honor you for going for your dreams in the air force. Just remember even though you suffer everyday you will survive. It is not your time yet.,1
"You need to see another psychiatrist, get help fast. I also consulted with the mental health in my job - useless! I felt even more angry and helpless. Work related mental health are prejudiced and do not have your best interest. Take leave and get some rest. Avoid negative people and people who have no understanding or interest. I live in South Africa and am fortunate to have a wonderful psychiatrist  and to finally found the right combination of medication to work for me. I am a nurse. I will pray for you.",1
3years ago I was where you are feeling same feelings I couldn't even get out of bed my Mom had home care and her nurses were like family they gave me 24hours to make the decision to commit my self OR they were going to do it for me I spent 30days in the psych unit and I started at the beginning of what I thought was wrong and I was shown what was really wrong please don't give up some how you aren't finding the right person/dr whomever it took me 11years and I am learning how to live with me again one day at a time I have manic depressive and bipolar with social anxiety disorder. depression and bipolar ARE 2seperate things that need to be treated differently Not all jumbled together you are not alone,1
"I was diagnosed Bipolar one 10 years ago after having a psychotic episode out of the blue. I always had depression/anxiety and had many labels. Now I've been on 600mg of lithium for 10 years and after so many meds I'm on 150 Lamotragine, 150 Quitiapine. 15mg Diazepam and a sleeping tablet I'm no longer allowed to take anti depressants as it only took 9 years to find out they made me high leading to 8 hospital stays. Now I stay out of hospital but am very low and feel I'm not on the right meds but scared to change as I've put on too much weight already now I know it's sweets etc don't help but I was never as heavy than when I was put on meds. Every night I feel I'm taking poison and right now i have lots of stress and feel like crying a lot. Going to see GP soon to talk about my mental health. I'm not ashamed to admit to Bipolar etc. But the term mental freaks me out. I'm convinced I will never recover from this awful illness. Xx",1
"I went through the same thing. I was devastated because in MY head (no offense to anyone on this page or anywhere meant) it meant it was worse than previously thought, and I had found such comfort in being able to justify it as ""only type 2"" however when I am on a medication regime as well as therapy regime that works for me, along with healthy eating and exercise (as much as I can Bc I have Cerebral Palsy) it is easier to navigate let's say, not always deal with, but navigate. I have no doubt you'll be able to as well with the right tools. Ask for help, take care of yourself the best you can, and be honest with doctors. (That last one used to be hard for me Bc I was so scared of my symptoms). Much luck to you ❤️",1
"If you need medication to help you feel better, there is no shame to that. In fact, does it really matter which diagnosis you have? By that I mean, it is so important for us to know what is going on and why but then we come up with a game plan. When my biological mother was alive there was not as much advancement as there is now in mental illness, in defining it and in treating it. You are not alone. I know how difficult that can be and how lonely we can feel. I do know that once I started to understand what was happening to me and why it helped. Because I now knew it was not a failing of mine, it was my brain. There is no shame in that. Can the medication help? If so, it seems like it may be worth a shot. I recommend writing down a list of what your concerns are. Talk it out with your psychiatrist. Take your time and go through all your fears and concerns so that you can find a medication that may help. Then start at a low dose and work your way up. Listen, there are so many people who share your diagnosis. Mental illness is no different from any other illness. In the sense that it is an illness. If you can treat it, please do so. In the best way for you. I am sorry you are going through this and I wish you the best. Please remember that you are not alone.",1
"I have bipolar one and anxiety!  I take my meds, deal with the hard days and carry on. I deal with it. We have a mental disorder. We are NOT the disorder !",1
every antidepressant they've ever put me on spun me into a horrible manic rapid cycling hell,1
"I have the same - bipolar and pretty bad generalized anxiety disorder. I have no idea about a free DBT app, but having mint and dark chocolate m&m's with me to eat can help bring me out/keep me from an anxiety attack.",1
Al the electronic means of controlling you're anxiety but I have found a way that would help immediately... mind you I'm bpd social and generalized anxiety ptsd and finally voices in my head. Anyway I've learned to find 5 things in a room and describe the details maybe there's something that you can realistically touch or just 5 colors and the details I have severe anger problems and this method has really helped.,1
"About, I wanna say 14 years ago. I didn't have a cell phone, or a computer. That's around the time everywhere I went whatever, whoever it was. Anxiety was running my life so I decided that very casually, I would plan out what I called ""ecape routes"" get to know the area, where doors, bathrooms and all that. Seating was important so I would go quietly if I had to. At Disney world I went into some big auditorium  show thing, don't remember what it was. Got my escape route planned. I'm seated. Then employees started closing thing and more security showed. I get a little panicked. Soon they announce its a surprise taping of ""Who Wants To Be A million are!"" So of course, for security reasons and all, no one was allowed in or out. I realized at that moment I had to figure something. I was panicking at the thought of panic..I looked at my kids who were having a blast. The contestant ended up using the lifeline, ""Ask The Audience"" soon I gained focus..long story sorry.. My advice would be have a back up of some kind, maybe even to.  I've always had a back up since that day. Sometimes I bring something in my pocket. I like the apps. Now one of my backups.",1
I bought a fidget box. It works for my friend. I've had to stop going to conferences due to anxiety but it works for my friend.,1
"There is the 4/7/8 yoga breathing that is also taught by a leading doc. You can look it up on the internet. 

I also found several relaxing sound apps that are free in the App store. That might help. 

See if you can write down any memes on cards or put them on your phone that can remind you to breathe 

Do you have worry beads? They are easy to make. Or maybe a calming cloth. I found the softest baby yarn and crochet a small square that I will rub on my face or in my hands. 

Or a new one is try to ground yourself. And go through your senses. What do you see? What do you hear? What do you smell? What do you feel? Do you feel your feet on the ground? Can you feel yourself breathing? 

I'm sure there are more that others will or have added",1
"Worry beads are beads you string together. My sister put some together for me that she picked out at the craft store. They were all of various shapes but harmonious in color. I could hold them in my hand and run my fingers over and over them. It really helped! I have a couple now. 

I use flexible string that will not break easily. I then choose beads that the color catches my eye and the touch feels right in my hand. Making a bracelet is easy to start with. When you think it is long enough, tie it off and seal it with clear nail polish. 

Let me know if you try this or have any questions",1
What are worry beads? I have really bad anxiety,1
"I have both and I am also going to three day convention in August. I wonder if we are going to the same one! I always take notes at these coventions. It helps me stay focused. If I am every feeling stressed I get out of my seat to walk around a little, eat a snack, drink some water. Sucking on peppermints help too",1
Michelle Armstrong I was only able to go to one day of the convention last year and struggled the whole time. I've spent hours with my therapist trying to prepare for the convention this year. I'm just trying to get as many tools in my toolbox as possible so that I can make it to all three days this year.,1
I have a fidget spinner app on my ipad (but it has an iphone version). It has really helped when I'm anxious. Watching it spin and change (and you can customize your spinner) is so soothing and helps me disconnect a little from my surroundings. It helps me center myself and work on my breathing. And it's pretty interactive so I don't get bored instantly.,1
"This is all I've got. I had to go to a 3 day convention put on by my company. I was afraid of having a meltdown. So I pretended that I knew what I was doing and saying. As long as I stayed in the state of ""pretending"" to do my job, it worked. It separated me from my fear of imploding. I don't imagine it will help you but it's all I have.",1
"My therapist has me use Breathe2Relax, it's free. I also use Calm. It's a meditation app, I love it. It has breathing, but they have a 7 days of Calming Anxiety workshop. Maybe do it more quickly, they're short. It'll teach you exercises to calm anxiety. I love Calm, I use the paid version to get all the stuff, and use it to get to sleep every night. I have awful insomnia, even on Ambien and other meds. Good luck. You can do it. I also have BPD (2) and anxiety.",1
"My daughter always makes sure she knows where she can go to decompress--there are often side rooms or lounges that are not so overwhelming.  There are several apps for deep breathing.  There is something on Facebook for breathing.  I haven't uploaded it because I have one, but if you check the App Store on your phone, I'm sure you can find something.  I know on iTunes you can find some great music if you put ear buds in you can listen and no one else will hear it.  My daughter has done that, too when she has to be in big meetings.  Stuff with rain helps her.  Good luck, it can be tough.  My daughter has bipolar and has panic attacks.",1
"Whenever I've had panic attacks previously, I used a reverse-psychology method where I tell myself I'm going to make it the worst one ever.  It inadvertently gives you control over it to some extent, and it subsides quicker.",1
I have suffered on and off with depression and anxiety for 30 years sometimes they're bad and sometimes they're tolerable just tell yourself it's only an anxiety attack and you're not having a heart attack and you will be fine do some deep breathing and think happy thoughts if you ever need to talk I'm here,1
"Toshay deep breaths and go to happy land forget whats around ya just worry about you in the moment think of the one thing that makes you smile everytime you think of it, chin up high scream in ya head iv got this and march on forward",1
"Very well said ... I have to deal with depression, anxiety and multiply split personality disorder & what u say there is bank on 100% ... Deep breaths n happy thoughts",1
"I deal with the same thing that your going through. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar disorder, PTSD, ADD, OCD, Major depression, Generalized Anxiety disorder (with social anxiety), agoraphobia, panic disorder, insomnia and bereavement. I am on Prozac, Abilify, Adderall,  Klonopin, Doxepin and Gabapentin. I still struggle with daily life issues and rarely leave the house. I stopped going around my friends and family. I am a single mother of two children (17 & 10) and I have to make myself get up , and act like I'm not stressed and struggling cause I don't want my kids seeing me this way. It took my psychiatrist awhile before she got my diagnosis and treatment working. Even though my meds work I still fight to feel normal. It's hard going through all this alone. Some of my family members turned their backs on me saying there's no such thing as mental illness's and said people who claim to have a mental illness are just looking for an easy ride through life. Easy sure is not what this is. I hope you get the help you need.",1
"I know for some ppl pot works and for me it seems like it doesn't.... But when I go a few hours without it.... Ohhhhhhh!!!!! Not good!!! I've also started getting twisted thoughts (more so than usual lolz) and am getting extreme paranoia.... I've smoked weed mostly more often than not for 16 yrs. There are side effects..... Also u can't be continuously stoned. Driving, work, in general. U need a day or so here n there to snap put of the dazed feeling. But u can't coz u with crave of start losing the plot.... For some ppl it works tho.... Just want u to know there's a dark side lolz",1
"When I was 25 I tried to kill myself and checked myself into the hospital.  Found out I had Bipolar 2 and had my meds changed.  I am almost exactly like this.  I take an ADD med, Anti-Anxiety, Sleeping, and a mood stabilizer.  Sounds like you could benefit well from some meds!  It doesn't get better without meds.  I had to stop my mood stabilizer to try to get pregnant and didn't realize how awful I was for the first couple years!!  haha  At this point my episodes could cost my family a lot of money and we don't need that!!",1
"Unbelievable that's exactly how I feel daily in my life! I ask, kneel pray to Jesus Christ for strengh guidance protection comfort healing relax. One day at a time sweet Jesus that's all I do. I Don't wish this ugly mental illness on anyone. Not even my worst enemy.. My Insomnia, barely sleep one, or three hours if I get a chance to sleep. Forever very dramatic drained, exhausted, fustrated, feeling horrible, mad, upset... I was diagnosed with bipolar anxiety depression since the age of 13 years. As the years accumulated my mental illnesses gets worse, and worse. I rarely socializing, can't be around hardly no human beings. The noise is so fustrating, Sirens music, Machinery operators..get very irritable! It's just not fair, but that's REALITY!!! So yes! All my love, respect, care, compassion, to everyone whom is dealing with this horrible mental illness... Let's please continue to communicating w each other and give one another our postive in puts... Stay strong to survive!!!",1
Cant stress enough go doctors get referal with expert advice take meds good luck it takes time but dont give up you are not alone,1
"OMG Melany Bass same here even though the highs have feelings of no pain, no fear like not a care in the world I still become destructive with my behavior and decisions.... For me though my lows although I work threw them are extremely low that's where the self harm comes in just to have some sort of relief or distraction",1
"I'm bipolar II, along w anxiety & panic disorder, well at least that my current diagnosis, they seem to have changed along the years, according to multiple Drs. But I want you to know you are not alone even though it feels like it most of the time. I have almost identical symptoms to yours.",1
"I have bipolar and am going through EXACTLY to a tee everything you have just said it's amazed me actually I felt like I wrote that I had to take a double take that it wasn't my profile !!! Your def bipolar and it's not uncommon to have ADHD or ocd and especially anxiety with bipolar . I'm on lithium , epival , lorazepam combo right now you need some sort of medication for sure for it just have to find the right one PM me if you want to chat we have so much in common regarding mental health it would be good to talk to someone like you .",1
No you need a psychiatrist and I highly doubt you have bipolar. If your moods change several times in one day it's borderline personality disorder. If they take a week or two to change between extreme high and extreme low it's bipolar. But how you explained it it is most certainly not bipolar. Which meds don't fix borderline personality disorder,1
I'm bi polar.i have those episodes.they call them being in manic state that can last for days.then u crash and the depression anxiety comes back and all u do is sleep.they have medication that can help.just have to find the right ones for you,1
Benedryl. I also keep on hand for anxiety attacks,1
"Bipolar! I have been bipolar and thanks to a great medical support team and the right treatment, medication and knowing what my trigger symptoms are I manage to cope 99% of the time. I have have a very stressful job in nursing and difficult homelife. I suffer verbal abuse from family and suspicion from colleagues. So what! Bipolar does define who I am.",1
I go through exactly the same it's horrible and even worse when you carnt even control your own behaviour or understand yourself and why nobody understands you 'that's where I'm at with it all 'iv no diognosis but have social worker how do I go about diognosis 'thanks everyone '  ,1
Sounds like bipolar hun.. speak to a psychiatrist they will beable to help you... I too have ADHD depression and anxiety... the latter comes with ADHD but can easily be controlled with the right meds and therapy if needed... I hope you come right and stuff,1
"There are lots of things that you CAN control in your life to help you not get that sped up high.  Like getting the same amount of sleep every night.  Like not drinking too much coffee ( sometimes one cup is too much!) and having a list of things to do to slow yourself down.  If I sense myself starting to mouth off I go in my room and I get more rest ( stops the acceleration.  I pray.  But everyone is different, and antidepressants cause mood swings into mania if we are prone to it.  I am beginning to think that there are a lot of people who might be better off not on long term antidepressants like they get left on them........because of all the side effects.  Taking another medication that has more serious side effects to cover the first medications side effects is not real smart.  I am sixty two and now find out I have damage to my liver and kidney's.  I also took naproxen and lots of tylenol the past eighteen years.  I did not realize the cost.  Also there is weight gain and that is depressing which makes a vicious cycle.  Take as little as you can of these meds, AND DO ALL YOU CAN to be healthy, on a regular schedule, not overworked, and discipline yourself before you get stupid.  -I found out that when I was tired, stressed, overworked, feeling alone, and desperate in trying to solve problems, THAT was when I was in danger of doing something stupid.  Live your life with care.  Sports and physical exercise that is SAFE and NOT EXCESSIVE can really help.  Some people can take less medication because they exercise on a REGULAR basis.  Some people get manic and abuse drugs or alcohol because they like the feeling and want to stay feeling on top of the world, but don't be tempted.  Any overdoing it in any area is dangerous.  BE EXTREMELY cautious in relationships ( especially getting into them) A good person is not in a rush to get into a relationship.  If you are your normal self, you will be careful and be safe!  Write out a plan for staying safe and balanced and not going off the deep end when you start to get sped up.  Notice the first signs of getting sped up.  For me it is not sleeping.  Have a few people to confide in what is really going on.  Keep a diary.  Keep a mood chart.  Spending can be dangerous.  Careful in all the areas that you might get carried away.  In depression you might not be good enough to yourself or seek a pick me up of spirits that will not last.  I read the Bible and I pray.  I like to read Psalms in the Bible.  It was written in a different time ( war time) and by a king who had many enemies so there are references to that........but It is awesome in prayers and praise to God.  Depression and illness are our enemies.  Psalms helps me trust in God, and get my feelings out to God.  Then the gospels remind me of who Jesus is and what He has done and will do for me if I have faith and ask!  Don't be alone and don't let pills be the only answer.  Some moods are normal.  Our enemies are the ones that take control and are hard to get loose from.  Be wise and ask God for wisdom.  Proverbs in the Bible says that there is success in having many advisors.  Counselors help you check in with how you are doing.  If you don't like one, get another one, but give one a chance a few sessions at least ( unless you can tell right away they are not for you) .",1
Jennifer Cutting the reason I say that shit is cuz in tired of people shit. I'm tired of everything trying hard and falling way below the dirt. I'm tire of trying to better myself it only makes things worse so I'm giving up and just going where the shit train take my miserable ass,1
"Brandy Rutherford, I have the same problem with weed. Use to smoke to avoid the meds. Makes me sick to my stomach every time. I still try every once in a while hoping to go back to it. I thought I was alone, I've never heard of any one else getting sick from it.",1
"Yes it does help in small amounts though, and only used when expiriencing high levels of anxiety or depression. It's not good to use it all the time because it will loose its effect after a while and actually do damage and can also create paranoia",1
Ask about geodon...it is somewhat new but helped me a lot...ive been on almost all bipolar meds...but stay away from benzodiazepines for anxiety...if you ever come off them...it is horrible,1
"Benzos actually didnt seem to help my anxiety much, and I was put on a regular and increasing dosage, which I questioned but doctor insisted it was fine. Gave me memory loss and made learning impossible. Didnt connect the dots until after semester ended and it was too late. I think I would have been alright had I only used it if I felt the point of no return for a panic attack coming. I will have to keep that geodon in mind if I need to readdress things... my current doctor only has me on adhd meds now, I know bipolar isnt out of the question as well",1
"Geodon is horrid. The withdrawal is worse ever experienced than any other drug or benzo...as well, causes heavy weight gain.",1
"I'd say there's no question you're on the bipolar spectrum. I'm bipolar I with mixed features. My episodes are a lot more intense than yours at times, but about the same a lot of the time. ADHD and Anxiety disorders are also highly comorbid. I'd see a psychiatrist as suggested by Miranda.",1
"I think you shouldn't have to pick between them, they are your parents. That said if they push you to choose, that can be hard. I know I have to constantly remind myself: my parents are human, have faults, make mistakes. I turn 25 tomorrow and I think teen/young adult you see more of reality (kinda like if you ever went to someone for homework help and one day after some years, your questions pass what they can help you with or you catch mistakes) that your parents arent the exact way you thought as a kid. Creates a lot of stress at that age alone. My mental health stuff was diagnosed in my 20's, my parents have little experience in this dept, and I have learned I cannot force people to learn, cant get them to try not to say or do things that can lead me to get fairly sick. I can learn ways to adapt to the environment I am given, so for that I honestly think a professional support system for you is first and foremost. I kind of blew off importance of psychotherapy, biofeedback, focusing on the physiatrist and meds. Not smart for my situation. I have done the opposite (off meds, thinking I could muscle through). And I have spun my wheels going nowhere frustrated for a long time thinking since I tried doctor or therapist A and B and it didn't work, so it must be me, this is as good as it gets don't bother looking for option C. Same concept with meds. But I think if you seek out a mental health care professional that you can trust and that is listening to you, they not only help you navigate other stuff but also help you in how to address the parent thing, how to navigate through those who do have impact on your health but whose actions you can't directly control. I think that is huge but often overlooked. Not only will you learn skills as tools for getting through those issues, but it will give you some solid ground to come back to and stand on through that therapist/doctor. If you are seeing someone now, be honest with yourself if you arent progressing: is it a simple fix on your end OR do you just not click? Shuffling around happens all the time",1
And didnt see specific phobia. So excuse me.,1
Well arent you sweet. Aint shit. Its a serious horrible thing to go threw. Ugh could say so much more because your response sickens me. But wont bother. Not worth my stress.,1
"That was named... ""specific phobia"" in anxiety... they don't have enough room to name everyone's shit...",1
What catagory does paranoia goes by?,1
And sometimes the cracks show so every one can see the pain in my leg was so bad I fell an hit my head never had problems with it before the doctor says it's my anxiety playing up and I'm feeling pain where there is none   ,1
"Unimaginable and invisible...I don't know if this can be counted as a mental illness or maybe the symptoms of depression and anxiety that I have, but I bought a new phone very expensive a 2 month worth of my salary...I loved the Cyan one I bought is it board and hard fried after 5 hours of use then I returned ans they told me there is no Cyan color on the market anymore you have to buy the black one! all the excitement that I had for the Cyan one when I was looking at it and the faint happiness that it gave me is now turned to anger, hate and disgust and even a mental pain when I am looking and holding the black one in my hand..I cry and cry when I have to use my phone it may seem ridiculous to everyone but the pain I feel is very real sadly and there is nothing I can do I want to accept and move on but this pain has already chained and nailed me down to the ground really hard...why it has to be this way? I always have wondered...",1
"Sometimes though, it gets overwhelming.  This weekend the world fell through.  Work stress mostly--I would love to call in sick tomorrow and extend a four day weekend into five just to spare myself the agony of dealing with the same issues I've been dealing with for months.  But, I can't.  I have to be the responsible one.  No matter how much it is going to rip me apart to show up tomorrow.",1
"First I would look for support groups in your area. They are free and can be quite helpful. Always make sure you follow up with your doctor and let them know what's going on too. There are also websites and chatrooms for people with mental illnesses where you can have a safe place to vent, open up, and seek support of others that actually can relate to your situation and struggles. Also it's helpful to have hobbies to distract bad thoughts and try to do the things you love as much as possible. You can do it! I wish you all the best :)",1
This has been me for too many years to count.. at least I now know about thyroid and adrenal issues that contibute to the endless anxiety...I feel for all of you who suffer also...,1
Right. People think I don't want to change or get a better paying job. It's my brain telling me I cant. If that makes any sense.  I want to so bad but scared of everything .  I'm not normal.,1
"oh yes ,i feel overwhelmed the minute i wake up,all these what if's and worries about the future start settling in and it takes me hours to pull myself out of it",1
Anxiety is a hell of a thing :(,1
"My job is extremely physically strenuous. People think as the day goes on that I'm just getting tired. I suppose I'm lucky that that's a logical excuse, but it's really because my anxiety escalates as the day goes on. Only a couple people at work know about my battle with depression, but only one who I really trusted to tell knows about the anxiety. It really is painful to hide it.",1
"Ian , you are so right, it is painful to hide it. I use to be a master at putting on the happy face, and hiding my anxiety, not so much anymore.This monster has a hold of me and it is truely scary. Give yourself credit that you can still hold a job, a strenuous one as well. I had to leave my job 5 years ago and have yet been able to return to work due to all this. Best wishes to you, and may peace shine down on you!",1
Only people who know me really well can see the little signs of my anxiety getting the better of me. My sister can hear the change in my voice. My husband sees how I stare at a wall when I'm trying to do something cuz I physically can't get my brain to focus on what I'm doing.,1
"So things may have taken an even worse turn.. I just had a mental break down just now and well, let's just say it was not a pretty sight.. I may have scared my family a little.. All I can say is it was well needed. Feeling that tiny bit better now. But feelings don't change that easily :).",1
"Marcus, I am very sorry you are dealing with this right now. Actually, I turn 25 today, and the past few years have been really hard for me. Sounds like youve been doing a lot of wheel spinning too. Frustrated, tired, discouraged that this is it for your options and they arent working.. I can't say I know your experience but I'm betting those components listed are there. At your doctor, I would tell them straight up what you said regarding the meds to us, that you are afraid to go back on that because it only made things worse. I applaud you for having the courage to speak to strangers on here, and also making that dr appointment. Courage, energy, and rational thinking- and you have all of those. You have much to miss in this world, stay around if you can. I know it is hard to see past the hell you are going through, I get it. So, in that case, wait until tomorrow when you can see past it again. Whether tomorrow is 24 hours from now, weeks, months. That tomorrow WILL come. Sometimes, you cant force yourself to be optimistic, but you can look forward to the day when you can. If anything, I'd say, try to wait that moment out. I think you have the strength and will, as you have been able to take some big steps in talking to us and making that appointment, there are those that struggle in taking those steps. Keep fighting, dont hesitate to talk to us on here",1
"F.E.A.R Has two meanings ;) you can live past 25. Since you say you don't actually want to give up. That means there is fight in you. Your depression, what it did, it took your wings, only forgetting you still have your claws       ❤ fight man! You're not weak. You just forgot how strong you are. When life knocks you down, calmly get up, smile and say ""you hit like a bitch"". I'd be lying if I said I never felt suicidal. I was diagnosed with PTSD, depression,chronic insomnia which would cause both visual and audible hallucinations, at 16. Then 3 years ago diagnosed with social anxiety and panic disorder. The meds I take for anxiety is lamotrigine.. actually fucking helped I couldn't believe it and for depression and insomnia I take Trazadone. For me these helped amazingly especially trazadone. I'm on the lowest dose and only need to take half at night to sleep and I've seen much improvement with my depression. But it's no cure so of course my episodes sneak their way back in. But I'm so happy I at least feel better to where I don't feel like I'm aching to die anymore because it's just so exhausting. I hope this helps a little and just know that I'll be thinking of how you're doing and I care, I really do. Wishing you the best. Take care",1
"When the person is miserable and there is no hope of recovery. This almost never applies to mental illness, although we may think so sometimes.",1
"I know it's hard, because suicide is different for everyone. I used to read this post whenever I felt like I wanted to end it. Everyone is different and I found that this helped me out as well as seeking professional help. I am one of seven and when I was going through my darkest days I always thought of my little brother, who would have been 6 at the time. I understand that for some people it is impossible to think of anything thing else but this what helped me. I also wrote a story for those closest to me, which explained what I was going through, which also helped me. 
So anyway, this is the post I read;
Wanna kill yourself? Trust me I've been there before... & I'm here for every single one of you!!

Imagine this. You come home from school one day. You’ve had yet another horrible day. You’re just ready to give up. So you go to your room, close the door, and take out that suicide note you’ve written and rewritten over and over and over You take out those razor blades, and cut for the very last time. You grab that bottle of pills and take them all. Laying down, holding the letter to your chest, you close your eyes for the very last time. A few hours later, your little brother knocks on your door to come tell you dinners ready. You don’t answer, so he walks in. All he sees is you laying on your bed, so he thinks you’re asleep. He tells your mom this. Your mom goes to your room to wake you up. She notices something is odd. She grabs the paper in your hand and reads it. Sobbing, she tries to wake you up. She’s screaming your name. Your brother, so confused, runs to go tell Dad that “Mommy is crying and sissy won’t wake up.” Your dad runs to your room. He looks at your mom, crying, holding the letter to her chest, sitting next to your lifeless body. It hits him, what’s going on, and he screams. He screams and throws something at the wall. And then, falling to his knees, he starts to cry. Your mom crawls over to him, and they sit there, holding each other, crying. The next day at school, there’s an announcement. The principal tells everyone about your suicide. It takes a few seconds for it to sink in, and once it does, everyone goes silent. Everyone blames themselves. Your teachers think they were too hard on you. Those mean popular girls, they think of all the things they’ve said to you. That boy that used to tease you and call you names, he can’t help but hate himself for never telling you how beautiful you really are. Your ex boyfriend, the one that you told everything to, that broke up with you.. He can’t handle it. He breaks down and starts crying, and runs out of the school. Your friends? They’re sobbing too, wondering how they could never see that anything was wrong, wishing they could have helped you before it was too late. And your best friend? She’s in shock. She can’t believe it. She knew what you were going through, but she never thought it would get that bad… Bad enough for you to end it. She can’t cry, she can’t feel anything. She stands up, walks out of the classroom, and just sinks to the floor. Shaking, screaming, but no tears coming out. It’s a few days later, at your funeral. The whole town came. Everyone knew you, that girl with the bright smile and bubbly personality. The one that was always there for them, the shoulder to cry on. Lots of people talk about all the good memories they had with you, there were a lot. Everyone’s crying, your little brother still doesn’t know you killed yourself, he’s too young. Your parents just said you died. It hurts him, a lot. You were his big sister, you were supposed to always be there for him. Your best friend, she stays strong through the entire service, but as soon as they start lowering your casket into the ground, she just loses it. She cries and cries and doesn’t stop for days. It’s two years later. Your teachers all quit their job. Those mean girls have eating disorders now. That boy that used to tease you cuts himself. Your ex boyfriend doesn’t know how to love anymore and just sleeps around with girls. Your friends all go into depression. Your best friend? She tried to kill herself. She didn’t succeed like you did, but she tried…your brother? He finally found out the truth about your death. He self harms, he cries at night, he does exactly what you did for years leading up to your suicide. Your parents? Their marriage fell apart. Your dad became a workaholic to distract himself from your death. Your mom got diagnosed with depression and just lays in bed all day. People care. You may not think so, but they do. Your choices don’t just effect you. They effect everyone. Don’t end your life, you have so much to live for. Things can’t get better if you give up. I’m here for absolutely anyone that needs to talk, no matter who you are. Even if we’ve NEVER talked before, I’m here for you. Copy and paste this as your status to show people there are people out there that care.let's see who actually read all of it.
For anyone that feels this way     
Could 1 friend, please copy and repost (not share)? We are trying to demonstrate that someone's always listening.

"How can you even win with answering this question, the people we leave behind are going to say we r selfish, but we know we are not and have validated that in our own mind. Trying to convince the people that are left behind that in fact we weren't being selfish is something they cannot understand. Mental Illness and the suffering that we go through is not any different than any other debilitating illness. If we have come to peace with those terms to end OUR suffering, remember it is OURS, than that is by our choice.  My children have watched a lifetime of a sick mother and a well mother and although if this was my choice to end my life, yes they would be sad but would completely understand and not for a minute say that I was being selfish.. Being raised with a mentally ill family member they have learned that ultimately this could happen. I could also have a heart attack too, would they be any less upset. No......",1
Suicide is never OK...... It's unfortunate that our minds get so desperate to relieve ourself from what ever it is where going threw that we are tricked into thinking this is the answer.....  Perhaps it's your answer but that doesn't make it ok..... There's nothing OK with a life being taken even if it's your own your taking.....,1

"Unpopular opinion warning: I firmly believe that there should be an option for human euthanasia in cases where the person has been treated for a suitable length of time and analysed by different doctors and all other options have been exhausted. If the person would still prefer death to the hell they suffer every day in their own mind. I think that there should be a mandatory waiting period for them to change their minds, or for family members to step up their game on offering actual help. The family should be present to say final goodbyes (alleviates their guilt, and also means no family member will discover the body, which is extremely traumatic) before a painless euthanasia is performed. Having this option available may prevent botched suicide attempts which can actually lead to injuries that ruin the person's life even more.",1
"My perspective: I abhor the fact that people still stay that ""Suicide is Selfish"". It's not .It personally irritates me when people say ""Think of how many people ,you will hurt."" I think these are all comforting cliches, that people just use, just to use it. That's why getting to know people is important . Because the cliches I just mentioned, I bet a few others feel this way. Those ""comforting cliches "" may only hurt more. For example those two phrases  hurt worse and as a person struggling with suicide ideations right  now that those two phrases just made it worse  for me . Because I was a ward of the state ,my parents gave me up and I don't know the rest of my family. I can't connect with people,I just feel I'm socially awkward or an introvert. So right now I feel really alone.But to be honest,sucide is not right. But what do you do when you have given life your all and you have tried to remain positive with such a crappy hand that was dealt. Especially since day 1 you were told you were a mistake.  Can you say those ""Comforting Cliches"" then ?  I have BPD, DEPRESSION,PTSD ,and  ANXIETY.Im not trying to be a debbi downer .Kinda feel like I need some help.Some people have no idea  what is going through a person's mind about suicide. Let's be mindful of that.",1
"I have to comment. I am a suicide surviver.when you have reached that deep dark place you do not think of your children,I have 3, they never even entered my mind I just had an overwhelming need for peace in my head.you do not think rationally otherwise the devastation you will leave behind will stop you doing it.no one wants to die,they just want peace.",1
"Susan Newcombe , ur so so accurate. My husband is suffering as u say OVERWHELMING  terrifying depression. Everyday is beyond terrible 4 both of us. Not being able to help him is dreadful. NOBODY understands",1
"I hear that you are seeking information to support you, I'm not one to say what is and isn't ok.  I'm one who struggles with this and I have heard many responses to this question.  I can only answer this question for myself.  In me I find my answer, and I can say that choosing to be responsible for my own life and yes I'm highly aware that loved ones would be affected by taking my life...the struggle is real and having someone who provides safety for you through this darkness...is more helpful then hearing about the impact it could have on loved ones.  I know cause I have someone who has given me the safe  space and can hold this for me when I struggle the most.  That when I have heard that I'm not alone...in this dark place.     My part is reaching out to this person when I'm there or feel that I'm sliding into this place.  I hope you can find someone who can provide you the safety and support to be there for you!  I'm learning through this that I'm of value and have been heard and healing can continue.   ",1
"To all of you saying 'Suicide is selfish' do you realise you're telling someone already suffering from crippling mental and physical pain, self doubt and worthlessness they are also selfish.  Shame.on.you. For adding to that pain.

If you are feeling that suicide is the only option, please reach out to a mental health professional.  Let your loved one know how you're feeling, call a helpline in your region, or if you have faith, talk to a minister/rabbi/mufti/person of God.

There are people that would miss you when you're gone, like someone help you remember that life is worth living.",1
"The idea of suicide being selfish is a selfish notion in itself. Constantly hearing or seeing people say/write ""but what about the people you leave behind (of which the person speaking/writing is usually one) doesn't help anything.

People who commit suicide believe without a doubt that they are doing the best thing for everyone they know. It is not simply about their own pain or mental state....it is much deeper, and much more complex than that.

As someone who attempted suicide multiple times when I was younger I can tell you with complete certainty that when you make the decision to take your own life, it is more about removing the burden of having to care for or deal with their issues.",1
"I have attempted suicide when I was younger and I suffer from depression and anxiety. To tell someone that is dealing with those diseases that suicide is a selfish act is wrong. You can not make a person who is already feeling an immense amount of guilt and anxiety about themselves feel even more guilt and stress by telling them to think about their friends and loved ones. In those desperate moments of suicidal contemplation, they probably feel incredibly alone and misunderstood. Making them feel worse does not help. Their brains dont work that way. They may even think that by killing themselves they are doing what is right for their friends and family. They may think that suicide is actually a selfless act. I am not saying that suicide is the right way, I am just saying that if someone is contemplating it, instead of putting them down for it, try and understand why they are feeling that way. Try to encourage them to get help.",1
"Wow. So many amazing comments on here and great feedback. 

Suicide will always bear a special place of empathy, sympathy, and compassion in my heart. Because I have been down that rabbit hole so to speak and have seen the darkness. 

I fear that darkness will return in my life again someday and knowing that terrifies me. I can only hope that I have as good a support structure as I do now to get me through future episodes of bipolar and depression. 

I don't think there is a straight answer for when suicide is ok or not ok because on the one hand if you say it's never ok aren't you undermining the severity of the persons situation? Maybe it's more humane to let a person go with dignity through assisted suicide? I don't know. There are no easy answers.",1
"I don't have an opinion about OK, or not OK.  I do have this thought- Are you ready to give up what you will be missing?  Is it so bad that nothing is worth living for because of what you have to live through?  
The pain, the numbness, the sadness, self-doubt, and lack of motivation can be the most difficult things in the world to deal with.  I understand completely.  I've been there.  I've been there with the blade against my wrist.  I thought, for a moment, that nothing was left that could balance this weight.  I was wrong about that, and realizing it was what saved me.
I want you to do something before you consider whether or not it's OK.  I want you to find something.  Anything.  It doesn't have to be any particular thing.  Find that thing and really experience it.  Whatever it is.  Really take the time to live it.  To get cliche, a sunrise, a hug, a puppy, are all good examples.  But it can be literally anything that you think of.  Live it, and and repeat a few times with other things.  Once you've done that, think about whether or not you're ready to give it all up.  Everything.  Every experience.  Every potential joy, no matter how fleeting.  Everyone.  Everywhere.  Are you ready to give it all up to quieten your brain?
Remember that no person is ever so much of a burden that they need to take themselves out of the equation, and that everything you experience is valid, and vital to you.  Nothing about you is worthless, because you are a mind, and feelings, and thoughts, and ideas, and an identity that will never exist again, and has never existed before.  You are invaluable, and of incalculable worth.
Think about all of this before you decide anything, please.  You are precious, and it would be a shame to lose you.",1
"Never ok, but I understand the motivation far too well.
We are overwhelmed by chronic pain that no one near understands.
Mental health treatment has become inhumane...",1
"It's never ok to give up even tho in that moment it can feel like you're doing a favor for your loved ones and finally achieving some kind of peace.  The reality of all of this is simple, it's just life and we have to live it and this is what our lives are sometimes a constant struggle to feel anything sometimes it's a constant struggle to not feel too much or think of get it scream or whatever is going on.  There is someone that loves you and depends on you whether it's your spouse, children, parents a friend or someone in this group that you have saved more than once.  Giving up is not an option.",1
"I can't believe for one second that ANYONE on a page about bi-polar, depression, and anxiety would promote suicide for someone struggling with mental health issues.  What the hell is wrong with some of you?  I have died 5 times from sudden cardiac death, twice in front of my wife and 3 times on the operating table.  I have endured 6 major heart surgeries in 7 years.  I have severe depression, anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia, and severe PTSD.  Some days the weight of the world keeps me in bed all damn day.  Sometimes all damn week.  But I forge on.  I take my meds.  I go to weekly therapy sessions.  I ride my motorcycle.  I exercise when I can.  I love my 4 kids and my 100% supportive wife.  I find goals and chase them down (right now my Master's Degree).  I force myself into situations I hate.

I have literally had the barrel of a loaded 12 gauge in my mouth with the finger on the trigger.  It took all my strength to not do it.  All my will power to realize all of the good things I love in life.  Remember, suicide is far reaching.  Had I pulled that trigger, the consequences in the future for my own small children, grand children, etc. could have been dire.

IT IS NEVER AN OPTION.  GET HELP NOW.",1
"Death is Death. Whether the person dies of a heart attack, stroke, or suicide it's still death. Just because a person wants to end their pain we should react differently? Any time a loved one passes away it's going to be difficult, it's going to hurt regardless. Most who mourn suicide struggle with their own guilt because they feel they could have helped. Suicide/assisted suicide is not black and white  and it is NOT selfish- it's very calculated. If you have never faced death you wouldn't know the pain.",1
"Never!  There is always HOPE as long as there is breathe!  I have had suicidal thoughts.  I know that this ALL is a spiritual battle and that GOD helps us when we come to him in prayer.  I have a slogan for those times when things are at the worst.  It goes like this. ""  THINGS WON""T ALWAYS BE THIS WAY.""  I have to tell you that we must fight a spiritual war to survive sometimes.  We have to choose life.  Jesus has given me the Hope to get through the toughest times.  I may fall apart for a while, but I know that I have solid reasons to go on living!  Don't ever, ever allow yourself to dwell on the thought of giving up.  You have a choice to make in what you think about.  Billy Graham said something that stuck with me that applies.  He said that ""just because a bird flies over your head does not mean that you have to let it build a nest in your hair!""  Makes sense to me.  We can choose our thoughts.  We can read.  For me it means meditation on the Bible..........on spiritual reality and promises from God himself, and reading how He has been faithful in the lives of others.  It gives me strength.  And Hope.  And speaking of Strength, and Hope, we can pray for strength and hope and every other solid spiritual gift we need.  We can pray for wisdom, and guidance from God.  The truth is we give up way too easily and let it become a habit.  You have to fight for your mental health.  To succeed means that you fail, and get up and fight for it again and again and again.  Each time you get up you GAIN strength and determination because YOU LEARN THAT YOU CAN TAKE A REST, BUT THAT YOU CAN AND WILL GET UP STRONGER.  Yes, STRONGER.  STRONGER from going through defeat yet NOT BEING defeated!  You are still alive, still trying, and losing even the faintest thought of giving up.  God put you here on this earth for a purpose.  He wants you to enjoy knowing Him and enjoy knowing others in a very healthy way.  We are all in this together.  People from the dawn of time have experienced deepest depression.  I love to read the book of PSALMS when I am feeling low or fighting a big battle, or feeling physical pain, or have to get right with God or find myself feeling like God is far away.  Sometimes we are just too exhausted to pray.  David in the Psalms gives us the words to pray to God under the worst of circumstances.  We can cry out to God like he did and be saved from the pit of depression, fear, aloneness, pain, trouble and attack by whoever and whatever.  So many times we do not understand that we are in a physical attack that has spirtual origins.  We do not understand that we are spiritual beings living in phyiscal bodies.  We can not reject the spiritual !  If God is for us, who can be against us?  Satan is still against us.  We must fight every day, but it is not meant to be such a struggle if we do it in powe we get from God in the person of the Holy Spirit given to us to be in us to empower us on earth.  Jesus said that he would not leave us orphans.  He would come to us in the person of the Holy Spirit and never leave us ever.  We can count on HIM for help.  How can depression win against Him?  We must be in His hands and He must be at our side.  OPEN THE BIBLE and recieve the HOPE that you need for this life and for eternity.  God is not mocked and we reap what we sow, but if we leave sin behind, and come to Jesus honestly in repentence of sin, and embrace life with Him, daily seeking Him, we shall be saved, and our depression will be lifted.  Bit by bit we will see who He is and He will heal us as we seek Him day after day in reading his word and in prayer.  Start reading the gospel of John and Acts.......and ask for help from a pastor or believer if you get suck understanding some things, but most of all, PRAY as you read the word of God.  It is the Holy Spirit who will become your teacher and you will understand and find great joy and peace in the presence of the living God.  He will take away the mourning and give you something to feel like dancing about.  It is not that tough times will not come.  The world is evil and we suffer, but if we suffer, if we allow God into our lives close enought to comfort us and guide us, we will have real joy and peace in His presence that is not dependent on our circumstances.  Sometimes we need special prayer said by spiritually strong men and women.  The power of great faith to perform miracles with the touch of a hand or word comes from the power of the Holy Spirit.  There are many ministries that profess to be of God but we are told in scripture to test the spirits, to make sure that it is the Holy Spirit doing teaching and the healing.  We can ask for this guidance to know where to go for help and encouragement in our walk with God. A ministry that is of God will not teach anything contrary to what is in scripture.  Never give up!  Never give up seeking God's help to keep on fighting to get stronger and stronger.  Defeat is just how we learn.  Sometimes we just need to rest and make some carefully thought out life changes.  God be with you always in the name of Jesus.",1
"ummmmm suicide is NEVER EVER okay. Got it.  It just isn't I know that answer sucks I feel that. I want desperately for a different answer myself but here is the problem even if you/ I don't think anyone else will be hurt, affected or worse off because of our suicide they will be. We cannot hurt others by our actions it isn't fair of us to burden others with our pain. I understand the pain is awful we want/need to get away but we cannot make others suffer the way we do.",1

Be it the people you leave or you doing the leaving... i think if we had a place we could go and everyone we left knew were we where and new we could come back, that would be easier.... but being locked away is not what helps.... the pain is so excruciating and at its worst you feel like your dying anyway.

"I understand that.  Depression is a horrible illness that poisons the mind.  Its not mind over matter because the mind is the matter.  But with that being said, what keeps me chugging along through my depression is knowing that its my mind that is broken.  The facts are much different. Ppl do love me. I do have a good family, i do have good friends, i do have a good job, i do have the things i need even though at times it doesnt feel like it....i know that its my poisoned mind that makes me feel so worthless.  I assume that doesn't help you with your struggles but it helps me.  I try and push out the negative and focus on whats good.  I believe that you see what tou loom for even though depression makes that soooo much more difficult and even impossible at times.  Just know you are loved.  Maybe not the way you need to be loved but you are loved. And with depression you can be loved the way you need to be but still not see it or feel it...at least thats what's true with me.",1
"Ryan Hayden Sometimes, it feels, its the only option one has. Especially when they struggle so deeply, with so much that others don't understand. In a life they feel trapped by, with family they feel are absent in their lives or they feel like the black sheep of the ""perfect family"", that they will never, have never been part of. After said person's dreams of a family of their own, are destroyed by miscarriages. The grief of losing a child/ren, is overwhelming.  Meds only go so far, therapy and hospital stays only go so far. You live in immense pain, physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. You feel like you are truly nothing and even though you have a great marriage, you constantly feel your spouse deserves so much better.... its not selfish, in many ways after the smoke clears so to speak... in said person's mind, they are actually freeing those they feel they have trapped with their pointless existence and endless negativity, that those they love can now be free of the burden of what said person once was.",1

I'm still around.. for them..... so.. we continue to struggle, to cope with all that we're dealing with, daily...Sadly, some do end up going all the way and ending their life :/.  Is just part of the battle.. the struggle, as mentioned.  But, this is why we seek prof help.. be it medications/ therapy to try and have things be a little better.",1
"I think this is too vague and complex to be answered in the same catch all way, because the human experience is just so different due to perspective. I'd like to put in my perspective.. I think people are both right in different ways. Selfish is not the right word however, what you are describing is actually someone being inconsiderate. They have a disregard for their family and friends feelings in the aftermath, they are thinking only of themselves. But, on the other hand, this inconsiderate thought is not to be blamed on the suicidal individual in question. Most suicidal people don't have the capacity to even think that far ahead, the future is bleak and dark and full of seemingly endless pain. I have struggled with mental illness my entire life. I grew up very poor and a homeless youth. During this time I didn't even know the thoughts I had were not ""normal"". My mind a physical being had so much pain it was blinding. I attempted 3 times. Not once did I consider going to family or friends. I didn't have family that loved me (still don't) and I didn't have close friends. I'm sure even if I did, I wouldn't have been considerate enough of their feelings to persuade me to stay alive for their benefit alone. The internal fight isn't about anyone else. It's only about you. It's a struggle within to overcome pain and heal what isn't working. By therapy, meditation, lifestyle, fitness, yoga, meditation etc. During this time, we have to be selfish, we have to be inconsiderate, because if we aren't, we will die. Deciding to live is not for someone else, it's not for anyone else's benefit, it's for me. I'm not going to decide against killing myself or mutilation because I think my friend will be sad. During the time I was considering it all, I did not once stop to think huh.. I wonder how this will affect the world once I'm gone. No, instead, I learned to live for myself. I recently decided I needed have more serious treatment and went to a doctor when my dad passed away this February. I found out im bipolar, boarding between 1&2, I'm somewhere in the middle. I also have chronic depression and ptsd from extensive childhood abuse. I understand more than ever about my suicidal nature and that it was only my battle. And that incredible pain you feel, is your brain keeping you alive. It's far too complex to answer this question, but it could provide insight to others that it is not an act of selfishness, it's an act of inconsideration. It's also an act of survival. Stop calling suicidal people selfish, they have enough pain weighing them down, they already spend every waking moment thinking things that would kill a person of less grit and perseverance (literally) instead what you can do, show them you are there for them. Don't try to pull out information trying to understand it all it doesn't work that way. But being there, helping them eat, keep them safe and supervised, help them clean up, enrich their life by taking walks or finding small joys. Make them realize that life is good, life is beautiful and people love them even if they don't love themselves. But please don't add to their hurt by calling them selfish, you're only pushing them further.",1
"I do not believe suicide is selfish. If a person has suffered for a long time with the overwhelming, depliltating side effects of depression,and medication, therapy group therapy, hospital stays and ECT has not worked than why should they have to spend their life suffering to keep others happy.",1
"I firmly believe that there should be an option for human euthanasia in cases where the person has been treated for a suitable length of time and analysed by different doctors and all other options have been exhausted. If the person would still prefer death to the hell they suffer every day in their own mind. I think that there should be a mandatory waiting period for them to change their minds, or for family members to step up their game on offering actual help. The family should be present to say final goodbyes (alleviates their guilt, and also means no family member will discover the body, which is extremely traumatic) before a painless euthanasia is performed. Having this option available may prevent botched suicide attempts which can actually lead to injuries that ruin the person's life even more.",1
"I completely agree. As someone who has made attempts on their own life after suffering for years with depression and a fairly recent diagnoses of bpd . the one thing that winds me up in that situation is how everybody tells you how THEY would feel if you did it. Guilt you and tell you they are angry. 
Yet the person suffering isnt doing it for nothing. They need support",1
"It's never ok. I attempted when I was 21 and I'm glad I'm still here. Even in my darkest hours, I know I'm loved deeply by many people who would hurt horribly if I tried again, or succeeded. I watched my father-in-law and sister-in-law suffer so much when his partner took her life. It's still extremely tough for my sister-in-law who just turned 12. Please seek help when your depression gets that bad. It may be difficult, but you'll find the light again.",1
"Instead of telling someone that if they're suicidal they need to seek out help, we should actually be aggressively showing these people that we care. A truly depressed and suicidal person does NOT want to ask for help. The whole problem is that they feel like a burden. The thought of asking for help is out of the question. There's too much risk from their perspective. No one believed me when I said I was sick. When I reached out to people they said I was actually just 'lazy' and 'selfish' and a 'slob' or 'faking it for attention' and in my mind reaching out meant that someone might tell me I was all these things again and in those moments I wasn't strong enough to handle that so it was safer to NOT ask for help. It's backwards and that's because depression is not logical or reasonable. If you see that someone you care about is suicidal you go out of your way to show them that you care and that you want them there. Don't tell them 'your friends and family will be sad' tell them YOU will be sad and want to do anything, even something small, that might prove that you care. Go to them physically. Call them and talk to them. Leaving it up to them to ask for help won't work.",1
When you've exhausted all of your options and are still so miserable you'd rather die.,1
"Ian. Are you talking about your own loss? Or have you ever experienced suicidal thoughts? Because these are two different things entirely. And I have never seen them treated separately. It seems that there is more emphasis on families who have lost a loved one. But those who have attempted suicide and recovered are leftovers. Just like an addict who is expected to be able to keep clean when they leave treatment. People like us are expected to go on living, but aren't given the skills nor the support. Therapy can only go so far. That doesn't often get rid of the thoughts when a depressive cycle begins. It's not like those cycles are only a few days. They can last weeks, months. And then just as quickly you will be thrust into a manic cycle. It is exhausting! 

Also families fail to learn about this disease because they are terrified of it. And there is a lot of dysfunction within the family.",1
"to feel suicidal is part of our condition ,most of us at some point will consider suicide to feel this way isnt selfish or cowardly it means          we need help we need to get better for our selves with out the snap out of it for your family guilt which makes the self hate a thousand times worse talk to some one hunni x",1
i dont believe we will ever heal or be cured i believe with self belief and medication we can accept and learn to live with our conditions hopefully without judgement and pressure from others,1
"Suicide has so much stigmatism to it and when people hear the word they feel like you just assulted someone. Suicide is never the right answer to temporary problem but it's ultimately your choice. No one fully understands when someone is at that point in their life. All the doctor visits, medicine or counseling will not help if you have reached that point. What people don't understand is when someone thinks or asks about suicide they are looking for help even tho they deny it. They are hoping just one person will reach out and help them. It's sad because a lot of people say and do so much that the person finally gives up because their need wasn't met. Instead of posting comments that are negative, rude and mean we should reach out to them and see if there is any way we can help. Suicidal people need love, caring and understanding in this desperate need/time of life. Encouragement that is not positive will only further their despair.",1
It is not a selfish act. It is one of bravery!!! It is the final act in this play we call Life. The people 'left behind' feel their own guilt for their own reasons.,1
"There's Nothing Selfish About Suicide By: Katie Hurley.
""I experienced a range of emotions before making peace with the loss. But one thought that never ever (not even for one second) crossed my mind was this ill-informed opinion that suicide is selfish. Suicide is a lot of things, but selfish isn’t one of them.

Suicide is a decision made out of desperation, hopelessness, isolation and loneliness. The black hole that is clinical depression is all-consuming. Feeling like a burden to loved ones, feeling like there is no way out, feeling trapped and feeling isolated are all common among people who suffer from depression.

People who say that suicide is selfish always reference the survivors. It’s selfish to leave children, spouses and other family members behind, so they say. They’re not thinking about the survivors, or so they would have us believe. What they don’t know is that those very loved ones are the reason many people hang on for just one more day. They do think about the survivors, probably up until the very last moment in many cases. But the soul-crushing depression that envelops them leaves them feeling like there is no alternative. Like the only way to get out is to opt out. And that is a devastating thought to endure.

Until you’ve stared down that level of depression, until you’ve lost your soul to a sea of emptiness and darkness... you don’t get to make those judgments. You might not understand it, and you are certainly entitled to your own feelings, but making those judgments and spreading that kind of negativity won’t help the next person. In fact, it will only hurt others.

As the world mourns the loss of Robin Williams, people everywhere are left feeling helpless and confused. How could someone who appeared so happy in actuality be so very depressed? The truth is that many, many people face the very same struggle each and every day. Some will commit suicide. Some will attempt. And some will hang on for dear life. Most won’t be able to ask for the help that they need to overcome their mental illness.""",1
It is never ok... ever... the family/friends left behind will be scarred for life... suicide is a selfish act... there are resources... reach out to them... not every day is a good day... not every day is a bad one either... the struggle is real... the fight is hard... find your resources and keep going... it might be exhausting but keep going anyway... do not ever be afraid to ask for help... keep going... right Ciara Mary Voelker?,1
You and your selfish horrible comments shouldn't be on this kind of site... absolutely disgusting comment you should be ashamed of yourself.. you horrible person,1
"Becky Bergmann Voelker - I wish you and your daughter the best, but please listen and understand when others tell you not to throw around ""suicide is selfish"". That statement is caused by ignorance. Often the person has the best of intentions and wants to help in any possible... but until you are living years with a mental illness that you didn't ask for, then and only then can you realize how deeply the mind is at war. You can have the best support, family friends and resources to help your suicidal thoughts, but you are constantly fighting your mind, feeling like you will be a burden if you DO seek help. Selfish has NOTHING to do with it. Seeking help is a struggle and yes, as you said, everyone deserves help... but for many, it is not the clear cut choice. It is not simple to choose help when your mind is telling you the world would be a better place without you. Please continue to become educated on mental health in order to stop from further spreading stigma. Most people I have talked to who have struggled with suicidal thoughts (myself included) think that if they do give into their thoughts, then they will be doing others a favor. It is a cruel battle between thoughts and actions.",1
Suicide is not selfish to think about or even do it the entire point of suicide is that you want to end your pan and not put those around you in pain the pain of you being around yes it's part of mental illness I know I have anxiety I have depression I have bipolar and they are severe I am in treatment I am on medication and I still have the suicidal thoughts and Suicidal Tendencies so does my fiance so to sit there and say that  anyone who doesn't seek help ithat doesn't make them selfish for all you know they could be seeking treatment so no it is not and I repeat not a selfish thing and it is very upsetting to say that it is a selfish thing and the fact that they are talking about it and they're asking if and when it is okay that is their way of asking and of getting help so why don't you try putting yourself in someone else's shoes before you say they're being selfish Because unless you have the illnesses and you can stand and walk in that mindset a hundred percent of the time you will never understand it not fully,1

I don't know you I have no idea who you are but I know one thing you're human. sometimes life gets the point you just can't anymore and pain confused maybe hurt. that's when you look in the mirror and you see your life is it that bad where you can't anymore or you can't take two steps reach out to help get help? this group is for you we can help you sometimes life gets to that point but I promise you it's not worth it.,1
"Wow.  That was my first thought.  And the rest of my thoughts revolve around the pain I have been dealing with for more than 20 years.  (Major depression, panic attacks, anxiety, bipolar, borderline personality disorder, chronic pain, suicidal thoughts...).  I can see how hard it is to lose someone to suicide; I, too, have lost people.  It isn't easy on either side.    If you haven't been forced to live with these debilitating diseases/illnesses, you can't possibly understand.  You (& others like you) who call people who commit suicide SELFISH, can you possibly see how YOU are being SELFISH?",1
"Why is it we are in a group based on support and we are focusing on how someone is being selfish for committing suicide? Do none of you making that comment realize the mind set the person has to be in already to make that life altering decision. THEY DONT CURRENTLY CARE ABOUT THEIR OWN EXISTENCE yet you are expecting their mind to stop and concern with others after they take themselves from the pain and misery they feel currently? That is not the way to talk to someone with severe depression contemplating suicide. 

They need someone to listen, someone to talk to and someone to be there. They need to feel understood, heard and loved and that this will get better or that they are not alone struggling with this. 

Do not insist they focus on others issues when they have such drastic mental issues going on in their own mindset that they have difficult contemplating decisions already especially to use words like selfish when you fully clearly don't understand the extend one has to be to be THAT desperate to make that choice even if you do view it as selfish or not. It's a misunderstanding on your end not theirs and you are speaking out of being hurt by others actions you didn't fully understand because you couldn't help them.",1
Deb Knapp I have been in that state of mind... And it is selfish.... One who commits suicide may be ending their life and their misery but they are hurting so many people who would have done anything to help if they had only known..... I was a selfish person but someone said something that struck a nerve for me n snapped me out of it and I got help n I knew that no matter how hopeless life seems some days there is a light at the end of the tunnel and things get better!!! Just takes time.... We r all strong n we can all conquer anything some just need a little help!!!!,1
"Suicide, for those left behind, is never 'ok'. Suicide, for those contemplating it, is one of the most painful and SELFLESS decisions. It's never about us. It is ALL about that one person not being able to 'see straight'. Not being able to see through their emotional distress, their broken heart, their pleas for help that seem to be falling on deaf ears.
Instead of counting how many we have lost......how about counting how many times one has picked up that pill bottle or held that rope?! 
We, and I speak for myself, can't look past the next 30 seconds...and know that it will be painful, but living is not impossible.  We can't 'take back' and undo once we have died. Life goes on but without us in it. 
Thank you for reaching out to us. For trusting people that you don't know. I am one of many that you can talk with. I only know my own demons but will hear you with all that I have. I can't save the world but if you want to talk, you will have my undivided attention.  I'm sarcastic and sharp tongued but also kind and compassionate. You matter xxx",1
"Andy Nicholson, I was also mostly responding to someone who said it was ""selfish"", which I feel is a guilt-tripping word.  I get what you were saying and by all means, remind them of those who do love them or if it is a loved one, tell them how much they mean to you.  Tell them why you love them and stuff.  Focus on them, and the positive impact they have in people's lives.",1
"Julie Barron This. I remember my mother persistently saying it was selfish, and I'd fall further down the rabbit hole.

And his approach was far more helpful than guilt was.",1

"Parent support group might really help with the stress of parenting and help you enjoy it!  Also the doc should ask you a lot of questions like, are you sleeping, are you irritable, do you have racing thoughts, and how are you doing at making decisions and good judgements.........sometimes antidepressants make people have mood swings.  How are your emotions?  How is your thinking?  Are you thinking a lot of a little?  Are you impossibly fatigues or full of energy?  Make a list and tell the doctor these things.  Counselling is really helpful one to one if you find someone you are comfortable with!",1
"When taking antidepressants and anxiety medications the side effects are hard. A person does well on them but gets immune to them after a few years. I would try talking to your Dr about changing your meds. That will help a lot. Also, lavender oil is great to breathe in for anxiety. So I hope this helps!!!",1
"Look into having your meds adjusted. Try some positive stress relief (music, coloring, beads, gardening) Move around & get some sun. Just got keep trying till you find what helps.",1
"Talk to your pdoc. I agree with suggestions that either a new med or dose might be needed. If you're not trying other coping skills or in therapy, meds can only go so far. Motherhood is hugely stressful and therapy is necessary for me. I have 8 kids, 4-26, all with various issues and some with serious diagnoses, too. I take time for me or I can't stay well. Daily meditation and a dedicated sleep schedule are critical.",1
"I hated zoloft. Though it never did that to me, I'm on what's called an off-label drug. Meaning the pill is meant for one thing, but they noticed in patients it was also helping with anxiety.

Educate people on your symptomatic behaviors & some helpful resposes.  It can take weeks or months for me to `bounce back` completely. Keep you`re mind occupid, set small goals, celebrate every accomplishment (even the tinest baby step!) & be patient with yourself.",1
Often times a lot of ppl go through that so you are not alone. I would seek out a counselor to be able to talk to someone. It will help. You may have to find one you like best but once u do you will find yourself being able to open up more. I get paranoid about things sometimes and think someone is going to say something so I keep my mouth closed but therapy has helped me in the past. I wish you the best of luck.,1
"As far as the before and after, I get to the 'after' with my 'wellness recovery action plan' a WRAP. This is absolutely online, and there is an iPhone app for it too.

If I flip back and see my ratings and thoughts getting worse I try to intervene why I am healthy.",1
"Last psychotic episode i took i was hearing things i was convinced the guy upstairs had drilled holes in ceiling and to spy on me and i could see writing appearing on wall.. I was sat in dark hall way hiding terrified to move for hours until my son came home..... He knew something was wrong with me.  But it all seemed very real to me until the hospital explained what was happening.  I was put on medication to stop hallucinations for a few weeks and opted to go home with a cpn popping in every day for a week to check on me... 
..scary stuff at time but with support of my son i got through it. X",1
"Often the people around me have no clue unless my hands get shaky or i am pacing and talking fast. At that point they assume i am high on something. Me being me, i let them assume what they may. Getting pulled over is no fun though. These things are misinterpreted as being high or having something to hide.... well yea I'm hiding my anxiety as best as i can. 
    For my shakiness? I take a benzo. This helps to merely slow the physical parts but not the mind as much. For the mind i am learning to be more aware of the trigger and not respond so quick to it.",1

"I want to add that my mother had bipolar challenges whereby I couldn't give her support and lived in fear of experiencing her harmful episodes.

they don't realise that they have hurt you and keep doing it but i think that it is my fault too cause of my insecurities.   ,1
My son is the same. I give him Benadryl when it's bad. It works really well for anxiety and puts you to sleep. His Dr. Said it's fine to use.,1
I don't know if they'll prescribe it where you are but I take hydroxyzine at night for my anxiety as it gets pretty bad throughout the night. I can also take it during the day as needed.,1
My teenage. Daughter was prescribed Celexa and buspar. Depression and anxiety,1
Not SSRIs because there is an increased risk of suicide in teens when they are on them,1
"Both my teen boys take Prozac and trazadone (antianxiety that also aids in sleep).  Both boys are ASD, melatonin caused night terrors.  After 7 years of no sleep the doctor finally put them these meds.  Quality of life and sleep has improved in the whole house.",1
"My son is 12 and takes buspar for anxiety. You only take it as needed and his doc had no problems prescribing it. 
I want to give you my 2 cents... I am definitely not against medication!! I take several and so does my 12 year old... but be very very aware of the side effects of antidepressants and antipsychotics!! I see a lot of suggestions in the comments for fairly heavy duty psych meds and I feel you only want to take those as a last resort!! Seroquel and Remeron, so on, etc, etc, are serious meds and I have been on them as an adult and would never put my child on them unless he had actual psychosis! They are both HUGE weight gainers that effect the metabolism, you don't want to start messing with his metabolism so young, they also are extremely sedating, and not just at night! They can have a big zombie effect! They also mess with the bodies ability to control it's core temperature, they are also linked to severe oral issues (rotten brittle teeth, etc). 
Obviously if you have to have meds then you have to have meds, but, make sure you study any drug before letting him start taking it.",1
"Does he drink a lot of caffeine? Caffeine is a stimulant and will make anxiety worse. Limit caffeine 4-6 hours before bedtime. A body pillow maybe with your moms clothes/ scent on it? I find something solid in bed with me thats comforable helps. If its possible or if you haven't  already tried it, a critter like a dog might help make him feel safer in his own room. I would be careful with the melatonin though because prolong use will make it less effective. Im using valarian root right now which is also supposed to help with anxiety. Chamomile tea is great. You could also try st johns wort but as with any medication, check to make sure its not going to interfere with anything else if hes taking other meds. Good luck!",1
"My teen takes Remeron (mirtazapine) to sleep. Our pdoc is also reluctant to prescribe anti-anxiety meds or sleep aids, and this was a good compromise. She has awful nightmares due to PTSD, and severe anxiety. She also takes prazosin to help with the nightmares. We also use the Calm app for sleep but otherwise no screen before bed, no tv, and we're careful about caffeine and sugar. In a house full of anxious insomniacs, we're vigilant parents. :)",1
"As an aside, my littles (4, 9 and 9) don't sleep due to night terrors and anxiety and melatonin and meditation apps are all we're doing. No doctor here would give them anything else. Pure parental suffering and no sleep for ten years. They're getting better with time, but it's been rough. I feel for your mom.",1
Yes teens can be given medication. I know in the states doctors do it as young as 2. It is not a bad thing to have to take medication. The only downside is addiction to it or even depression that can follow. I have severe anxiety and I have been on medication for years. I would also seek out something to get his anxiety down while he sleeps. It's tough being on sleeping medication but with racing thoughts in your head will not go away. Therapy may also be a good thing to seek out. You may want to try that first. If it does not succeed then I would look to other alternatives. Also your mum  could go to therapy to talk to someone about how she feels. It is not a bad thing at all. Therapy can change the whole world to a person. I wish you and your family the best. Good luck in finding the right answers because they are out there.,1
"Or you can look up the medicine in the internet and show your mom which will allow her to learn about the medication, if it would be helpful for him, the side effects and if there are any risks associated with the medication.",1
"Seroquel is an anti-psychotic that helps one relax when it comes to anxiety and fight the paranoia of becoming anxious! I myself am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, depression, PTSD, and anxiety... getting out of bed everyday is most of the time a struggle.. I have been on seroquel for 3 years andyes there have been times where we have to either lower my dose or increase it some. But it has worked especially for my insomnia. It helps me fall asleep, stay asleep and most of the time I wake up feeling refreshed and calm! Which is so rewarding!!! Yes I am 26 years old, but I have a daughter who was prescribed the same medication when she was 9 and it was very effective for her also! Plus it's not addicting and it doesn't cause you to be dependant on it! There are days that I can go to bed without it and I am fine! Plus... it might help enough to where it can be a short term medication and he will possibly learn and develop a routine to falling asleep and waking up in his own bed! It's worth a shot and I hope it helps!!! P.S. I live in the USA. But, maybe since you have been informed of this medication and knowing it is safe for kids and teens with little to no side effects, it can be discussed with your brothers' Dr... they both need some relief. So maybe if he denies it, look into another Dr who is willing to try to give your brother the help he needs and your mom the peace and rest she and her both need. Maybe one who sees that this is a problem in which they are willing to try to help fix and correct! Good luck and best wishes from the USA",1
"Most teens are able to take meds, and they are safe for them. They don't put them on stuff like Xanax, because that's short term anxiety relief and can have substance abuse and dependency issues. Most children and teens with anxiety are put on antidepressants, and they are long term and super effective. I've been taking antidepressants since I was twelve (im 17 now) and they help a lot. You have to figure out which medication works best and doesn't have side effects for him . Im on Wellbutrin , but there are other types of meds out there. Hope this helps   ",1
Has he seen a psychologist for some talk therapy? They can help work out why he is anxious and give him strategies to deal with it. Medication may help but I would say that most meds haven't been tested as safe for kids. I do know that SSRI's made my anxiety worse.,1
I dont know who you are.   We also share very simular illness in our family.    You are doung exactly the right thing by rwaching out.    You are obviously very strong.        Tell yourself. I am strong.    Tell yourself you love youeself.      You ars not a burden.      I oove my sister. Struggles and all.   God bless you.,1
I agree with the others....sounds like you need emergency intervention .... don't be afraid of going to hosp... they will help you get stabilized and can refer you to a psychiatrist for regular mental health  check ups...... there is a  facebook group called Life Inside A Bipolar Mind... you can vent and share in group online and someone will understand... also Google  NAMI... They have in person support groups and family education groups as well... also you can look at DBSA.... most importantly DO NOT STOP reaching out for help...if you try one avenue and it doesn't work for  you... keep talking to people until you find some help.. you can also  call 211 and they can let you know about resources in your area.... there is also a Suicide Prevention Life Line   1- 800-273-8255 or look online at:   suicide preventionlifeline.org  ((((hugs)))),1
"Bobbi Nicole Sullivan Sorry, I'm kind of a Zyprexa fanboy. I just think it's a really good med with mild side effects, but gets a bad rap because of the possible weight gain/diabetes risk. I dunno, when you've got bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder, pretty much any med they'll give you is gonna suck in some way, unfortunately. You just gotta figure out which set of side effects sucks the least for you. Personally, I can't handle the creepy-crawly restless limb stuff, or tremors. I'll take the possible weight gain any day of the week. But hey, maybe I'll be changing my tune if the Zyprexa gives me diabetes. Haha.",1
Call a crisis line asap to get help or call 911 to go to er to the psych ward to get help have done it don't be afraid they've done lots of help,1
"No easy answers - You do what's best for you. Don't expect them to understand. Don't care if they do. It's where self acceptance comes into play, and since I've learned it I have blown off some and went to others. Why ? Because I know it comes down to MY Decision not what others expect or want me to do .. I lied with someone for 4 years that wanted me at every little event as they were very outgoing this was 3-5 times a week. I literally made myself miserable and ""broke down"" because I wasn't meeting ""THEIR"" expectations. When I realized I only have to meet my own expectations and gauage them on how I feel I am progressing it has been night and day, TRULY. I go to way more things now then  ever have before. That's not to say it's a lot but it is the very important things. I also dread them far less and typically enjoy myself, athough of course the smaler the get together the better lol ...",1
"I've applied for a position teaching online after I resigned my position in the classroom bc of my anxiety. This job could be good, or it could feed my bad habits. At least I have to be presentable from the neck up for Skype conversations, so shower and hair done. Pants would be optional.   ",1
I no how you feel I carnt even try to have a bath  cuz I panic never mind go out anywhere,1
I hear you & I understand. Depression & anxiety are so hard because it's isolating and people truly can't understand unless they've been there. There are people who understand and who you can reach out to on here though. Please consider me one of them. And don't beat yourself up.,1
"I overthink all the time. I analyze everything. Sometimes I really believe that when I overthink everything, I become my own worst enemy. As much as we want to ""turn the brain off"", it isn't an easy thing to do at all. I have tried many times but failed at it. I also understand the shower thing. Last week, I hadn't showered or changed my clothes in 9days and that included brushing my hair. I'm not proud of this fact, but, it happens. My own smell finally became too much to handle and I showered. The funny thing is, after the shower, I felt amazing, being in the shower felt amazing, but the hardest part in those 9days was getting myself to the shower!! Depression/bi polar sucks! After 13yrs of marriage, I just found out a couple of days ago that my husband is cheating with some woman, well, it's been a few women online and now my marriage is over. I don't doubt my depression helped push him to someone else as on my lowest days, I must have been so hard to deal with and unless your partner understands depression or has been around it or has a family member suffering from it, they have NO idea how to handle our highs and lows. The mood swings are out of control sometimes and if I can barely cope with how I am feeling, how do I expect him or anyone else to understand what it is like?? Life is crappy, my future is crappy and all men are lying, cheating pigs, but hey, that's life!!!! Just because everyone else is hard on you, don't be hard on yourself!!! ♥",1
"Totally understand everyday is a battle I have the same here a party to go to, people I dearly want to see, invites to dinner all lovely things with lovely people but its a battle just thinking about going.  Let alone actually going.  Do try if you can.  I try and when people don't understand me I simply say thank goodness, I hope they never have to.  At the moment I have had my medication changed and its sent my head into a turmoil,  worrying and overthinking them.  Its all these things that are catastrophized by us but are small things to others.  Good luck, I hope you can muster up the energy. Xx",1
"I have actually been here and know exactly how you feel.  Keep climbing those mountains.  I have realized by this point I simply have major limitations.  I don't even try to force it anymore.  If the idea of participating  is overwhelming, I simply don't do it.  If I forced myself to do things I don't want to, I would be majorly triggered.  Saying ""no, I am sorry I can't"" is one of the most empowering phrases I've learned to master.  I've never had a friend that didn't understand it.

I completely understand it took me 2 hours to talk myself into a shower today even though I hadn't showered since Friday morning then it took me 6 hours to talk myself into grocery shopping and had a panic attack in the store managed to pull it together to finish then had a panic attack driving home and was drench in sweat and so panicked I couldn't get out of my car right away when I got home .... I wouldn't know how to act if I didn't over think everything,1
"Took me 6 hrs to get to the store today too. And then I also had a panic attack while I was there. Nice to know I'm
Not alone.",1
Go have fun it's a great way to combat the anxiety by facing it.,1
I'm the same. Things are really hard to do. I get really anxious about doing them. So frustrating x,1
"you dont have to go if you dont want to...dont pressure yourself into a corner. if you cant do it , you cant do it...maybe next time...its ok...its just a party...no big deal if you dont go...its ok...dont force yourself to do things you are not ready for...good luck to you...god bless",1
"Yesterday I laid in bed crying because our family had its first ever Family Reunion. People flew in from across the country. It was at an amazing place, close to me at a hotel on the lake. All my cousins there, who I love and hadn't seen in years..... and I chickened out and didn't go!!! I was soooo mad at myself. I looked forward to it for months. My cousin paid for the whole expensive affair, and I couldn't even show. Even with my nearby parents, and siblings going who I'm close to..... I've missed nearly every holiday in the last year. I know there is NOTHING to feel anxious about, and I'm an extremely confident person!! I also never care what people think of me. Yet, when it comes to family gatherings or friends parties, I stay in bed. We have a disorder. We cannot help it!!! I wasn't overthinking at all yesterday. Yet I couldn't stop crying to get up & get ready. I share this Bcuz you're not alone! And don't let anyone make you feel guilty!!",1
"I used to feel pretty much the same way (I didn't cry or get sad but I would stress out severely leading up to the event). I finally just starting telling people the truth. I don't attend parties where I won't know almost everyone there, I do not like crowds, I hate being hot so I don't go to picnics or beach parties. I really hate when people try to convince me to go: I'm 48 years old, pretty sure I know what I do and don't want to do. I hope you get out and do something for yourself that you enjoy.",1
"Yep that was me yesterday, feeling guilty too. But I finally had to tell myself to stop. For one thing, I'm 3 weeks sober (again) this Wed. I'm trying hard to stay sober for my well-being. But alcohol was always my social crutch!!! I just couldn't go yesterday, unless I drank to ease my anxiety. So I made the best decision for me, and stayed home sober. #babysteps",1
"I make myself feel guilty when it comes to events with my kids,cause they really don't get",1
"I hear you. For 2 years I had to take an anti-anxiety just to get out of bed. Because of my illness, I had to leave my job.",1
"Yeah my husband said he is running out of excuses for why I don't do the family get togethers,I told him to tell the truth i am not ashamed .I just want to be the old me.I would be happy with half of the old me.",1
"When I get hypo mania, I've get so much energy for days and days. I don't sleep,I don't eat,I don't need to . I can't stay still, I fidget to much, I talk way too fast .I'm super social around other people.( I don't have to pretend to be happy , it's awsome . )For me  the  most scariest thing of all is when I'm coming down from that massive high, ( it happens in a split second.) Then I turn into this furious ball of evil anger. The voices and the noise gets so loud in my head that I can't stop them, I can't control them, they won't shut up. Then depression comes back and hits 1 million times harder than before. Its not fun. Its actually really scary not being able to control myself, And not remembering what I have done or said.",1
I struggle just to sit still,1
Mania is great. As hypo maniA. For the first 1-3 days. Energy. No sleep. Clean like mad. Then starts the BABBLING The IRRITATED RANT. ANGER. NO PATIENCE. WANTING TO HIT. FURY!!! Breaking anything. Finally thoughts of SUICIDE. This is fun??  I think not,1
"I actually LOVE being manic. I get lots done, I have energy, I'm more open to human interaction, I get along with people better. It's so great for me. But I know that eventually, I'm going to crash so hard. That's what I hate about it; the constant dread of ""when is that next swing going to hit?"" The only time I don't like mania is when I'm in a mixed episode; angry, so full of *negative* energy and too depressed to release it safely. But it's different for everyone. I can see why some people would dislike it.",1
"Restless, pacing, relentless, plan making, ruminating, insomnia, re-hashing and compulsive, impulse driven... not a fun thing at all",1
"True that. Mania is often times looked at as being high. High typically conjures up thoughts of enjoyment. It's fun and exciting when it's ramping up but the fun goes away fairly quickly. The excitement stays but not it's not a good excitement. Feelings of invincibility, delusions, overinflated sense of self, irritability, reckless behavior and a really short fuse for those who dare get in the way of the goings on in our life. Our life being the things we are doing when manic. Taking over the world, building rockets to fly to space, figuring out the equation for time travel and in our spare time, submit to an overindulgence in anything we love doing. Did I mention reckless behavior? If not, add reckless behavior to the list. Before I forget, reckless behavior. That's just the 'euphoric' mania. Then comes the shame and guilt of the loss of impulse control, overcommitting ourselves to friends, family, employers and customers, burning through cash paying for our overindulgence and the frustration of having to get caught up on the things that really matter, which of course by the time we have our mental faculties restored are left completely exhausted and have no energy to do any of it. Mania is a dangerous condition. 

Then there is 'dysphoric' mania....I'm not even going to start that one. Most of my manic episodes are dysphoric. Let's just say that dysphoric mania is extremely destructive.",1
"my mania is angry mania, its awful...out of control anger at everyone and everything. its better now that im on meds, but its horrid when it happens, its embarrassing...its scary for my family...oh the fun of bipolar...its just grand...",1
And it's not the same as anxiety!,1
Yeah i love the part where im so high and i believe god has given me a special power and i feel amazingly in touch with everything... however when my body cant keep up with my brain anymore and i start to get close to falling then i really get aggravated and anxious...,1
I'm in that mode at the moment!!! It's so scary!!!,1
I get hypomania but I dread to think how life would be with mania :(,1
"This is how I used to feel!  I thank God that these horrible times are shorter now.  I believe growing older and having more insight into my bi-polar disorder and my severe anxiety and depression, has helped me immensely, as well as living with a very kind, supportive individual who believes in me!",1
"Feeling right now. To the point my oldest yelled at me ""I hate you. You're not my mom and you never were""
I wish I could explain the uncontrollable thoughts in my head. Why I cry b/c they hurt. Explain why I need space before I do worst. How to explain to a 7yo(almost 8) 
Didn't even want to leave home to go to work. But I'm here now and I don't want to do anything but cry",1
"Reach out ONLY if sincere, our paranoia lets us see through bullshit",1
Going through a shitty day and afraid to say it to my friends ....was out but it didn't do much good..,1
"IBack in the 90's I was put on benzos' to help anxiety and I became addicted over years of use.  They did mostly help but they made me so tired all the time I couldn't perform my daily duties at home or elsewhere.  I was taught different breathing techniques and sometimes it worked but sometimes it didn't.  Sometimes a ""good"" distraction helps calm a person down.  It's been over 20 years now and it's definitely improved most days.  It's differant for every person who deals with this.  Just try to do the best you can, no one in your life should be asking for anything more out of you than trying to do your best!",1
Yeah u just wish anxiety would go away  but what doesnt help  is what causing it wont go asay,1

"Being the mother watching is horrible too, no matter who its is it isnt a picnic for sure",1
I take welbuterin  for depression and anxiety and nortryptaline for sleep. Lost some weight  from welbuterin,1
Every antidepressant I've tried I've always gained weight on. Unfortunately it's a site effect on most of the tablets they give you. I'm no longer on medication as nothing works and now struggling to loose the 2 stone I've gained since being on bloody meds.,1
"This is all interesting, I worked for years with people with mental health issues, and realized I have them myself, it really is easier to help other people than face those issues within ones self, I took meds for bi polar, got fat, then stopped, drank and got fatter, stopped drinking as well, I am into my 5th year now. I started taking melatonin to sleep , high blood pressure pills and water pills, now I have to work on my weight and get it back down, the hard part is getting a mind set to set up a better routine , eat better and exercise more.....I know with the clients I used to work with keeping ongoing records was a valuable tool because you can see the results and work on routine.....people do much better with routines, and organized homes, clutter makes people nuts, I know this because I lived with the people I worked with 7 days on 7 days off , I and my alternates worked well together keeping things organized and schedules everyone went to bed by 10 and up between 6 or 7 depending on client abilities.",1
"I take effexor and klonipin and have for a long time. I was able to get the weight issues evened out after about 6 months and truly don't think it affects me much anymore. It's been over a decade since I started with them. Just fyi, drinking with benzodiazepines can be dangerous and withdrawal from alcohol and benzos are both very dangerous and usually need to detox medically. Alcohol withdrawal is often treated with benzos to decrease risk of seizures, so please be careful.",1
"Yes! I am almost 3 weeks sober (again). Technically I've been diagnosed with Bipolar and General Anxiety. I had horrible PMS.... they've had me on different cocktails of about 12 mental health drugs. At the same time I stopped drinking a couple weeks ago, I stopped all my meds except 20 mg Celexa (I was on 40) and Xanax as needed. I'm trying to see what happens without all the drugs. I felt mood stabilizers made me worse. And I feel alcohol is my worst trigger. Good Luck!!",1
Im a recovering alcahol i take mirtazapine for depression and Propranol for anxiety. I went through rehab and took baclofen for over a year to stop cravings and anxiety which really helped and anti abuse to stop me drinking.  Talk or ask to see a cpn....i reffered myself through the alcahol and addictions team on nhs..... Hope this helps. X,1
Yeah so idk about meds but i know i like taking ashwaghanda root for depression and valerian root as a sedative and a sleep aid. Also thc free cbd oil as well for anxiety.,1
"I agree with Jennifer Tenhagen. A therapist does not diagnose. However, the worst thing anyone who suffers from a mental illness or any form of illness have the tendency to look it all up. That plays tricks with your mind. The best way to bring it up is to see a psychiatrist and do all the tests. When you finish them then they can give you the correct diagnosis. You may have anxiety and not ADHD. That's why a doctor needs to diagnose you. I hope you the best. I was diagnosed in 2005.",1
What Jennifer Tenhagen has posted is very accurate so please take note of her advice as many people get confused. Your therapist has treated you very appropriately as only a psychiatrist can or should diagnose any medical disorder. A therapist plays a very different yet valuable role,1
"I use to have all these feelings like everybody else. I am reading these posts and i travel back in my mind to feeling this way for so many years. I have been slowly getting my old self back, my old life before i was over medicated and living in board and care homes and constantly going in and out of psych hospitals. I would pray and dream for my life back. My dream is coming true and i have been more than stable for 5 years. Yes i have struggles but i am stronger now mentally. Please believe it when i say there is hope and i am proof.",1
"But i never feel happy. I live in brokenhome, so i get confused with ""I want to be happy again"" or ""I want to be the old me.""",1
The struggle is real !!,1
I wake every morning with anxiety. Wondering how I'm going to cope with my day. That's what gets to me.,1
I just read that Lithium has been approved for pregnancies. The risks to the fetus's heart are not what they thought.,1
"Talk to your doctor about what the risks are, as this is your baby and you want the best.",1
I was on 40mg Prozac and 0.5 mg Rispedol when I was pregnant. My anxiety was horrible. Pm me if you have any questions.,1
"You should release your anxiety because it sounds like your thoughts are racing. Scrub,clean,bench press, Sprint run, get aggression out and Get that air in your lungs. Feel life! Your worth something. Your not worthless. We can do it. You can make it. Just push till tomorrow. And Keep pushing.",1
"This makes perfect sense to me.  The things that should be okay, things I've experienced a hundred times without harm still create utter panic.",1
Brendan Fry cause u overplayed disturbeds version,1
"I've been on both. I found them very much the same in terms of anxiety control, they helped to stabilise my mood somewhat, but neither one were great. I found the seroquel made me SUPER drowsy, to the point that I was a useless lump of a human being with no drive to do ANYTHING. However my partner is on seroquel and he's had no side effects and it's helping him a lot. 

The zyprexa made my appetite insatiable and my metabolism stopped, so I gained 15kgs in 3 months. 

I have now been put on Ziprasidone, and it's a life saver. I have found its the best medication I could go on. I haven't had ANY side effects from it in the 6 months I've been on it. But, everyone is different and medication is trial and error.",1
Seroquel helped me SO much with my anxiety. It's the only thing that ever helped me get off benzos as well. It has most definitely saved my life.,1
"Yeah I mean I was on it  years before this but I had the XR version and I think it's better if you have that one. But the regular seroquel is scary! Gave me panic attacks! And dude that's really scary I'm sorry that happened to you, glad your mom was there to help!",1
Get off the seroquel while you can. Horrible drug.,1
"I use seroquel as a sedative cause I have sleeping issues (insomnia) and I have Lexapro (an antidepressant) to counter act the depressive side effect of seroquel and to help me w my anxiety and depression. It works fine w me. I take 150mgs every night @ 9:30PM and I'd be asleep by 11. I used to take only 50mgs and it kinda makes u immune to the sleeping effect so my dosage got higher haha. Hope this helps. 

Also, seroquel made me lose a lot of weight. Idk why",1
"Also, seroquel relaxes me when I have anxiety attacks :) it rly help me calm down",1
"I gained a huge amount of weight, I was tired all the time and had terrible nightmares and night terrors. So thankful to be off it!",1
I have gained a ton of weight but the benefits out weigh my weight. Currently I am on 300 but i have on as much as 600 whitch makes really tired and unable to function. It takes away my nightmares and night terrors!,1
"My husband takes serequel for anxiety, but he also has schizo-effective disorder.",1
And they are very dangerous. When coming off benzodiazepines one should really do a medical detox for risk of seizures. Most put one on phenobarbitol for it.,1
Really? My husband takes 2.5 mg (not much I guess) so that makes me nervous.,1
"Both of these medications can cause anxiety and depression. They are very strong antipsychotic drugs, using them for anxiety is comparable to using heroin for a headache.
   Anxiety can be tamed with a class of meds from benzodiazepines or even antihistamines. You may also find relief from cognative behaivor, learning triggers and coping skills with out medication. 
    We must all be careful of how medications are used and perscribed to us.",1
"Same here, Thora. Have been on 100mg of Zoloft for just over a year (up from 50mg since September 2011) - I take it for both MDD and social anxiety, though more so for the anxiety these days. It's been a lifesaver.",1
"Perhaps both are true.  Maybe your memory has been altered due to time and the deep emotions that go with something like this and they also don't want all you say to be true because it's shameful and it hurts.  The truth is likely somewhere in the middle.  I think in making peace if you took the position that you were a child and some of the memories could be a little skewed, however insisting that nevertheless it has certainly contributed to your current state.  This might be a better place to start reconciliation.  Anyway...that's my two cents...God bless you.",1
O how I can relate!! I too went threw this same exact scenario! Watch my alcoholic step dad beat my mom when I was a small child! Till this day I'm told it's untrue...I know what I saw!! I've always been told anything that I remember as a child it's just my imagination!! It's horrible to think the one person in life that birthed you tells you ur pretty much delusional! I've learned to detach myself from my upbringing for I thought and was made to feel it was all a lie! Hope you find peace with it!,1
"I can relate... and this memory issue is not uncommon...
Perhaps you would do better to focus on storing those memories somewhere where they can no longer effect you or confuse you. 20yrs is such a long time to be dealing with this. Maybe  put all that negative energy, that will juzt keep you sick, into letting it go... This enabled me to move forward & focus on my day to day health & well-being.",1

"I went to a center for mental health and substance abuse (place for either or both issues) which was the real beginning of getting myself under control. They have counselors who I found were non judgmental, not pushy, and there for you to talk anytime. They have a huge range of resources and support, all types group meeting with people dealing with similar issues. They help you to understand yourself more and come up with solutions that are right for you. It's always a good idea to talk to your doctor, or a psychiatrist, but I found the mental health center to be the best support, you are in control. It's all about trying new things, a good try, keep what's good, pass on what's not for you. You can do it! I know it's overwhelming and it's hard to get a ball rolling, but it will get better and you will enjoy life as you find yourself more❤",1
I know exactly how you feel. I'm the same and don't bother at times talking to anyone including my partner. I don't think people realize it's just a struggle to even get out of bed sometimes. I don't think you should drop your partner. Try and sit down and tell him exactly how you feel. If he loves you he will do some research  or buy a book to understand the illness. Avoid the judgemental  unknowledgeable   people. See if there are group out there who has the same illness as u so they can relate to how you are feeling. These people understand so good for your soul. Seek professional help to see if u are on the right meds. Avoid negativity in general or zone out if u can't avoid them.,1

Failure and fear are my problems.,1
"Brenda Benefield thank you. That was advice from the doctors.  Anxiety turned into excruciating muscle spasms and seizure-like episodes that lasts for hours. Medication and therapy is a necessity also. But you have to help yourself. Find out about all the symptoms of manic dep., so you can win some battles. You will never win the big war, but accept the battles that you win as something learned. I,ve written research papers  and helped therapists on ways to come up out of depression. If you're interested, it will work for you. God be with all of you. Hugs to all.",1
"for me the last thing i need is some made up bull shit about how god loves me and ""we can't go on w/o you""  it's the misconstrued lies that make me fall further away.  this mental cage is a burden we place upon ourselves is a spiral spun the fuck out.  if you love this person, and i'm guessing you do, spend quality time.  make them feel they matter.  this hole is deep.  contemplation overwhelms us to the point of oblivion.  sometimes the best answer is silence along with companionship along with a smile.  this monkey is a bitch dude.",1
Bobbi Nicole Sullivan from my perspective yes ma'am.  drives me into a pit that i can't climb fast enough to get away from.  depression and anxiety go hand in hand with each other.  for me anyway,1
"Bobbi Nicole Sullivan yes, all this for anxiety. Too much or too little for you?",1
"Jesse is correct on the crippling effect anxiety can have.  A lot of times, the simplest gestures to show you care are the ones that help the most.",1
Bobbi every person is different with different needs. Sometimes anxiety (and/or depression) can stop me from really doing anything for myself. Social anxiety may not want to leave the house so it can be helpful to have a support network of close friends etc to help out if it gets so bad,1
Yeah if you wanna get pregnant...that'll sure change tomorrow no doubt...,1
oh dear I am quite guilty of this  - just have to spit it out or will forget it!!,1
"Yep, I mean    and yes don't worry I am/have Rapid Cycling Bipolar 2   and do exactly the same.  So both ends of the spectrum covered.             ",1
I'm guilty.,1
"So true!!  people who dont have a mental disorder have no idea what we go through to just try to fit in, especially at work. You get treated like your an enigma, always getting in trouble for having a sad or upset face, people tell you that your rude etc...  If they could just understand that I can't stop it, they say just dont react, keep a smile on your face, be nice to those that are rude to you, remember that the client is the reason that were here. Ok, well, Ive already explained my illness, the symptoms, the reactions I have etc.....  And now your telling me to just get over it and act normal???  Well, ""F"" you !  to all the people out there that think we are just wanting attention, sympathy, special treatment etc....  If I had a wish, and I could wish anything I wanted, I would wish that all of you doubters and non-believers out there could feel what we do everyday, 24/7, then tell me what you think of me!",1
So many stories about depression and anxiety no one says what to do to get better   ,1
"what should I do, I feel like there is nothing that would make me happy anymore, I don't care about anything anymore, nothing excites me, I have no motivation, the only reason I don't sleep all my life is because I have uncomfortable pillows which I am afraid to change them with comfortable ones, I feel so drained and empty...please anybody, tell me something a new perspective, a reason to live, to breath! I want to cry but I con't even see point in doing that..",1
Gevork Yot you are not alone in your struggle,1
"Weed helps. Reduces anxiety, relaxing,increase in appetite, the right kind can help you get motivated",1
Have a look at mindfulness on the net. There are even apps for your phone. It has been a godsend for me dealing with anxiety and full blown panic attacks.,1
Absolutely true for me I hate it if had just one wish it would be to take my anxiety away,1
"This could not be more true!!! I hate having anxiety and being in a constant battle with my brain in every choice I make!!! But... I am focusing on controlling it and learning my triggers along with handling with depression and bipolar disorder! I don't ask for a pity party cause I am fine!!! I have an awesome support system, w beautiful healthy little girls, and a husband who loves me. Despite the struggles he faces learning to cope with my anxiety/depression/bipolar disorder... and  he's learning a lot about symptoms and understanding what each thing does to me and how it affects my daily life! He is my rock and I couldn't be more thankful for him standing by me through it all!!!! He's the real MVP!!!",1
"Paranoia has become one of my senses having been paranoid all my life. Shit, even with medication it doesn't even slow down",1
Own it don't let it own you. I know it's hard because I struggle also but don't let it run your life,1
I wish i only had anxiety,1
If they only knew what really goes on in ones mind!! Everyday I struggle!!,1
"You just wrote what so many people have gone through.  My son, age 34 has been struggling all his life.  It is heart breaking to see him struggle every day of his life.  He is my hero.  But I hate the ignorance of so many people that just don't get it and shame him or his Dad and I.  He knows his disease well and is a good advocate for himself even though I go with him to all doctor appts.  He has learned on his own some wonderful coping skills that help us all out.  When he is angry for no apparent reason he will hold his hand up like stop.  We then know not to disturb him or talk to him until he comes back to us and starts talking.  I am so very proud of him and all the people that fight the battle every day.  God Speed.",1
"Yea I guess it stems from paranoia and anxiety, that's how I feel with myself. I'm very suscpious of everyone around me for some odd reason",1
"Latuda caused me to get akithesia (severe restlessness to the point I couldn't stand, sit or lie down for even a few minutes at a time) and I tried it twice as it had started to help my moods. Going on 2+ years and still can't find a med to stabilize my bipolar.",1
Latuda was horrible for me and listen to your body how you feel. Only you know,1
"Latuda had a terrible effect on me. I felt shaky but like a zombie at the same time. Almost like a bouncy ball stuck in a glass cup. I couldn't function or let alone drive on it. Everyone reacts differently though. I'd say try it out for a few weeks, if you can, and then talk to your doctor. I have found that the first few weeks of taking a new medication has always been difficult because of the initial side effects.",1
"Trintellix causes seizures, the side affects are horrible. My psychiatrist prescribed it for me but I didn't take it. I've toughed it out for 3 weeks. Go back next week. 
But I'm also on another med for my bi polar.",1
I just message this page privately and still awaiting a reply... I'm honestly stuck and confused.. I need immediate help (that is-- if abuse is an emergency)....,1
Latuda kept me from sleeping and caused my blood sugar to go high.one of the side effects of latuda is restlessness,1
"Latuda was bad for me.  Zombie, weight gain, threw up if I didn't take it precisely a half hour after eating, paranoia, and a general just wrong and off feeling. It put me to sleep like the dead within minutes and I was so tired all day i couldn't even stay awake.",1
"Latuda gave me horrible sides, different for everyone. Was the worst for me of all meds I've tried",1
"Been on 40 mg for about a year I really didn't notice a difference I was hoping it would help but make sure you take it after you eat because with me it can upset the stomach pretty bad, and I was told it doesn't even work unless you take it with at least 300 calories",1
"Latuda. The next morning I saw/felt the walls moving when I laid in my mom's bed and started at the ceiling. Super scary to see walls of a house shape shifting, etc. Never took it again.",1
"I have a lot of issues with side effects and Latuda has been one of the few I've been lucky with, and I feel it has helped me. My moods are not as out of control as they were, and it helped a lot with Bipolar depression. 
I take it with my dinner each night to avoid stomach upset and I'm fine.",1
"I took latuda but I had a bad side effect to it, I became like a zombie. I would shake and just zone out. It's called ackaethesia (sp)",1
"OHHHHH!
Beautiful,Talented ,Funny Robin... So Sadly ,Badly missed from our world ...So Clever you were at wearing the 'Happy Mask'...  I can so totally relate on all levels ....
Such a wickedly Horrid thing is Depression,Anxiety and such .... And sadly for Robin ..a fight that he could no longer endure ...will never ever be forgotten for the Happy he gave our Souls ❤",1
"So sad no one could save him. He probably had no one he could talk to about his illness, for fear of being labeled as a stigma in society.  God is the only one that can judge us, were not suppose to judge others, lest ye be judged thy self.",1
"True story!  Your body feels so heavy. And when your stressed out, it gets worse and worse until you can hardly stand it!  ;'''''(",1
"My husband always ask me why im so tired all time time.... why do u need to nap everyday or go to bed by 8? Only if we could switch bodies and minds for a day so the unknowing ones could then understand what depression, Anxiety, the panic attacks so bad u have to pull over for are all about. Not to mention having social anxiety and being diagnosed with bipolar disorder ughhh",1
Thats how I feel when I sleep I don't feel the anxiety and panic attacks I just can't get enough sleep sometime completely no energy specially with the meds I take make me have no energy exercise help when I force myself it's hard and depressing,1
This is me right now. Struggling a lot and my only respite is sleep.   ,1
Yes I've hidden my anxiety and depression for years I never talked about it i suffered in silence and felt so alone I don't apologise for it anyway more,1
People jus make one guilty n feel 100 times worse,1
"The only way it worked with my husband is him educating himself on the disorder. Before me, he had no idea what was BPD. He needs to have patience and to respect your space and you respect his space. We can be overwhelming sometimes and for someone that doesn't have a disorder, can be pretty hard to understand. Good luck xox",1
"Maybe have this person read about your disorders and explain an every day situation so they have examples. Tell them how you are when you're upset, (like saying things you don't mean, waiting for a reaction, maybe punching a wall) and give them a little advice on how they can help in the situation and the easiest way to prevent a problem in the future between you two.",1
So the cool thing is that you can listen to the birds in the morning without rushing off to work. I'm afraid that's all I got for positive anything.,1
"Unfortunately yes, it is a struggle every day to get myself to believe I am worthy and doing ok, and this is on my meds, before I found this combo of drugs I felt exactly the same as you ... and it doesn't matter how many people tell me I am special I hate myself and the last time I was sick I had to quit a job I had worked hard to get and had worked towards for over 10 years ... which now I regret and wish I had been able to cope and be normal then so I could keep working there, now I don't have a job, we barely scrape by and I feel so guilty that my illness caused this.  Anyway so sorry you are feeling this way, I understand completely where you are coming from so I am not going to tell you to buck up as I know you can't ... I am just going to say I understand and I care <3",1
"Yes. I do.
Been trying for 6 yrs to shake the horrible feelings I have about myself. Need a new Dr.",1
"i feel the same when my anxiety sets in and i can't do anything like cleaning the house .i feel like a failure because i am not able to do all the things ""normal""people do",1
"Yeah I feel that way everyday.  I avoid mirrors and cameras because they always seem to see the sad part of me. I hate not feeling normal and it seems like no one understands that.  And when I teach out for help because I feel like I'm having s mental breakdown in told I can't have one because I have a family that needs me,but how do you stop it?",1
"I have had bipolar one for 13 years and ADHD for44 years I'm now 50 years young, I too struggle with self hate I have never been normal and I've been bullied all threw my school, I often get really down just thinking  that I will have these disease s for the rest of my life, but then I try to b positive and just take one day st a time, hang in there, these bad feelings don't last forever                 ",1
Do you have a psychiatrist? As far as I know only they can give you the diagnosis. I too had childhood anxiety. However I also have Borderline Personality.But once I went to college I was pretty sure that I had Bi-polar. I took my concerns to a psychiatrist and within our first appointment and a series of questions I met the criteria. Lynn is right...I have had long periods of depression as well as mania. I also rapid cycle often. Some days my mood can change in a snap. But do get your GP refer you to a psychiatrist. I wish you luck,1
Im here for you to talk to anytime. Its scary I know,1
Hi. I have the same thing. And the same thoughts. I broke down and tried to kill myself with my dad's gun before getting help. I was admitted to impatient ward and was there for 4 days after getting out i did a out patient for 4 weeks. It changed my life. I've never been so happy. If you know you need help dont wait. Just go. Your gut is always right. Go and get help,1
When I'm stressed out and things are going well I take a day off and do nothing I take a hot bath I watch a good movie eat a good meal my favorite food suites or whatever it is and I don't think about anything and just relax and sleep maybe that's what you need to do is just relax take a couple deep breath and enjoy your day,1
"That is a lot to go through in a short period of time. Certainly  you have went through a lot of emotional trauma as well as abandoment issues. 
   I would be quite hesitant if a doctor diagnosed some one at the age with a bipolar or even many other mental illness. The reason is because for one puberty certainly had not hit at that young of an age. Other reasons would be that we learn emotional reactions from our environment. Which in turn means we can learn better coping skills. 
   By no means am i saying there is nothing wrong, simply that it is worth looking at things from a different angle.",1
Nobody even wants to try and understand. My work is especially closed and cold hearted with those of us that have illnesses and aren't a part of their click. They ignore me and treat me as an obstacle they have to constantly avoid,1
"There was one person in the whole world my friend trusted, He mocked her called her unmentionable names. Called her stupid you name it. I had to talk to her for three hours to convince her not to leave this world. So please anxiety and bipolar is no joke they didn't ask to be born with it.",1
Thank you for saying that. I feel so helpless for my friend she is a beautiful person and so broken right now.. Calling someone nasty names and being heartless when there confused scared and feeling lost is not ok,1
You need to involve your mom in your treatment. My mom/family didn't get it until I took took them to family counseling and to group counseling specifically for families dealing with someone with my disorder. You can't be upset if they truly know nothing about what's going on. If they knew then they could see how great you're doing.,1
"I totally understand! No one will understand mental illness because it scares the shit out of them. For me, I am always remembered for all the mistakes I made, or for one sister, doesn't believe in my diagnosis. She also resented my going on disability. My brother has a wife who can't stand me and he thought that every time I called him I was trying to ask him to bail me out again. Things I did before I got diagnosed and got on medication. But he still judges me and sees me as that other person. He was the one person who I thought would start to understand BPD because he got reading material I suggested. But it didn't matter. My whole family and history is pretty crazy, ya know? So after my first suicide attempt, I thought that I had really burnt some bridges. The only one that has been there through it all has been my sister Nancy. I cannot tell you how much we have grown. I made a decision to move away from my family so that I could learn to stand on my own two feet. While it has been a bumpy ride, it has been the right thing to do. I have a companion in my life who I am learning to love freely. And in turn, learning to love myself. 

My advice to you, try to find your own way in the world and people who will love you exactly as you are. Your family is never going to change so except it and move on. You are an amazing person for the journey and the obstacles you have overcome! Start to separate from your family, there is a world out there that is so amazingly beautiful, you just have to take that step!",1
"I wad the drug addict and the one with mental health problems. And with both I was told that I was trying to get even with my dad for leaving us when we were younger., that I just wanted attention, that there was nothing wrong with me other than trying to get my way.  It's all because mental health scares people in my opinion. They don't understand it so they blame the person wroth the disease",1
My mum told me I'm an embarrassment and no one in the family wants to be around me. Fuck em.,1
"You are amazing, your struggle is real and you have come far!! 
I kno its not the same but i wanted you to hear it at least once tonight. Ive been were you are as far as not getting the credit for the work youve done just to survive. I was a cutter as a teen. And i relapsed when i was like 20 and  when my mom found out she told me i was doing it to hurt HER, even tho i was tring to hide it..... 
When your mom goes off on how well your sibling is doing, walk in the bathroom put the phone down for just a second. Put your hands on your hips and hold your head high looking in the mirror. And say ""im a f***king super hero"" and kno that you are! And pick the phone back up.",1
"You can still love and support someone without having to be with them if thats what you choose to do, but i think at this point, it would be too sudden to get back together with him. Him proposing to get back with you is a huge red flag to me that hes desperate to get you- a stable factor- back in his life, whatever it takes to do that.  Sweetheart, tred carefully. Promises are nice but your mental health comes first before his and divorce  is expensive.",1
"if you follow your heart were you are scared and feel insecured. go for what will give you peace of mind and the opportunity to heal. your choice would affect your kids and family directly or indirectly. you don't need stress, wish you all the best. get well",1
"if you follow your heart were you are scared and feel insecured. go for what will give you peace of mind and the opportunity to heal. your choice would affect your kids and family directly or indirectly. you don't need stress, wish you all the best. get well",1
"Honestly, move on without him. He may be on a high right now, probably on his meds but has it been long enough to be very sure he will remain on his meds? Will he spiral out of control and hurt you yet again? All these doubts, all these question. Can you honestly tell yourself to ignore your own conscious? First and foremost, your children are against any relationship with him because they suffered right along with you after he broke your heart and then tried to kill himself. Can you truly say his love has more worth than your peace of mind or the peace of mind of your children? I personally would place the wellness of my children and myself before any man no matter how much I love him. Please think things through before making any decisions you may regret in the Long run. Many Blessings to you and yours.",1
"Since you have not invested a lifetime as I have, and your children and you equally agree that this is relationship on a downward spiral, I would back out without any further attachments. Sounds like he has gotten help, and it's his decision to continue. It is your own decision to take care of you the best you can. Guilt free. You have to, or you yourself will end up not being able to function. Continued treatment and support is the key though.",1
"Run don't walk the other way. You have children, He isn't stable yet and the stress of a regular relationship is hard on someone stable yet alone someone so fresh out of a trauma. Plus you've already said you found a good guy. Follow your head he's just trying to fill a void.",1
I really wish that the guy I fell in love with that would rather be scared of the stigma around bipolar that he just left me,1
"When she gets like that shes got so much in her head its hard for her to comunicate......believe me its very distressin for her.....But be strong, she does love u x",1
"Let her ignore you and don't take it personally. Maintain your own hobbies and such too -- these struggles can consume people around us too. You stay healthy and look after yourself too. Support by being stable and steady, and just wait fir  when she is able to re-engage.",1
"I feel the way he does!!! Always afraid of losing my man no matter how much he assures me I'm not going to. The best thing is to just let him know always that your here you love him and your not leaving. Its frustrating cause you know your not gonna leave him but he's feeling alone cause he knows no one and he's in a new place. It will take time but stick with it, he'll come around in time however you've gotta give him that time. Here if you need any advice",1
I'm really sorry and wish i could do more to help  ...    I was reading through the comments amd saw alot commenting about bipolar? I have very similar situations with suddenly getting really depressed and sometimes it even goes to serious anger and irritation in seconds...does that mean i could be bipolar?,1
"Possibly.  Bipolarism's best known symptom is rapid mood swings with little to no warning or reason.  It would be best to speak with a doctor if you suspect there could be an issue. 

I have a mild form that coexists with depression and anxiety.  I don't experience the highs (mania) but I do have depressive episodes that come on suddenly with no trigger, and they disappear in much the same way.",1
I find it really hard to work with other humans lol tried to get back in to the work place but people's attitudes and boundaries made my mh worse so I now volunteer from home for an animal rescue. Far less pressure and the freedom to have bad days without losing wages or feeling bad when needing time out.,1
I work at home frequently but although I find the office environment really stressful and on occasion detrimental to my MH I wouldn't want to work at home everyday as I know myself and i wouldn't see anyone.,1
I use nexium and sifrol..... Sifrol is a godsend for the restlessness and apparently the magnesium in the nexium would be helping too. The nexium was originally prescribed for heartburn tho..... Best of luck hun x,1
"In addition to the requip for restless legs. At bedtime I take 3 capsules of L-Tryptophan. I also take GABA to calm & relax me. Usually I take it with my L-Tryptophan before bed.
However, anytime I can take the GABA instead of my xanax. I do. Your body produces GABA, but some people benefit from also taking a GABA supplement. It has no chance of addiction and its easier on your body.
I buy these 2 supplements from ""Thorne Research.""  You can find them online. Their magnesium is superior to any I have taken. Hope this helps.",1
"I take requip for my restless legs. Have been taking it for 8 years.

Magnesium has also been proven to work in some cases.",1
I get restless legs every now and then. I drink tonic water to combat it. Apparently quinine helps,1
"I had restless leg taking Zoloft..I'm on a different med.now.,",1
Eat a banana a day. It helped me a lot with restless legs.,1
Yes!!! Every medication ive tried bar my anxiety meds have causes restless legs. Trying taking some magnesium and request a blood test,1
Do you feel and internal restlessness as well? Akathesia perhaps?,1
"On Effexor for many years, side effect restless legs. Nothing helped except Paxola",1
Klonopin should certainly ease any restlessness. Certainly have some blood work done to check potassium levels and magnesium levels.,1
Try the magnesiun oil spray. It's brilliants for pain and restless legs.,1
Magnesium helped me heaps with restless legs,1
I hate my depression and anxiety even now weve still got  tories and dup government,1
It may not be possible to completely stop anxiety but there are things you can do to manage it before it escalates. There are excercises you can use I think they are part of CBT mindfulness where you work through a situation going through how you are perceiving it and what the reality if sutuation is.  It's something that you have to continually work at you might always be anxious but there are ways to cope with it better.,1
"Listen to u tube meditation Videos on anxiety and relaxing the mind , works great for me",1
"I suffered from serious panic attacks and was diagnosed with panic disorder.  I learned that my neck injury was actually the cause.  If your atlas bone (top vertebra in your neck) is out of alignment it causes the interference of your body's ability to properly function, such as, improper flow of cerebral fluid.  It basically causes your brain to not be able to flush properly and is deprived of the proper flow of fluid.  My neck has been holding correct alignment now for three months and I have not had a panic attack the entire time, where I used to have them ALL the time.  If you would like any more info you can P.M. me.  :-)",1
That is part of anxiety and depression. We always over analize and we let get to us because we hold it in til we finally blow. Also things that seem small to others is a bigger deal to us because our coping skills have changed and things just will happen. Just take a deep breath and do one day at a time!,1
"I had a lot of help with taking Turmeric with Black Pepper.  That being said, I also had some help talking about my anxiety with someone.  I have gotten so worked up at my job that I'm having physical problems now.  Mostly lower GI tract, I won't get graphic or explain anymore.  Luckily, I have a wife who understands and is supportive.  I hope you are able to find someone.",1
"Its terrible hey. I have general anxiety, I wake up , there's anxiety flowing through my body. Anxious about going to the store, to being anxious that someone  peed on the toilet seat. I almost lose my mind.",1
"Unfortunately I was extremely violently sick when taking these,every time I took one I'd feel faint and be sick,then every time I missed it I would be sick too,so couldn't win,horrible drug,worth a try though because everyone else says differently.",1
I was on fluoxotine for 24 years and never felt nauseous  i did get restless leg syndrome at night and hot flushes.... They helped alot to start with but eventually they stopped working for me. I went from 20 mg a day to 80mg before changing doctors to one who agreed to send me to hospital to see a phyciatrist before being allowed to be weaned off them and changed to something more suitable. X,1
"I have had nausea as a side effect for many meds, but I have never acruelly thrown up from them. You may feel uncomfortable, but actually vomiting is pretty rare as far as I know. Your results may vary, but after trying 20 or so different meds,  I never had one make me throw up. Good luck and I wish you.the best.",1
I know the long list of side effects is very scary. I have been on meds for 27 years. Fluoxetine is one of my meds. It really is excellent...for me. My psychiatrist and I have worked hard on getting the right dosages and meds. Things are much better. But as frustrating and scary it is to have to take medication;your quality of life will truly be better.,1
I use Purata and it really helps.  I drink a 15 mg an hour before I go anywhere where I might have an anxiety attack and use a 30 mg at night,1
"You are the first person I have everheard of besides myself with this fear. You won`t know how the meds affect you till you try it. Did insert suggest take with food or on an empty stomach? Can you ask dr or pharmasist for suggestions? Do you have someone who can sit with you till you know it won`t do you that way? I wish I had more help instead of just questions. It sucks, I know, but you can`t know till you try it. Maybe some music or a walk for distraction in stead of sitting around dreading it? Idk but I feel ya",1
"I think it's definitely worth a try.  With medication, unfortunately it's a bit of trial and error until you find the right one for you and the correct dose as they can vary, but I was told today by a doctor for somebody else that that medication can help with anxiety so I guess your gp would have taken your situation into account when prescribing them.

Acute Anxiety can start at a very young age and can then lead to other things if not addressed.  Hopefully you are making great strides in trying to get help to overcome this awful condition.  It can be terrible at times.

However taking medication isn't always easy for some people, so completely understand the things you ve said.  Really well done for seeking help, best wishes x",1
You must try xx you will probably suffer and then you might not xx take the risk and let us know how you get on xx we all love you either way you have been strong xxxxxxxx,1
"It can be so hard sometimes when each partner has a mental health condition.  As you are in the US (im in U.K.) I'm unsure what professional support you have access to.  I've read lots of posts from people in the US and usually no mention is made of any support they are receiving so it might be that the only help available is therapy which you have to pay for.

Supporting someone else with a mental health problem can be exhausting in itself and if you are suffering too then it can be twice as hard.  I'm sure on one of your good days it is far easier and it can be very rewarding and therapeutic for you, I often thought that while I was helping others I wasn't focussing on myself which was a good thing as mental illness can seem very self centred sometimes which can be pretty hard to deal with.

I'm sure you are a wonderful support to your boyfriend and you appear to be really helping him move forward and gain the strength necessary to socialise and make new friends.  I'm sure it is sometimes very tiring for you.  Hopefully with every good, positive experience your boyfriend has this will help him learn to manage and hopefully eventually cope better with his anxiety, which sometimes it can be crippling.  I'd like to think as he learns to move forward this would help you too.

Sometimes when we are struggling ourselves we don't always have the energy to effectively support someone else too when we need all our strength for self preservation.  To look after yourself you ideally need help.  Do you have family or friends you can lean on? 

There's no easy answer unfortunately, recovery from both isn't easy, it takes a lot of strength and determination, some days we have those, some we don't.  It can seem a huge mountain to climb sometimes, but small steps are the key, small, but significant goals are important, you are doing a wonderful job by the sounds of things, but try to get help and take care x",1
Just reassure him. I have the same problem and have to be reassured constantly. Its exhausting. In my logical mind i know im being irrational but in my anxiety mind i think im being left.,1
A nigtmare...of false guilt,1
Right on point    you start doubting your sanity,1

"I am a Navy wife and I understand completely.  I have PTSD , PD ,Anxiety and Bi polar.   I am the leader of our support groups for wives. I got involved by talking to the Ombudsman.  There is support out there for you feel free to contact me in PM and I can try to help you as much as I can .",1
"I'm also a military wife. My husband has been away 7 months of this year for work. I suffer from ptsd, depression, sever anxiety and paranoia. We had zero time to prepare found out a week before he had to leave.. it is really tough with a little one. I temporarily ""moved"" to my parents for the time. As I stay far and only have a small group of friends. Our military doesn't have a group for the wives so it's tough. Good luck... you can do this no matter who says what!",1
"I have bipolar and my husband was in the Army 23 years, I totally know where you're coming from. I do suggest anxiety medicine.  Take it day by day, hour by hour and minute by minute.  You can do this.",1
It must be so hard I couldn't even imagine. I know it's hard but try and talk urself down tell urself ur strong uv already came so far u can do this. You will be so worried about him what's understandable no doubt he is a brave man with great training he will be just fine and be home with you's soon. ❤ stay strong x,1
"My advice would be as a person with bp 1 that if ever you don't know what to do to help her? Simply ask. If all else fails tell her she is never alone because you'll be there. However, due to experience with dating and moving fast, maybe slow down. Sometimes in the past when people said it fast I'd believe them and Bc of mania I'd have grandiose unrealistic expectations from them and get wicked upset if they don't live up to them! It has caused a ton of fights with past partners. I have grown a lot since then but since YOU are new to it, keep educating yourself (you get major points for that!). But overall don't give up, and if you ever have to? Explain why, have a set reason or issue you would have to leave over (ex. Cheating is a deal breaker for many people etc.) make sure she knows and understands that. I love that you're asking for advice here. It shows you care deeply. I wish you luck, and thanks for proving not all people suck and are afraid to love someone with a mental illness as it is literally that way for many people with mental health issues. We deserve love too and A-holes make us forget that. Sorry for rambling I hope this is helpful!",1
"That's nice! I have an amazing husband that has accepted and embraced me the way I am! I have sever anxiety, depression and bipolar! I can't take many meds as I breastfed our daughter and none of the ones that are safe work right! She was manage without meds most the time! If he wasn't so understanding I don't know where I would be right now",1
"My boyfriend and I both have anxiety and depression, and I think the biggest key for us has been communication. It's hard for me to express my thoughts and feelings because I get wrapped up in my head and I can't always rationally think through situations when I get panicky. He stays calm and gently encourages me to talk to him about whatever is going on. 

Ask her though. It's wonderful you are doing your research, but she knows herself best and if you want to please her, she'd be the one to find out how from. Good luck to you both, I hope your relationship flourishes.",1
My husband is just like you i only have depression anxiety and ptsd but he is working on understanding how my treagers for my ptsd work. I have only been diagnosed with ptsd for a little over a year.,1
You are awesome for not letting her illness scare you off and even more awesome for being willing to do what you can to help her.,1
"I'll give you this advice from someone suffering from bipolar anxiety bpd and ptsd there will be times she won't want to get out of bed. Don't force her. Just lay there beside her and cuddle. There will be times she doesn't want to leave the house don't make her.  She won't want to go anywhere by herself don't make her. You will become her sage place. She will become extremely insecure about the dumbest things........buy her flowers, cook her dinner, don't put her down when all she wants to do is sleep. When you ate dealing worn these disease it takes a lot of motivation to get up and hey Tatu because we dread going into public because we think everyone is taking about us and see what is wrong with us. Remind her all the time that tipu love hey, because when she is depressed she will forget and get desperate and think she is a burden to you, and think that being a burden on you",1
"It'll be a struggle every day. Make sure you give her space when she needs it but not too much, show her you care even when it seems like she hates your guts, because she doesn't it's just her brain making her act that way. Let her be open with how she's feeling without judgement. My ex was able to tell my mood was changing before I did and he would get me to talk about what was going on in my brain and sometimes it would stop or at least make the swing less intense. Let her know that on bad nights she can wake u up because she needs a hug and to be held and told how strong she is for waking up everyday to do everything over again. If she's too depressed to get out of bed to clean or eat, bring her food in bed and clean for her. Little things can mean a lot more than you think when ur swinging back and forth.",1
"Look up the Buddhist term ""tonglen""...in a nutshell it's the recognition that ALL humans suffer-yes, even the horrible ones who cause us pain. I have to see the person who caused my ptsd a lot as well. He's my children's father & we share custody (though I'd rather not). But I sit and look at him and try to breathe in his suffering and breathe out that he finds peace (and maybe remorse too....sigh). It helps. It really does.",1
"Know your trigers and . Remove them even if you have to put them in a different  perspective.  When my anxiety starts. I look at the situation  and deside if it worth my energy or can I move past it . Can I ignore some things and take a deep breath and distract  my self . Till I feel better . I have stop going places that are trigers  
 And stopped talking to people who are also.  Get you a therapist and yall work on it together 
. In three years I have been in mental hospital  5 times I had to learn to take care of me 
 You can too",1
I'm sorry you are going through this. I've been there I actually had to move away and even then I still didn't come out of my house alone to grocery shop or anything for fear of running into him.,1
"My father in law raped me when we were first married, my husband was serving in the marine's over seas. I tried to tell my husband but he was ,3,000 miles away so i repressed it. Then Whenever I had to see him i would self injure. I was a mess. Seeing him was tearing me apart. I finally tried to kill myself over it and everything came out. We made ground rules and have stuck by them for 20 yrs now. I still flip out when i hear his voice on the phone, my husband still visits him periodically it's not bothering me as much as it used to. Praying you find peace and are able to set down some ground rules you are comfortable with",1
"I'm so sorry something so horrible happened to you, so grateful you didn't succeed in killing yourself, and so thankful you are willing to share your story with others. Don't ever doubt you make a difference in this world. ❤️",1
"I struggle with ptsd. Daily I am triggered by something. I see him everywhere. It hurts both me and my current boyfriend. There is a therapy called EMDR specifically for ptsd. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're truly ready to battle some demons. Basically they trigger you until you become unresponsive to it. If this isn't a route you'd like to go, I suggest a group processing therapy. Best of luck to you, seeking help is a huge step.",1
"I also have ptsd and have to see the person that caused it. It seriously males me want to literally kill him everyone I see him because he refuses to take responsibility for what he did. I know what you are going through, and just to say suck it up is plain stupidity!!!!! I'm not saying that my fantasizing about killing mine is the best way, but it helps me very through it till I get back to my safe place. If you aren't in therapy you do need to get there. Me and my therapist are working on me not feeling that way anymore. Anger is part of ptsd and it is ok to feel that way. Fear is part of it to. Find a safe place in your mind sing to yourself, quote scriptures, pray, whatever you have to do till you can get away from him.",1
"Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a fairly new, nontraditional type of psychotherapy. It's growing in popularity, particularly for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD often occurs after experiences such as military combat, physical assault, rape, or car accidents",1
"I'm so sorry you're hurting. I, too, have PTSD, but moved far away so as not to be constantly reminded. I don't know your circumstances, but would suggest changing your routine to avoid seeing them if you can. And if you're not in therapy, maybe look into it? It's helped me a lot.",1
"I took it for a while but had to stop due to it causing headaches but i tell my patients 3 things about it
1 it tastes horrible (even the drug reps say so)
2 it will make your face go numb for a bit
And 3 you WILL make a face the 1st time you try it
Most of my patients tolerate it ok",1
"Do you know if he's having a manic episode, depressive or mixed? I live with bipolar disorder and I have different methods for different episodes. The hardest part about a depressive episode for me is that there is literally just no stimulation in my brain. Someone could run in my room with fireworks and I probably wouldn't react much to it. But because I accepted that my brain's chemistry isn't reacting properly and I know this, I've learned to force myself to get restimulated. It's not easy at all and it's a process that can take days or weeks with many speed bumps but 1. I get a decent amount of sunlight every day 2. I do something active every day. Even if it's only a 15 minute walk. But I try to at least go for a 30 minute run to get the juices flowing. Also killing 2 birds with one stone if you run outside. 3. I make a short to do list every day. Nothing crazy, maybe 3-4 things. And a lot of days I only do one, or none. And it's frustrating and I want to give up and go back to bed and quit. But the next day I get up and try it again. And I tell myself it's ok and try to maintain positive thoughts. Because the anxious and bad thoughts I know aren't organic, they aren't my thoughts. They're called intrusive thoughts for a reason. They come and they go but I don't let them decide who I am as a person. Eventually after a while of pushing myself I start realizing that I WANT to run when I wake up. And I WANT to get that school assignment done. And I WANT to take care of myself and continue building the foundation of my future. As a partner of someone living with BP I would suggest being that gentle support. Suggest going on a walk or run with them, or ask them if they at least want to sit outside for a bit. Maybe invest in something like a hammock, they still don't have to move or leave home but they at least are outside which is one small step closer. The to do list is big for me, my anxiety builds up exponentially when I let things like school or work pile up and it makes me shut down even harder. But when I start getting things done, no matter how small or simple, it really helps my confidence come back. (Crossing things off a to do list has been known to be a good way to release dopamine and help stimulate the brain). I hope this helps, feel free to message me if you have any questions",1
"Honestly, I think your approach would depend on what things he is/isn't doing. Is it lack of self care, lack of motivation to go to work? Deciding to stop taking meds without speaking to his Dr? Or self destructive behaviors such as binge drinking, gambling before paying bills, drug use, or self harm? Is it a pattern he falls into during his depressive cycle, or is this a new development? I'm sorry to ask such personal questions, but my advice would differ based on what is going on and how seriously it could impact his life and/or health, both immediately and long term. Sorry if that's no help, but if you want to message me privately, you're welcome to. Sometimes we need support and understanding, and sometimes we need someone who cares enough to push us out of our comfort zone of misery and help us get the medical help we need. I have multiple diagnosis, including bpd. My husband has been amazing through it all once he learned what was actually going on with me(he was great before, but understanding went a long way to open up communication so I could tell him what I needed and not feel judged/guilty/ashamed).",1
"First, be supportive. 

Second, try and work with his moods. If he's up, suggest going shopping together, like say 'we need new towels, go pick whatever and how many you want and we'll sort through them after.' Or 'we need a movie night, let's pick a few movies from this section' (the $5 to $20 section) 

When he's being destructive talk to him, don't yell and don't say it's hurting you while he's still in that mood. Tell him his feelings are valid and talk about them. When I say that I mean like... 'it's okay you feel paranoid about the thing, please tell me why so I understand and can see this from your point of view' NOT 'oh it's okay to hit the wall because you're angry'

When he's depressive, bring him water, ask about his day. Tell him it's okay he just slept all day. Ya know, do the little things. Shower with him if you can.

Try new things in the bedroom... Start with sensation play, tickling and running different things on his skin. Let his nerves feel. I DON'T suggest pain sensations. Don't spank or prick the skin with anything sharp. Let him know you're there for him.",1
"I don't have bipolar but I have severe depression n anxiety so I'm just gonna give u advice 4 what works with me
First, don't ask 2 many questions n don't go 'oh Thats so sad' n don't tell him that he's gonna got over it
Also, hugs r the best hug him but don't get offended when he doesn't return the hug coz sometimes I get annoyed when people hug me coz they think it will fix everything, but sometimes it doesn't n also, just listen 2 him talk my closest friends r the 1s who will actually sit their asses down n listen 2 me complain, cry n shit 
Idk if it will help him, but it helps me :)",1
Ashley Hazel Wallberg Snarr  please look after urself. Don't get too stressed things may get better even if you get back together ie if he gets help or changes his mind on things. Or it cud be fine if you stay separate.  Main thing is look after urself try stay calm do activities exercise things you enjoy try stay positive. Things change so much in life in a short they get worse then get better x,1
"Do you think I don't know what it's like? The fact that you assume I didn't understand makes you ignorant. I have PTSD, anxiety, manic bipolar depression and RAD. I'm not the one who gets child support you idiot because I'm their step mother that is taking care of them. Their mother doesn't get child support and him not wanting to have a job to at least take off his kids was my point there. So until you have been in my shoes and can understand what the fuck I am going through with my issues and all of the effort and Strength I have put into trying to help us you can kiss my fucking ass. I am not giving up on him I cant do it anymore because he is making my illnesses worse and I can't keeping living that way. I will always be there for him and those kids and he knows that but we can not be together anymore and that was a mutual decision. Not like I owe you a fucking explanation. You ignorant twat. I've been suicidal since I was 12! You think I don't think about it every fucking day!",1
"This comment has really pist me off, it is not easy living with ptsd or bpd, do you think we don't want help? Do you think we don't want to work? Because you are so wrong. Our brains are constantly wondering what the point of life is even when we don't want to think that shit it just happens, and then the anxiety kicks in and then the depression of constantly not wanting to be the way we are. It's exhausting for us, then there is the constant repeat of talking about the same crap over and over again with the psychiatrist,  you just sound selfish and gave up, you think your life is hard not getting child support? Try living with suicide thoughts everyday and not wanting it in your head anymore. Take note everything on your post is me me me me me I I I I i",1
Sometimes a job could seem like too much pressure or the other symptoms sound like depression. It may be frustrating but u can't force someone to do what is beyond their ability,1
"I too am in the same situation, and for years I've tried to be supportive and understanding, but now his job is in jeopardy again, he won't seek proper diagnosis, won't take  meds and just smokes pot. Our finances cant keep supporting this lifestyle and I'm worried that we will be evicted among other things. Its hard at times not to get angry at what can appear to be selfishness on his part. Its so frustrating and confusing and scary on this side of bi polar too especially when people say why dont you just leave, why stay with him",1
"One more thing, an important aspect of the article you condescendingly shared with me is that the author made the choice how to identify. In fact, quoting the author of the article you shared, ""Ultimately, the key is to ask, whenever possible, how a person chooses to identify, rather than making assumptions or imposing your own beliefs."" But, thanks again, Maria, for the pick-me-up comment. A little piece of advice for YOU - you have no idea what my issues are and may want to re-think the way you interact with others online, particularly in a Bipolar/Depression/Anxiety Open Page.",1
I understand you fully Judi. It soured rather awkward,1
"I'm on 10mg of Citalopram (celexa) a day and have found that it has done so much to manage my anxiety, and improve my overall mood!!! I still get depressive episodes from time to time but they usually just hang around for a day or two, and they aren't as severe",1
"I have mood disorder, depression & anxiety as well. I'm on 300mg of lamotrigine & 900mg of lithium. It has pulled me out of the deep trenches but I've come to accept that I will never achieve full recovery or be cured. Some days I start to feel hopeless, others I'm on top of my game. I never know which it will be or when, but that's part of the disease. For what its worth, my husband has seen a dramatic improvement since I've started my medication.",1
I've been thinking about switching back to Wellbutrin but I'm scared to switch to ANYthing now because of what happened.  I was on Wellbutrin back in 1999 for a few years and it was okay.  But I find with my mental illnesses that it changes all the time.  It doesn't stay the same over the years...it's ever-changing....sometimes in cycles even.,1
"The same thing happened to me when I switched from Zoloft to Wellbutrin. It was very scary & like you, I was almost admitted to the hospital.",1
"That's one I've never tried is lithium.
What it is for me I guess, I'm expecting a ""cure""...now that you say that. With the lamotrigine, at least I don't want to literally rip my hair out and get very angry.  I'm just wondering if I should switch off the Celexa with something else.  But the last time I tried that, I almost ended up admitting myself!  It was sooo rough!  Scary.",1
"I used to get "" your the least depressed person I know "" I now see a therapist twice a month she said not only am I depressed I have ptsd  and anxiety",1
Courtney Jaye the struggle,1
"I have high functioning autism and anxiety. I've been told that I can ""grow out of it""",1
Hope your ok Karen . It's a horrible illness to suffer. Much love xxx,1
"I have a friend that always used to say ""fine"" when hospitalised for Depression in group therapy sessions. Finally the Therapist said she couldn't say just ""fine"" but to express how she was really feeling (She's clever, but I'm sure it's not original) ... She said ""I'm fine! F**ked up, Insecure, Neurotic and Emotional""",1
I took it for I think it was a month and it would turn me into a self harming/suicidal zombie. It was horrible.,1
I used it for a few months and had to switch because of insurance reasons. AWFUL to come off of for me (I know everyone is different). Horrible brain zaps and suicidal thoughts; constant crying. Weight loss. No appetite. I think the no appetite might be an antidepressant thing for me. Good luck...hope it works for you,1
It really helps with my bipolar depression and anxiety.,1
"It has horrible withdrawal symptoms.  They had a class action law suit against them.  It wasn't working for me and they changed it to Effexor.  The muscle spasms were so bad, I could barely move.  Had to put me on methadone for a couple of months.  Sorry, it was a really bad experience.",1
"Today will be day 3 for me, 1st two nights I struggled to sleep and really dry mouth, haven't noticed any changes as of yet other then the above! Started on 30mgs move up to 60mgs after a week",1
Once you're on it do not screw around with lapses between refills. You will go through withdrawl and it's terrifying. The short-term memory issues are also very real.,1
"Lily Josh Jasy yes my doctor who has been managing my anxiety for the last 5 years said it usually goes either of two ways for people- calms them and makes them sleepy (but put on weight), or gives them heaps of energy and loose weight)... even though I have had weight gain, the positives out way that for me xx",1
"Has Had the opposite effect on me, I've been struggling to sleep and loss of appetite",1
"I guess the questions I'm asking are whether you ve had the opportunity to actually explain how you feel in full to your husband and then to your children in a way they can understand? That is probably the most simplistic and best case scenario to increase understanding for all.  If your family know more could they be more understanding? But, of course I completely understand it's not always as simple as that.  There may be many reasons why you can't or are unable to explain why you act or feel as you do, you may not completely understand yourself.  With mental illness, it can take a long time until you really get to grips with the symptoms, thoughts and feelings for you to understand it let alone anyone else.
It can also be that sufferers feel ashamed, a failure or weak In Some way that they can't cope or  spend all day In bed or can't get better.  These are very natural feelings, but it's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength when you can admit something is wrong, mental illness isn't something to be ashamed of, our brains are the most complex organ so like other parts of our bodies, sometimes they don't work correctly, and definitely not a failure, we are all different and we shouldn't beat ourselves up or be unkind to ourselves. 

Some people don't really want to deal with it, mental illness isn't easy for loved ones to deal with.  

Do you have any other support? With recovery, this involves many things, I wonder if there are other things which might help you.  Being a mother is very hard, very demanding, we might look at others and think they are doing so well and we compare ourselves and can't understand why we act like we do, but with a mental health problem it's hard enough coping with our own issues, is there anyone who could help with the children? 

Lots of questions, but just looking at possible options, take good care x",1
"I think your heart is in the right place, but just sitting someone down and trying to explain such a major feeling is not just that easy. I started to post how to cope with a loved one with depression/bi-polar along with anxiety, my husband learned a lot from sites, it may sound stupid, but it is much easier for family to understand from other avenues.",1
"If my boyfriend would let me this would be my permanent setup.  Unfortunately this is just through summer.
I love the sound of a fan, and the cool air on my face especially helps in a panic attack.  It gives the impression you have extra air to breathe.",1
"I usually put on a white noise track on my laptop, or music specifically designed to help you sleep. Has the exact same effect. Though I once had a dorm-mate who would leave her TV on all night so I had to pull my covers up over my head to make it dark enough to sleep, so I would blow a little fan under my blanket to avoid feeling suffocated.",1
"Same here. When I get out of routine and become ungrounded, I struggle.",1
"Moving, marriage, divorce, babies even graduation are major life stressor and case depression, anxiety and manic behaviour in people with no history of mental illness. We just feel it faster AND SOMETIMES harder.",1
Yes! I'm going through a big change also. A big move out of state. I don't know how to process everything.  It's all very overwhelming.  My husband keeps asking me if I'm excited about moving. I tell him yes but my face says otherwise.,1
I'm working on my severe anxiety by walking today.,1
"I actually decided to give up coffee today, as it worsens my anxiety especially on Wellbutrin. Cold turkey. Let's see how this goes.",1
"Yeah, but I'd rather not feel like I'm on speed and have a panic attack daily. It's really affecting my ability to get anything done. I'd much rather have a headache",1
"Might be best to have 3/4 cup today, then 1/2 cup the next day, then 1/4 cup ... etc.  will avoid withdrawal headaches by easing off slowly.",1
I have been having panic attacks and cannot get out of bed or do anything. Taking my drugs and meditation. Love to make some life changes but can't do anything,1
I suffer from anxiety but I get so angry it has pushed my family away they said to little to late  I tend to like my own company I feel that if people are around me I feel anxious and irritable and kick off  and say hurtful things,1
Yes yes yes and I hate it it scares me I wish I could stop it,1
"Oh yeah. But I have a wicked temper under the best of circumstances....but when I'm in a full-on manic mode, I have to distance myself from everyone or risk hurting someone...",1
Yeah the rage is really bad. I'm a very silent person and I keep the rage under wraps. Especially at work since I get bullied. I don't want anyone to see that side of me. I'm like two different people and its scary. That is why I don't have any friends or a social life   ,1
"I dont know whats scarier, wanting to hurt other people or wanting to hurt myself   ",1
The rage is what scares me the most. That one day I won't be able to contain it and go full hulk on someone.,1
Yes it can be terrifying especially when the thoughts of violence pop into your head. I've always had anger problems that stems from the severe bullying I dealt with growing up,1
"Christopher L Snead it's true and before I had any issues with mental health I never got angry or agitated so this is so out of character it scares me so much when it happens, ya know?",1
Not for awhille but when I got it out was horrible,1
Omg I do that too it's scary,1
When I'm not manic I'm quite stubborn and tend to do what I want. But when I'm manic I become unmanageable. No one can tell me anything. I zone out. Lose all sense of right and wrong. Throw consequences out of the window. And make a ton of trouble. I get very aggressive with anyone who says anything to me. I must admit I have never been aggressive in any way towards a child or an elderly person. I usually zone in on someone who I see as a physical challenge or threat and then let loose. Since I did my DBT course it's got a lot better. I still go manic and the urges to destroy and hurt are still there but I'm better at controlling them and recognizing them before it's too late. And I seek help before it gets to a damaging point. Like now I've been manic for a few weeks now and as much as I want to hurt someone the worst I've done is have verbal arguments. I saw my doctor yesterday and she wants to start me on lithium to help stabilize my mood,1
Apps are extremely helpful for in-between sessions to learn about breathing techniques and to keep anxiety under control,1
It's for anxiety. It is like Xanax.,1
I've taken it for years and 80% of the time helps great. If I'm having bad panic attacks or flashbacks it's not like I've taken anything,1
"I take .5 once a day at night it helps overall, but in certain situations I still get anxious and upset.",1
Ummm more then likely YES seek help immediately hun. Your ass deep in an episode and sadly it's hard to recognize in ourselves because we feel what we feel no matter how irrational...asking means you are recognizing on some level. Try to find that and call your doct or therepist,1
"Ugh, I once stopped taking my meds cold turkey for a few months, I got a severe depression and I even felt suicidal. So scary! I'm back on my meds and I'm staying on them.",1
I had a stroke in 2014 because I took myself off my meds. Have a care talk to your doctor right away. Call his service now. Do NOT resume until you have spoken to him. If you have muscle twitching and trouble speaking call an ambulance. Do not hesitate. Call your doc.,1
Don't throw out your meds!!! Never stop taking any of these types of meds without consulting your doctor it can be very dangerous.  Also when I'm in an elevated mood I often feel that I don't need mine and struggle to force myself to keep taking them.  Please see the doc :),1
Ive been on it for what seems like forever. Only bad thing i noticed was some shaking on a higher dose but fine at lower doses. I honestly dont know if it works i always feel like shit! I do know that you have to weened onto it because if you don't you can really sick.,1
I took it for about 2 weeks it sent my emotions into a crazy spiral some days I thought I was dying I had a horrible experience and was taken off immediately. For me it was the worst med I've been on.,1
"You're not alone.
Tips which have worked wonders for me:
Green tea 3 times a day
Daily yoga or other exercise
Supplements such as omega 3, D, and methylfolate
Corrections to diet! Cutting out garbage, sugar, processed, and fake foods, and eating as organic and whole as possible.
Obviously, not a guarantee or a quick fix, but most people would be surprised to find how immensely proper physical health can aid in easing symptoms of mental health struggles.",1
"I have Autism Spectrum Disorder and am medication resistant.  Before my Autism diagnosis I was given the diagnoses by various psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, and therapists od Bipolar Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  One PA of a very respected psychiatrist ordered me to be on a medication regimen which required me to take 13 pills a day.  One medication (very recently) had given me such a severe allergic reaction that I remained in a state of psychosis for 6 months.  An elevated white blood cell count (along with an extensive barrage of other diagnostic tests ruling out other causes of an elevated WBC count) confirmed the allergic reaction.  I cannot take psychotropic medications.  Because of my hypersensitivity to others... I cannot be in a relationship.  Talking about my traumatic life experiences to a therapist helped a little.  Reaching out to a free community service which sent case workers out to my home once a week to check on my suicidality status helped.  Hiring a therapist that performed home visits was helpful.  Hyper-evaluating myself daily checking for signs of progress was frustrating... But, helped me stay focused on my symptoms from an objective rather than subjective point-of-view.  Super-studying the diagnoses I was given helped me understand my enemies were not my family.... But, were neurological & psychological.  The only being and force that has brought me through to the point of healing I've reached now and delivered me from people which were feeding off of my illness was my Lord Jesus.  My God never left me. He never talked down to me, never discouraged me, and told me only beautiful truth.  The mind and the physical world have a bidirectional relationship which causes either damage or healing to occur.  The same is true for our spiritual life... It effects our mind and our body.  I had no choice but to turn to The Lord. I encourage other sufferers to do the same.",1
"May I asked how you were diagnosed with a treatment-resistant form? I'm curious because I've never heard of that and my bipolar type 1 mixed-severe, adult ADHD, general anxiety, panic disorder, PTSD, social anxiety, severe insomnia,etc. have always been difficult to control by therapy, meds, Eastern or Western, or alternative medicine, etc. I'm trying to figure out how I can afford to find the right psychiatrist, psychologist/therapist to help me figure out what to do. My last therapist and psychiatrist both recognized the stubborn nature of my various disorders but I had to quit my job and I could no longer afford the co-pays for prescriptions and doctor and therapist co-pays. I can't go back to see them because I owe their group practice over $600 in co-pays and their billing office and now the collection agency can't seem to give me a break. I'm quite terrified trying to make it without professional help  I'm afraid I'm stuck.",1

"I have talked to my Dr about ECT, and I have, as I said, researched it - and roughly 60% of the information/cases I'm finding where people who have had it have actually reported how they are doing months/years afterwards have shown substantial long term effects from this treatment. They report a euphoria type effect after treatments that can last maybe 6 months, after which their depression goes back to how it was, OR it's worse + they suffer deficits they never reported having before. There is also evidence that hospitals/dr. who administer this treatment do not keep records of following up with the patients who've completed their ECT sessions longer than 60days approximate.
The risk factor for this treatment, at least to me, far far FAR outweighs any possible benefit.",1

Your body is going through a huge transition and your hormones are all over the place too. Sometimes, we put things down to our bi-polar, when actually, we are going/feeling totally normal emotions, feelings and tiredness related to something else.
I definitely would keep in touch with your GP though. Even if it's only to talk about how you're feeling, what you're thinking and to relay any of your worries or concerns to them. Sometimes, just talking things through with someone can make you feel better. And your GP can also give u lots of advice and reassurance. 
I personally, wouldn't change my medication at such a time. You're nearly there now. 
I'm the same over my medication now, due to previous changes made. I didn't react well to the ones they wanted me to try, and I had to stand my ground  about reverting back to my original meds of Sertraline and Quetiapine.
If it's not broken, don't fix it, I say. 
Maybe it is just that you're just going through the normal pregnancy motions. 
And always remember. You are strong, brave and courageous. Not only because you battle on every day with your own issues. But also because u are fighting through pregnancy and for your baby. 
You're a trooper!!! Never forget that!!!
I wish u all the luck in the world, and best wishes in the future. Tx",1
Go to the doctor. Pregnancy changes your hormones so much and they'll go up and down really bad. Especially after birth. You can choose not to change your meds but your doctor needs to be aware of this. And a change of meds can be a temp thing til your hormones settle some from the pregnancy. Also post partum depression is a very real threat especially to those of us with a history of mental illness. Please don't try to just tough it out go get help. You want to be your best for your child? Then you need to take care of yourself first. It's like the same concept when your on a plane you put your oxygen mask on first then your child's. You can't care for a tiny human if you dont care for yourself. Trust me. I'm 4 weeks post partum diagnosed post partum depression. There's a lot of times taking care of my baby is really hard. Like really hard. But it's easier to handle by taking care of myself.,1
"Yes go to the doc!
Your body undergoes so many changes during pregnancy that what used to work may not anymore.
I was finally put on anxiety meds in my 8th month of pregnancy because my anxiety was spiking my blood pressure so high!
I would go to your OBGYN and see if he/she had any advice on what to try that will not affect your baby. I got my prescription from mine because I trusted him to know the affects better than my GP would",1
"I was on Prozac when I got pregnant, and came off. Although considered safe, being on it in the 3rd trimester can cause the baby to suffer from withdrawal. I'm struggling but hanging on, also in my 3rd trimester now. It's a risk/benefit weighing game and it's hard. Personally, I'll be doing limited breastfeeding after birth so I can get on a full spectrum of meds and treat it aggressively. Best of luck to you hun, we mommas put up with a lot!",1
Oh wow. I was on 400mgs of Seroquel when I fell pregnant. Dropped it cold turkey cause I was so worried about what it would do to bub. Ive got a healthy almost 10 month old now and the depression and getting back stable has been hard. But I'm coming good.,1
Arent u worried about the effects of the medication on ur unborn child? Yikes! Hope ur child is born healthy and happy.,1
The doctor would take into consideration the side effects verses the good of both mother and baby.thats what she is saying.that she's worried about the baby and herself.encouragement not judgment,1
"Of course this lady would worry about her baby! What a silly question!! She is asking for help not for you to judge her! I am bipolar, I have 2 children. My first I was not on medication, I had very bad postnatal depression because of not having medication while pregnant, this affected my child more then tablets would have! I just couldn't bond with her! Thankfully by the time doctors had figured out what was wrong and started me on medication! The bond that me and my first child is now amazing and my second child I took medication through my whole pregnancy for her, she was healthy at birth weighing a nice weight and the best thing I felt ""normal"" and I bonded with my child straight away..... if I ever have a 3 I wouldn't stop my medication unless I was told to by doctors for any reason!",1
Very true.i fight my depression everyday.somedays I win and some days it wins.my doc has cut down my anxiety and depression meds really????,1
"I rapid cycle which for me means that I am manic way more often than not. During these phases with my hypersexuality, its like walking around as an exposed nerve. The wind blows and you want it. The riskier the better, the rougher the better. It has destroyed relationships.",1
Yes. I've lost people really important to me due to hypersexuality. They can't understand how that person is not who I am; how I can't control it or how ashamed I get of my actions,1
yes the shame is the worst. I have lost my wife and children because of it! I live alone in fear of being with anyone now.,1
It's sucks.. relationships have failed because they start to think it's only about sex and it's not... And then I have my down cycles where I don't even want to be touched and they take it personally... I feel so ashamed trying to talk about because our culture teaches us that sex is taboo,1
"I have lost friends since my teens because of this issue. It's a relief to discuss really. Whether in being promiscuous or continually wanting to self relieve.
Very embarrassing when caught or think you may have been. A constant battle.",1
I have major depressive disorder but have this issue. The dr told me that my mind was just more like a mans than a woman's when it came to sex.  I was really upset cause that answer didn't help me at all.,1
Every doc I've been to has asked about that. I knew at times my drive was over the top but I would've never connected it to my illness. I actually had to have a doc sit down and explain it to me before I accepted it. Now when I'm even partially manic I refuse to have sex even if I'm in a committed relationship. I find myself to get irritated when they don't scratch the itch that tends to never go away so to prevent an argument I just keep my legs closed until I know I'm level again. The depressed episode has an affect on my sex drive as well. If I fall too low just for someone to touch me pisses my soul off to the point where I'll go sleep on the couch because just wrapping his arm around me tends to irritate me.,1
"This is something that has caused me a lot of pain and struggle... And if I ever mentioned it to therapists or psychiatrists, they either wrote it off or blamed me for lack of self control... This is why it's important to have a good therapist.",1
I am sorry you feel shame. Your feelings are perfectly normal for someone in your situation.,1
"My GOD, I am very sorry Amber Peacock. I have a fear of getting involved in relationships which SUCKS, bc sometimes it can be lonely.",1
but seriously at least here in the states we are so repressed about sex I can see how this would be a problem no one want to talk about sex. I mean unless they are bragging or something. It is weird how we handle sex in the states. It isn't handled in a healthy way by anyone even the mentally healthy.,1
Happens in a manic state and is part of the instant gratification mood. For some this can be harmful and they may become abusive in behavior. But don't worry most are just over active at times- that's my take.,1
"You just do! But before that, before I turned 28, I struggled a lot! After I turned 28 I learned how to control it a little more easier! Don't get me wrong, I still deal with it! Just not as bad prior!",1
"No problem! Also, it's even possible to feel intensely turned on physically even when you are not even close to being turned on mentally or emotionally, especially in situations that remind you of past traumatic events. This is actually one thing that I was super ashamed of before finally talking to my Dr. It's basically your brains way of coping with an anxiety inducing situation and/or flashback. It's a physical manifestation of an anxiety attack, no different than hyperventilating. For years I felt ashamed and disgusted for having this reaction to certain movie scenes. I thought I was a disgusting person for being able to feel sick to my stomach, ashamed, and aroused at the same time. Talking to my Dr and finding out that w my conditions and history as a victim of violence, that it was not uncommon to have these contradicting feelings was honestly life changing. Being aware that I wasn't some pervert, and why it was happening, and being able to start acknowledging and processing through those feelings and issues was a huge step in the right direction for my mental and emotional health. I wish I would have had such a supportive and understanding Dr in my teenage years, when I really struggled with things. A supportive Dr and supportive partner are two invaluable things to have when you're dealing w mental health concerns. Having a partner who can go w the flow and not question when I need it right that minute or when I just want to cuddle for two months is great. It takes the pressure off for feeling like ""you should do it because you're supposed to want to do it"", and none of those guilt trips for sex when you're in a depressive state.

Sorry, I guess I've went much farther into detail than you asked for. I guess I just wanted you to know that you're not alone, you're not ""wrong"" or broken for having these feelings, and it is completely possible to have a happy, healthy sex life and relationship/marriage with these issues once you learn your triggers and moods and communicate w your partner and find a happy middle ground together.",1
"Unfortunately, it is a real issue. Idk if it's caused by a hormones fluctuation due to chemical changes when we hit a manic phase, or what exactly. But it's like you crave sex like you're in heat, and get a euphoric physical and emotional high off of it. Then in depressive phases, we usually don't crave sex as much and want a more emotionally nurturing relationship.

It can lead to issues such as risky sexual behavior, putting yourself in potentially dangerous situations you normally wouldn't such as one night stands or not using a condom, and even put you in a position to seek emotional sexual validation from someone besides your partner or even actually physically cheat on your partner, even if you're not the ""cheating type"". Sometimes emotional sexual validation is  enough, such as your partner telling you how beautiful/sexy you are and being flirty. Other times, if you're feeling more emotionally distant, you may feel the need to get down and dirty multiple times before you can feel satisfied for the time being. It's also not uncommon to desire more ""primal"" rough, meaningless sex during these phases and feel left wanting if you are normally they type who enjoys more gentle love making. Without communication, it can lead to frustration in the bedroom. With good communication, you partner can learn to read you signs of manic state and be able to adjust their approach to sex accordingly. But first they have to be able to understand why you're feeling this way and what they can do to help, what to avoid, and so on. 

Sorry, I may have had one too many conversations w my psychiatrist concerning sex as some of my issues disturbed me until I found out they were pretty normal for ppl w my diagnosis. Learning that there was not anything ""wrong"" w me, it's just how my brain works, definitely made it easier to talk to my husband about without feeling ashamed.

Feel free to pm me if you'd like to ask any questions in private.",1
Actually Google is not all that reliable. However I have to know if this statement us true and if Hypersexuality is real as I have question about my own sexuality reagrding my diagnosis with Depression/Anxiety.,1
"It can lead to risky behavior, especially in severe cases. Think, Black Snake Moan type behavior.   In a committed relationship it can be fun to enjoy though.",1
Absolutely I go through those same thoughts every day I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder anxiety with panic attacks PTSD add and severe depression have you considered seeking out a therapist or a psychiatrist to read diagnosis and see if medication may help?,1
Id like to but i never really knew where to begin i started having stress tics and went to a neurologist and they prescribed me topamax to help with my anxiety and i told them it didnt do anything and they never really listened to me and i just quit going and taking the meds after awhile because it seemed they didnt want to help no matter what i told them. I think im going to go to my regular doctor and find out what she can do to help me.,1
OMG! I miss ME more than anything else that I've lost through all of my struggles.,1
It's such a horrible illness to have. I'm right there with you Carmen!!!,1
Friend I have been through the whole gamut of depression and angziety meds and cymbalta is one of those that work well for the one's it works for and dosen't work well in the long run for some I would suggests that you have a good talk with the doc and please let him know how you are feeling for your well being friend . I have been where you are very depressed and felt like all would be better with out me my fiancee' is my best friend she seen my moods and total lack of desire to do anything I was in facked giving up on everything and everyone so I really do know how you feel friend and I'll share this with you I went all the way to the act of taking my life thank god someone saw me and called for help . I told you all of this so you know that I feel your pain and know your true feelings so please talk to the Dr and I'm sure many people have told you that I'll be hear if you need to talk but I really mean that I'll be hear I know how the thoughts and feelings can be overwhelming ....take care and stay in touch if I can help ...you are a good person and you are worth it,1
I stated taking cymbalta last month and they started me at 60 Mg I got really bad shakes in my hands for a bout 4 days then started sweating profusely! I want to change it but people tell me to give it a shot! I hate the sweating part' and it helps me sleep and my appetite isn't like it was either!,1
You are definitely bipolar. Try lithium. It's the one med for bipolar that won't cause tardive dyskinesia. Maybe Klonopin! At least your reaching out!  You absolutely need a therapist.  Especially if you feel you want to hurt others. Lexapro targets major anxiety which seems to be most of what makes up bipolar. It helped my 2 family members. They still struggle but they aren't as angered. One of my family members said it helped them from feeling like they wanted to kill..Medical Marijuana needs to be not just for chronic pain but definitely passed for bipolar because of the dystonia type side affects the anti psychotic medicine for bipolar can cause.  I'm praying you get control because it's just as hard on the family and you'll want your children to grow up healthy. Normal life can be hard enough..Blessings/praying.,1
I saw my family members grow up with this disorder. It a major stuggle and was hard to communicate with them. My dad had bipolar and was an alcoholic.  He's passed on but thinking back I feel so bad that he grew up in a day and age where these problems werent protrudingly aware as they are today. I have experience horrid past events and I can tell you those problems you can get over with the right talk therapy. I also heard exercise can help. I know you posses bouts of excessive energy with BP so if you can take up walking jigging running to burn some of it off. I think one of the main things is to try an catch yourself when you go into mania. I'm not sure if you have control over that...try to just keep telling yourself it's the illness. Then maybe lift weights or jog. You definable need to control the depression part. How is your job status? Working hard with good pay does much for the self-esteem. Hang in there..,1
"You are not alone, therapy along with the right medication can help tremendously. If your psychiatrist isn't there for you, find a new one who will be. I can't imagine what stress you have gone through in your life but know that God doesn't give us more than we can handle. You are a strong man and you will find the help you need. When thinking of harming yourself remember that your kids need you. When I would have harmful thoughts I would remember my family. I can do this. You'll be in my thoughts.",1
I want to but I'm afraid they'd turn me away   claiming I'm not in a volatile state to do so.,1
If you feel there is more to it beg them for help don't leave their office until they help you you can't be expected to live like this your wife needs to get involved more in understanding your illnesses I know you feel like she's giving up on you but probably just doesn't understand maybe get some books from the library or if you don't want to go there yourself maybe buy some online maybe if she reads the effects and symptoms of these illnesses might help her help you may not realise this but knowing you have an illness and feeling like there isn't something quite right going on with you is a massive step in the right direction just keep holding on it must be so scary to feel this way and not know how you'll be from one hour to the next I've witnessed similar things as you when I was growing up and been beaten by my step dad and sexually abused that all fucks you up I understand where you're at I'm sorry for all that has happened to you and I wish you all the best mate,1
"Hi I suffer the same your background sound a bit like mine I was you not long ago my family walked on egg shells, I never meant to be the way I was I just couldn't handle or cope, until I was put on lithium it helped a lot my family started to feel more comfortable around me, so maybe you need to look at your meds,as for them understanding my husband doesn't need to understand just a hug when I'm feeling low or I just take time out and let everyone know I'm not feeling to good, tell your kids and wife the truth about how your feeling that way they know it's not them it's your illness, I tell my kids and they understand they've lived through it with me, not telling your wife and kids that when you feel the way you do and if your nasty or irrational it's not there fault you can't go through this on your own your a family and letting them in they get to know the real you and your wife and kids will be able to go through life  feeling understood, you also need to say sorry when you're being nasty or say something you shouldn't, it takes time but as family we worked it out I'm sure you can too I am also 40 and think it gets a little bit harder, I hope this has helped if you need to ask me anything you can pm me I know what it's like x",1
"How sad I was reading your post.....It was like listening to my son, who had exactly the same symptoms as you are experiencing. It took many years for him to finally find a professor of psychiatry who put him on the right meds and he is now coping much better. Don't give up on yourself, there is always a solution! I just suffer from severe depression and anxiety but understand what you are going through. Sending you hugs and blessings from South Africa!",1
"Oh your not alone at all . I'm sorry your suffering but you pretty much took this out of my brain . and there's a a few things u mentioned I will also look into . thank you for sharing <3 helps me feel not so alone . 
Yeah find a new therapist doctor whatever .
I do suggest trying marijuana and finding the right strain for you and theres also dif products that don't get u stoned if u needed to work . 
I really hope you find something and some one to help . I.know how scary and fucking frustrating it is.. 
Take care if you can't take it one day at a time.. Try to takw it hour by hour xo",1
"All else being equal with your mental health issues, something happens to a large majority of people when they approach or hit 40.  It's almost like a mid-life awakening of sorts where you start to really dive in and process some of the shit that has lead you up to this point.  I am bipolar ll, also.  Borderline Personality Disorder has come up more than once with my current psych, also.  It is what it is.  Flow with it and continue on with the process.  Try not to overthink it and don't stop until you find something that works for you.  I take Lithium, which I was told was the gold standard, first line treatment for BP2 and it works very well for me.  Take a deep breath and talk to your wife when you aren't in the midst of a crisis and ask her to take the lead for you and don't beat her (figuratively) up if you can at all avoid it.  We all need someone in our corner.  Stay the course for you and the kids.  You are not alone.",1
"PTSD sucks, they said I had it during my intake assessment but the psychiatrist dismissed it, not sure why, she asked me some trigger questions and I guess I didn't give an appropriate response although I've been plagued by being terrorized as a child. I will definitely be getting a new psychiatrist, thank you Nick.",1
"Unfortunately a lot of ppl live with that stigma    but what they don't understand is that its hard to get the help needed and deal with everyday life too. I've heard that only weak ppl go to ""crazy farms"" but personally I think that only the strongest ppl are willing to try anything to get the help they need and deserve! Financial issues will always be a problem and to that I say the risk is worth the reward and there is always bankruptcy. Finances shouldn't hold ppl back from feeling better. Good luck to you   ",1
"Sounds like a very complex set of symptoms. The thing that truly helped me was DBT therapy and mindfulness. It was very difficult for me to begin practicing consistently, but i kept at it. Its taken me 4 years of learning that essential oils calm my anxiety, a mood stabilizer and sleep meds make sure I'm getting enough sleep, staying hydrated, do my dbt worksheets and have become more patient with myself. It's not easy to change my reactions and volatile aggression but it can be done! It's a lifestyle change like any other. DBT works if you work it. Also would recommend BPD central forums and also NAMI family to family program for your adult family members. Wish you all the best!",1
Well getting in the practice of a mindful life very difficult imo esp for people who struggle w mental illness. We tend to feel out of control and over reactive so practicing staying in the present is quite challenging. Becoming a master self control is daunting. Least it was for me.,1
"I see you and I hear you and I acknowledge you. I have been on epilim and serdep for 11 years to treat my bipolar which is as severe, if not more so than you. I want to encourage you today. You are not alone my friend. I have done many things I regret, have been in jail 3 times as a result. Used drugs and been in countless fights. I'm a former Marine so violence and death does not scare me. Drugs are not the answer, however I support the use of cannabis oil 100%. I have learnt how to manage my bipolar and would be only too happy to help you if you'd like my opinion, and I say opinion for a reason because I can't take advice and instruction that well and feel the same may apply to you. Message me if you like and I'll help. Remember one thing, you are not your mind...your mind has bipolar, your soul does not...learn to live in your soul and your life will change...in my opinion.

"I want to agree with everyone that her self harm is not your fault, not now and not ever. Having said that, maybe the two of you can talk about the stressful things that make her feel the need to cut. Are there things you can work on together? Even if they are small, it can make a world of difference knowing that you are working together as a team to conquer a common enemy. For example, I have chronic pain and depression and my husband and we make
sure that we both say we are mad at the pain and the depression, not mad at me. My pain and depression are part of me, but they are not my whole self. Banding together has made us stronger because fighting these demons alone is exhausting. I would also strongly encourage you to find a couples counselor, even if you can only afford a few sessions. If you are a religious person, you could also see if your place of worship offers reduced/free counseling. Try checking out NAMI.org and find support groups in your area - you should not have to fight alone. I hope you can find the strength you need to find your own healing and to support your partner in theirs",1

"I know how hard it is to talk to people with social anxiety clouding all your thoughts, but talking to each other, and probably with a professional as well if possible, it really is the best and only answer. Try to figure our how to help each other. I would give almost anything to have another person in my life who was similar, don't let yourself get further away.",1
I have PTSD chronic depression anxiety and bipolar your symptoms qualifie you for social security disability I'm on it took me a year to get you need a disability lawyer otherwise you will never get it,1
What does your comment mean? I am so confused! Lol ~Dani,1
Effexor is terrible with withdraw and actually made me want to kill myself. If its working for you just give it time. I'm always tired and I'm on Zoloft its better than having panic attacks.,1
"I took effexor for years. It helped me a great deal... though I was always super tired and I gained quite a bit of weight on it. I was afraid to go off it after hearing about side effects, but I really didn't have any trouble at all. My Dr. Weaned me properly. If this med works for you... stick with it for a while.",1
"Totally Heather Hrejsa it was awful. I think my body finally decided I just didn't need it and it was really messing with me. I definitely have bad days but I can manage and deal which is great. I'm back to the old me although I need adivan to help my anxiety other then that I'm pill free
I can feel things and not feel like I'm trapped in my ""movie mind"" lol if that makes sense",1
Effexor made me more depressed as well. It was horrible.,1
Me too. I'm scared to get off it if I ever do,1
"I did miss a a dose once and it was horrible, I could handle it to an extent. My doctor tries to help me but sometimes I think she's tired of trying especially since I'm still suffering a lot from things like lack of good quality sleep, extreme fatigue even though my moods are more stable. She said once my moods were more stable the rest would get better and it's not.",1
"Seroquel gave me horrible reactions! Along with a 25# weight gain, puffiness and an attempt at suicide.... I opted out!",1
Did it upset your stomach?,1
"I'm on 375mg daily, I think it helps, to scared to stop and try otherwise as my bones literally start hurting and I get electric shocks if it's missed",1
"If it ain't broke... Don't fix it.  Changing psych meds can be life altering; and, in some cases life threatening.  When disclosing your medication regimen to others, you will receive all kinds of ""advice""... Even from professionals.  Do your own research on FDA warnings for your meds.  Avoid ""word on the street"" advice.  Most importantly... Listen to your own body and mind.",1
"I've never been on celexa but effexor does wonders for me. Only thing is how horrible I feel when I skip a dose, I'm afraid coming off it will be hard",1
Oh no! That scares the fuck out of me. I'm so sorry u had to go thru that. Paxil gave me the brain zaps really bad,1
"It's a horrible drug to come off, even when weaning.  I tried for a few months before Christmas last and even weaning properly, my head was still getting brain zaps 5 months later.  Back on it now 'cus the world got 'too real' without it.  Good depression drug to numb feelings and help you handle the world, but a fucking nightmare to try and come off.",1
"Jenn, if I may ask, did Cymbalta put on weight or is it still too soon to tell. Im ready to give meds another shot out of desperation. I have a bit of a problem dealing with weight gain, some say I have an eating disorder. Once I start packing the weight on I automatically quit the med. Sounds petty, but it is just me.",1
"I have severe adhd, ptsd, depression, and anxiety plus a dissociative disorder. So finding a drug that works is hard. I just take hydroxizine now. I'm pregnant. So after baby comes, I'll try things again. Effexor, never again. Tripped me out",1
"Send him out to work that will take some of the stress, if that does not (work) give him a few strong whiskeys that would do the trick.      ",1
The first step is to make sure he's not using drugs or alcohol because that's not helpful at all when you have depression and try to commit suicide a lot of people do that because they using narcotics or drinking alcohol the thing is sometimes people don't say whether they coming from it will be easy I think like for me to let you know where you can get help because I don't even know where are people location cuz I'm in New York City right now don't give up I can't stop writing you about my life because what will never finish trust me I taking care of my daughter we bipolar disorder my son we bipolar autism as Bergen ADHD and more and more diagnosis and myself we bipolar PTSD anxiety depression fibromyalgia what else do you want you want me to continue telling you my diagnosis trust me sweetie I'm not going to give up and no diagnosis I got days I don't want to leave but I realize the only person can take my life as God you strong woman you doing the right thing and I know in this page will be the right person to conduct yourself why you guys got to do as a family but never feel guilty what you write make me feel even cry because I know you have to be a wonderful woman that's what he pick you and look he's bad days you are there for him just continued prayers to God God bless you and I hope everything goes well for you and your family,1
This may sound a little off beat and I may not be right but I know from personal experience of having done suicide attempts I never told anybody about it I just did it unsuccessfully I might add because I'm still here at least he's telling you when he feels that way which is normally a cry for help maybe they need to try different medications it's hard to be a guinea pig and find the right ones is he interested in counseling or group therapy do you.  have enough influence on him to get him to try these things. Maybe even suggest to him that he was not able to stay strong for himself at least try to stay strong for his children because if he actually did try to commit suicide and died just not he that he's hurting it's the whole family and I bet you that your children would never be able get over an event like that. Sometimes even children feel guilty and think that it's their fault because of what their parent has done your children need to be spared from those feelings try and see if you can get him reengage with some talk therapy and be positive that they can find a medication that works for him,1
"Please be very careful... Suicidality and homicidality often coexist simultaneously in someone who is moving in and out of psychosis.  The threat of suicide can also be a manipulative technique to prevent you from fleeing for safety with your children.  That doesn't mean his threat of suicide is an empty threat.  But, no one can begin healing with the fear of death lingering over head.  If your gut tells you to leave... Then leave.  I am not speaking in judgment, but from extensive experience... Not just with myself, but in almost every relationship in my family.  Please... Follow your motherly instinct over your desire to be his wife.",1
"I know it's a completely different situation but this response is more geared towards you. My late husband fought cancer for 2 years before he lost. We had 2 boys already, 10 & 6 and had just found out a week after he had his diagnosis that I was pregnant with our rainbow baby. About 8 months before he passed he told me he was ready to go and that was truly the hardest thing I've ever heard. That doesn't even describe it. I actually got really upset with him because I couldn't understand why he would just give up fighting for us like that. I finally understand what he was trying to tell me but I promise you those words still haunt me today. If I had any advice for someone that's heard this same thing from someone they love, it's for you.. yourself, go talk to a Dr or in my case Dr and social worker therapist, asap. Also try to lean on your personal support system more than I did. And just remember to breathe.. as for him, I absolutely agree with what was said above about getting him to a hospital so they can get him feeling better. There is ABSOLUTELY NO shame in having to do that!!!! Mental illnesses are just as real as things like heart disease and diabetes! I hope some part of this helped. My heart  and prayers sincerely go out to you and your family. If you ever feel like talking please please friend and then message me so I'll see it right away!",1
Look up Saphris i take 10mg daily for harmful thoughts i also take geodon 80mg for bipolar and artain for side effects it's a lot but I've been sick for 35 year's and this is the best i can do and i still struggle so on those days i smoke weed to help slow down my thinking where i can control myself,1
"You need to see a new doctor, I have bipolar and struggled really bad but am coping with appropriate meds, and extra support, definitely seek medical help urgently because sometimes thoughts and what others think are just threats can turn into suicide without any hesitation, as horrible as it sounds some people find that it's their only chance of being free from it all, I've lost 4 friends from suicide and none of them even showed symptoms of depression it is a very well hidden illness that can be treated to be manageable, xxxx",1
There is no shame in going back to the hospital. If your family screams... Scream back louder until they hear you... Sending hugs n prayers,1
At least you have your family they scream at you I'm alone with 2 kids my daughter is an adult and my son is 11 struggling we autism right now he's in the hospital my daughter wants the same way and wasn't real easier for me but look I made because I start speak up and tell people would ever win the city said they got help I need the help that the city offer and they will help you I have couple hospital I live in the Bronx New York not even if I was crazy I will leave my son over here so what I do I travel to Manhattan New York and we got to help with this serve as a human being sweetie it's always positive if you leave far away in town you don't get the help you don't have to tell you family feud adult get a train get a bus and go to another town that you can get the help that you deserve because anywhere they have to treat you the right way and then if you wanted to get in contact with your family you put them in the list so they can called you but you have to let me know where you are at to see if you location will help me more to help you,1
"Please go to the hospital. You are important & if your family doesn't get that then you need to distance yourself from there toxic attitudes. I did it & it has helped me alot. I have OCD, depression, social phobia & anxiety. Please do it for you. Good luck",1
I don't know how old you are. But your dx changes as you get up there. I have so many issues but the dire ones complete anxiety or disassiotion. Depression crippling as it is. Your left with so many issues but luckily the panic and deep depression seems to let up. But seriously you need a Dr to give much needed meds (I can't stress this) someone needs to look out of the box everyone you know is IN the house. I'm medicated which such a dx is a must because of chemical imbalance. But I was raped tortured by my brother and 1ST HUSBAND. I HAD A TWIN SISTER WHO KILLED HERSELF LEAVEING ME TO RAISE HER TWIN BABIES. What I'm getting at you can get though anything just try really try to look out of the box. You have a life there too,1
"In all honesty. You truly need to check in to a hospital. Take care of yourself and dont worry about your family yelling at you. You can tell someone at the hospital, how you're treated by your family. It may be considered abuse for the way they treat you. Also. You might want to look into disability for your illness.",1
Get help hun. Try not to stress and tackle one thing at a time or you will be overwhelmed.,1
"I know you don't want to, but going to the hospital may be your best bet. You are more important than your family's views. Don't worry about them yelling at you. You can ask the hospital to not allow them to visit you. You do what you need to, even if it's against the wishes of the family. You're loved, and you will get through this.     ",1
"What about S.S.D.I.? (Or is it S.S.I.? lol, I can't remember.)I don't know if I can help because I also have bad anxiety and Depression as well as Social Phobia, PTSD and other issues that I honestly can't even remember because my brain just won't work right. However, I did try starting a group on Facebook, and eventually all over the place, for people who couldn't get the right help from doctors...or worse, get abused by doctors because of our disabilities. I just started it recently and I have a lot more work to do (and a ton of ideas) but I can't sit by and let this continue. We deserve to be happy and healthy too! The only issue is that it is extremely difficult to form a group of people, when that's my biggest fear...but that's also part of what motivates me. I've been a prisoner to my own mind for way too long, and I've let almost everyone take advantage of my brain not allowing me to say what I really mean, or need to; like ""No"" or ""I can't do that"". Sorry if this is too long, I just really want to help, not only you and anyone else, but also myself. I will try and find out more information if you want me to and I'm also still trying to get more people aware of the horrific health system so we can get some real help.",1
"Oh gosh honey you are differently going thru alot 
 Why not try to get ssi? I was also a self harmer many years ago. I know when I got overwhelmed it did help but there are many other things you can do. The only think that helped me.  When I was anorexic it was all about control over  never ending feeling. You can do this for you and no one else
 If you need to go to the hospital then go and if intakes your family that's to bad. I can definitely understand where you come from with your family. Keep your head yo and God bless you",1
"I agree with Lynn. All we have is our health. That is a basic human need and without good health, we have nothing. Other things in life may need to be put on hold like your schooling. You can't be the best student unless you feel mentally stable. 

I've been where you're at. I lost my job because of my mental illness. I had legal troubles. I reached rock bottom when my husband asked for a divorce and told me I was too unstable to see my children. At the time, I balked at him assuming I was inadequate as a parent. I realize now that my judgement was clouded because of my illness. It took me a year to gain an inkling of trust back with him. Here I am, 5 years later and the happiest I've been in 15 years. 

This road is hard. You need the support of family, friends and medical professionals. I hope and pray you find that. ❤️",1
"Right on! I feel it isn't doing me any good, I was taking Cymbalta but they weened me off and it was horrible. I will be talking with my psychiatrist next Friday, maybe I can try Lamotigen & Latuda with Cymbalta. I just worry about the negative effects of weight gain from the combination of meds.",1
I have those same behaviors with my bipolar PTSD and panic disorder you're not alone each day is new maybe push yourself beyond your limits and not in your comfort zone to do things to help make yourself feel better baby steps small baby steps,1
"This could not be truer, I so badly want to run away but how do you run away from your own mind.  Mental illness sucks, every hour of every day is a battle. You know life isn't that bad,  you want to be happy but it just don't happen that way so you get aggregated at yourself.  You know others have it worse so you feel selfish to feel the way you do.  Therefore guilt starts building. I just want to scream,  I want to be normal,  I want a break.  So I look at the day hour by hour just to make it through and tell myself everything is fine,  I'm just tired. If you are struggling with mental illness I want to say keep trying and you are so much stronger than you give yourself credit for.",1
"So sad, and yet so true.  I am alone in my struggles.",1
I get that this is How people feel (I suffer from panic disorder/agoraphobia so I don't have bipolar but similar issues. I have a close friend who suffers from bipolar and I know she is on this page. Some of these posts I feel need to be more uplifting and not so negative. Yes its the truth how bipolar minds work and I want everyone to understand how mental illness feels but this post in particular just bugs me. Some people who see this may depress them more. I dont want my friend thinking there is no hope for her. More uplifting stuff PLEASE.,1
Yeah I get that. True. I know what its like to feel alone and knowing that I'm not is certainly helpful. Just some are a bit much. But it also comes from fear of having a loved one take it wrong. Guess ya cant win. Mental illness just sucks. But i get what your saying as well,1
Yet we feel guilty for what we are feeling,1
"I suffer from severe anxiety can't leave the house most days, depression;  negative thoughts overwhelm me. I self medicated while on my prescription meds with weed and perks and I actually feel good..happy energetic. ..but doc won't give me them..",1

"I have bipolar 1, borderline personality disorder and generalized anxiety disorder... I have two kiddos 7 yrs and 19 months. I understand as they are the reasons that I am still alive. I lost my job of 5 years due to a manic episode where I lost all rational... I have had a hard time digging myself out",1
"I just keep telling myself ""I will come back"" I have rapid cycling bipolar 2. That for years and years has been untreated as its polar extremes where not so damaging. I could fit in and survive without anyone really knowing. All those years I got to know myself and my disorder. Then just over three months ago, bam. My depressive episode came and stayed. It is darker and more destructive than anything I had felt before. All of my worst days were not in fact my worst. I can at times by not sleeping, eating and taking un prescribed med induce a high/mania. But hell if I thought my new low pole was bad....my new high is just scary. So iv reached out and am now properly medicated. Almost a month on medication now. No real change yet but no ones got the phone in hand calling the white bus so I think I must be doing okay. My disorder has changed instantly. For what appears to be no reason. I think my rapid cycling days are over. I'm in for long standing mood shifts that stay like seasons. All the time I disliked my disorder I now want it back. We are still here underneath all the cloudy turmoil on the surface, you will come back. We need to conserve the energy for calmer waters and then swim fast when we are able. Not doing anything doesn't feel right I know, and waiting for everyone else to catch up when you have asked for help is just crushing. Hang in there. You will come back. I feel that if I give up now going through these real bad times then all the other times I survived become worthless. I thought they were the nightmare. They were not. Maybe this isn't either. I am a soul inside a body with a mind that doesn't function properly. I am here. I will come back to the surface just as soon as I can. So can you. If you can pick up a pen, write...write it all. Though dont read it back, always a trigger. Keep it safe till your better able to understand it. Take something from it all later. If all it does is get it out and onto paper that's ok. If you can share it with your closest friend, Ask them to quietly write back. Find little ways to reach out when you can. You have survived so much already fellow warrior do not despair! You will be back. x",1
"Perhaps Celexa and a hormone replacement would help 
Just a suggestion but it has helped. Too often women have major hormone issues that contribute to depression, anxiety and insomnia. Just a suggestion",1
I am sorry to here that i take it for anxiety and depression and hot flashes I take 150 mg a day,1
There is nothing wrong with Effexor. My daughter takes it and it has totally changed her life for the better. She used to have such social anxiety. The one thing about antidepressants and mood stabilizers is that they don't work on everyone the same way. I have been on many different ones over the years. I have taken Viibryd for the last 2 years and my doctor just added cymbalta. I don't think that is the correct spelling...,1
"The moods are fairly stable compared to usual it's the overwhelming amount of fatigue that I'm dealing with, my memory isn't great anymore, and of course the pain.",1
My doctor had given me time that haven't worked and the Effexor was prescribed by a different doctor since I was so desperate.... I've select years upon years trying to get better and finding a good doctor is just as bad.,1
I love cymbalta I'm still on 30mgs was supposed to bump up to 60 mg but since I moved out of state (from the state where Dr gave me the script) I haven't been able to bump up and I'm sort of worried to cause I'm only 114lbs and don't wanna end up overdosed,1
It's without a doubt one of the better ones I've had. Been on it since 2008 and found it very effective,1
Works well for me only side effect I've had is that it makes me drowsy otherwise it's kicked my anxiety and depression in the balls,1
I had terrible experiences with it. It caused extreme anxiety and brain zaps. I could not tolerate it and Withdrawal was hell too but everyone reacts differently.,1
Very effective with anxiety,1
Horrible side effects and almost impossible to come off/- find an alternative if possible,1
This is the only medication I have been able to take. I've only been on it 2 weeks and already noticed massive improvement with my anxiety and I haven't cried once. No nasty side effects neither! I can eat and i am now able to sleep at night without sleeping pills. It's helped me so much,1
"No I have never tried it but I'd love to know if it works for you. I am suffering with no medication and desperately looking for a support group here in Tampa, so if anyone knows of a doctor or specialist I can see on a sliding scale maybe? I don't have insurance so any advice would be helpful...tyty :D",1
"I was in the trial studies years back. I noticed a change.... couldnt really pin point what that change was but thought it was better than nothing. After continuing for another 4 or 5 years, I had to come off of it. That was truly the most horrible experience of my life. It was worse than coming off of opiates. 
    After a few weeks i had to check myself in the hospital for suicidal thoughts(intense thoughts). My mood was vicious angry and unpredictable. 
     Be very careful taking this drug and even more so when you have to come off of it. There are side effects that they have not put on the label and withdraws are one of them.",1
Im on it... its been more than a month now and it seems to be working... my anxiety levels have been reduced... im also taking serotia for mood stabilization and depression...ü,1
Dont panic its organic! Hhoo...     ,1
my wife was on it and it made her brain shake and the brain zaps were horrible  and then getting off cymbalta she had discontinuation syndrome,1
I was feeling hopeless too for quite some time and couldn't get my severe panic and agoraphobia under control. Finally found a med combo that works. I still have a journey ahead of me but I'm doing much better. You will find that too. You just have to keep trying different meds. And therapy. Don't know you or your situation but I believe there's hope for us all.,1
I love cymbalta been on it a while now but suppose to be taken off all my psych meds in the next coming months as my partner and I are going to be trying to become pregnant and worried about the withdrawal,1
It destroyed my appetite for the first month or so. Otherwise I've had no side effects and it seems to be helping. I'm back to enjoying little things in life and my hobbies. I don't know about it's effect on anxiety bc I take other stuff for that. Also I have less back pain which the doctor said could be from this medicine. The downside I guess is that if I forget a dose then I start to feel very uncomfortable about 12 hours after the missed dose. It feels like electric currents are discharging in my head and face. But I've had this happen with several antidepressants. I've been on antidepressants since I had an eating disorder in high school over ten years ago and this medicine seems to be the best yet or at least a close second. Pristiq was good too but sooooooo expensive. If your insurance isn't great then check the good rx website. They have like coupons and stuff for all sorts of meds.,1
"Ya I was thrilled. Then I went thru a personal rough patch where I was hungry again. Now I'm awake after midnight, been up since 8 am, haven't eaten anything all day and if I wasn't worried about getting ill, I could probably go to sleep without eating all day. But that's not healthy. Make sure to have balanced snacks even if you aren't hungry bc your body needs it to stay strong.",1
"I have also the start up 
Have big crasch :(:( and i must also zeprexa.  I am so afraid.     Normaly i can not taken ant depression pills 
Dont understand life whit anxiery all the time :(:(",1
"My mom has been on antidepressants and anxiety medication for nearly 25yrs now. For so long it seemed nothing would work. She's now on Cymbalta  and rexulti and is a completely different person! In a good way! 
Everybody is different and will react differently to  certain medication. Take it as prescribed and IF you notice any side effects, call your doctor immediately! They are Not going to give you something if they don't think it'll work for you and your diagnosis. Best of luck to you!",1
Gail DeShong  It felt like a weird panic attack all the time. Nothing visible but inside it felt horrible. It got to the point that I couldn't function because it was so distracting and brought me to psychosis,1
"As already stated, it can be hard to come off of it. It's probably good you're increasing dosage gradually. As already mentioned, the withdrawal can be awful. Also, please carefully read all of the side effects. If you have some of the scarier side effects happen, please have a supportive friend or family member on speed dial. You might also consider healthy snacks like chocolate covered nuts if you're not allergic. These may help a little with mood, but are not a substitute for medication. Dosage modification should be done by the doctor, with all of your experience with the medication disclosed.",1
"Been on it a couple of years. Withdraws is huge! I got VERY suicidal and felt terrible, paranoid etc. it's worked ok for me I still have difficulty during hormonal time.",1
Mood stabilizer (lamitical.) is the bipolar med. ...cymblta wellbturin Prozac are all antidepressants  ..manic depression.. anxiety,1
Absolutely horrible spent nearly a month in bed. Worst medication I ve ever been on - nearly killed me!!!,1
Oh really :( that's terrible and scary,1
It was the only med that helped for my depression anxiety and chronic pain but I had to come off due to jaundice.,1
Good for depression hard to come off of side of effects of stopping are horrible,1
"A guy at work really likes me but I'm petrified to ""let him in.""
I've told him that I don't want to be in a relationship but he won't give up!
I push people away.",1
"I gave up, many times too. But even so, I never truly stopped caring. I have social phobia and general anxiety disorder, among a few other problems but they aren't nearly as bad as the social phobia. I can't get help from the right people because I can't express myself the way I want to; like I can't tell somone what the problem is. I can't even get to the point of talking to someone...but I had an idea that changed my outlook (even though it's still eating away at me, it will get better). I decided that I'm going to start recording myself most of the time, and start a YouTube channel. It will give me a way to push through the anxiety, on my own terms, and at my own pace. It does give me hope, and even if it fails, it will still have helped a lot. But one of the biggest issues is that I keep getting stuck on starting anything. I always feel the need to be pushed in a direction so I can know what I'm supposed to be doing. I hold myself back by not just going for it. So this is me going for it lol. I appologize to all the people that keep having to read my long posts...and that's not a joke, I really don't know if it's my anxiety or not but I feel like I'm the only one who talks this much on Facebook, maybe even the whole internet lol. (Okay, maybe it was partially a joke) I'll shut up now.",1
"Summat Dewberry  Praying doesn't do anything. Magic isn't real. Stop acting like doing nothing is helping people. I'm ashamed I have to explain that to you. I hope you're a child. Santa, Unicorns and the Easter Bunny are not real either. Sorry.",1
Yes. Because what happened becomes amplified in my sleep. So what was already hell turns into horror.,1
"Healing must take place on all three planes of your existence: spiritual, psychological, & physical.  Pray specifically about your BPD... Your symptoms, your fears, give thanks for triumphs.  There is power in Jesus' name.  Also, develop daily routines. There is some comfort in sameness.  Routines also help you guage the severity of downshifts towards bouts of depression, anxiety attacks, or the onset of a psychosis.  Strictly care for youe body.  Vitamin deficiencies can prompt the onset of depressive episodes and angry outbursts.  Study, study, study yoursrlf... Your past, your present, your habits & all the ""why's"" of your life.  I am praying for you now.",1
My last episode had mixed psychotic features which really scared me....,1
"Talk therapy, DBT, life balance classes, all of these are great. The more you understand your disorders, the better. Also remember you're not alone here, this group also has been a great help to me, talking with people with the same disorders and knowing how they manage it. 
Don't expect medication (if prescribed) to work right away. Sometimes it doesn't work and another would have to be tried. Everybody is different so medications would be trial and error until a combo work perfectly for you. 
I myself am currently on celexa, but it only helps me with the anxiety. Not the depression. I'm supposed to be taking a mood stabilizer but I cannot afford it right now without a job. 
Again, remember you're not alone in this.",1

With time it will pass as you slowly get back into the positive aspects of your day to day life style. Don't put too much pressure on yourself your only home take your time, try to get some fresh air each day it's very easy to fall into a pattern of withdrawing from life due to the anxiety personally I wish you well just don't put pressure on yourself immediately baby steps work okay regards...",1
Have felt the same.Scared of my own shadow.Is there anyone who could stay with you until you've found your feet again?,1
"Perfectly normal!  When i would spend stays in the hospital and then get released, i would do a bit of nesting. Make one room my comfort area. Start slow and and let my living space grow. Dont overwhelm yourself",1
Being scared is totally normal. It's because you don't have the safety and security of others around.. Both professional and other patients on the unit,1
"Its ok to feel scared, your starting over being home which is a great thing. you have opportunities to do what you want when you want. Its all in timing, you have time to do things at your own pace. Every step counts for something. I wish you all the best",1
I was absolutely petrified after being in the hospital a month. Just take it slow it gets better but every day is a victory!! Good luck you can do it!!,1
After a week being I am scared to be home or going out anywhere. I suffer from the same things you do. I can't handle being in any store unless my husband is right by me or I will freak out.,1
Any change effects us. So you should know going home and being afraid is normal!,1
I think it will only b natural to be at least a little bit scared I know I was it is just getting used to 'the outside world' again it will take time but it will fade if it gets too much u can always reach out to the local crisis team for help don't b scared to do that also remember it can only get better ur not alone  x x,1
Is it scary to be alone yes make a extreme effort.   If you mzke neigh ors where u r they can check on u and u them we all meed help,1
I felt the same way after my discharge. I was disoriented and not sure of myself. It will pass. I did HOP/IOP afterward and it helped. You can always call the crisis line if you need to talk to someone to help when its overwhelming.,1
I am sometimes scared still even though I've never been to a psych ward. I have all that you have. I use to give myself panic attacks to the point I couldn't stay home alone. It helps if you use lavender oils to breathe in for anxiety. It also helps to talk to friends during the time you are scared. I'm available to talk when you need a friend. I beat the panic attacks but when my husband leaves sometimes it's hard. I also ended up getting a dog to help. But if you need a friend add me and talk with me. I'm here.,1
I don't know if you like animals the right now they offering and different states animal for companion I think that's the name they call and if you like animals that would be a good company for you but remember one thing the dog is going to be your company but you also got to taking care of the dog really well and I have a puppy right now and I don't feel alone anymore I used to feel like without people I can leave and now I do not want people around me anymore because I don't like noise it gets me very irritated when people being very loud around me or they arguing and I'm feeling better I don't miss no one,1
"It most definitely is normal, if you have medication to take it regularly as prescribed, the fear should subside.",1
This was my question thank you all for being respectful to my question. I was in the psyc ward for being suicidal.  I hope that this scared feeling goes away soon . I can't handle being scared to be by myself.  It feels so overwhelming. .,1
I have no one to stay with me. Im scared for myself,1
I was scared to be alone after I came out of the ward too. I stayed with a friend the first two nights.,1
I got a dog shes a big help but i just cant fight this feeling. Its overwhelming feels like im going to have a panic attack,1
It is completely understandable. You were not alone for a full month. Have you tried maybe getting a pet? They are therapeutic and can start to recognize your anxiety/highs/lows. Good luck and you can do this!,1
Thank you for letting me know that im not alone .. I don't know how to act.. I feel like im going backwards this is so scary for me .. Feels like im losing my grip.,1
Of course you're scared. So much has happened in the last few weeks and days. You can pm me if you want....,1
"I was scared of everything, really.Everything seemed different, like I was seeing it for the 1st time....it gets better.  Good Luck",1
When your ready to be on your own you'll know. If your scared it may not be the right time to come home. I've spent several times in the hospital when the medicine and mind set is good then your ready.,1
"Being scared is totally ok to be feeling. Even though being in a psch ward is hard, you know you are going to be safe. Being out on your own, brings a full list of emotions that you need to try and manage. Take it hour by hour and when you get through each hour, you are coping and achieving. Be kind to yourself. Take baby steps. Try and get help and support from those you can trust when you need it and keep telling yourself ""i can do this"". We are all so brave to be fighting our battles everyday. We have to believe we can do this. Sending hugs. Xx",1
This is not all the time but when my anxiety is really bad I will turn the TV right down to still an audible level but a very quiet level as I can't try to get calm if its too loud.,1
"I am super sensitive to noses too. I get irritated very easily to any kinds of noise. I never really thought to tell my dr though. I'm on so many meds I'm not sure they could help w this. I have no polar, and anxiety disorder. They might just tell me to get over it. Lol but for real noise is a huge trigger for me! I snap out!",1
"Can I just say that alcohol is the worst thing for anxiety and depression.  You're not self medicating, you're destroying yourself further.  Not only should alcohol not be consumed with the drugs you're on, but it's also a depressant and can raise anxiety levels, especially in the hangover period.  This is probably why you don't think your meds are working.",1
"I have 4 kids and I can not handle loud noises at all I have to near silence to concentrate on the task or question at hand.  PTSD, BI-Polar II Rapid Cycling, Anxiety,  OCD, ....",1
"Loud tv gives me huge anxiety, especially 
when the ads come on, and someone tries to talk as well. It caused so much stress, I hardly ever have it on. It's like my brain can't cope with it",1
Try and cut out the alcohol if you can it doesn't mix well w meds. I personally can't smoke either sends my anxiety through the roof . Loud sounds send me up the wall especially mixed w other noises. I stay clean and just take meds therapy DBT also exercise.  I need to eat healthier. Hang in there it gets better.,1
"Well, u still shouldn't worry. 
Maybe, she just needs a bit of a break. 
It's very hard on them too. 
Having us to deal with, lol. 
We are NOT, easy people to be around. Especially when we're ill. Tx",1
"U need to ease up on yourself. 
With everything u been through that I've just read. U are doing amazing well. 
You're still working. Something I've not been able to go back to. And you're taking positive steps, as in, going out. Whether you're sat on your own or not. That's a brave and courageous thing to do. Again, something I couldn't do. 
U need to give yourself more credit for the things u ARE doing, and try not to focus on the things that you're not.
As for friends!!! I understand only too well how gutting it is when your circle gets smaller and smaller. 
But we need to understand how they feel being around us, especially when we're not doing too well. 
My friend told me that she was scared at times of my behaviour,  and that she found it really really difficult to deal with. 
She couldn't cope seeing me like that. 
And I do get it. I was terrified at times over how I was, how I behaved, how I couldn't function whatsoever, and how I was emotionally and mentally. That being a complete wreck!!!
So I can imagine how she must of felt. I wasn't me at that time. I was a nightmare to be around. I laughed one minute, babbled rubbish at a million miles an hour the next. Making no sense at all. I ran round like a loonatic cleaning etc. Then the next thing. I could be crying, sobbing, screaming, and wanting to kill myself. 
Yes, we have a daily battle with ourselves. Sometimes, just to get out of bed. But we also have to look at, how difficult it is for our friends and family to deal and cope with us. 
Wishing u well. Tx",1
Find some support groups so you can be around people that can help without depending so much on your friends. It sounds like you might be straining your relationships because you depend too much on them. Keep going you can do this!!,1
"Sometimes friends get overwhelmed when you depend upon them too much. 

All the advice given here is very good. Do not be afraid of the doctors or therapists. You just need to take the time to talk to them. Plus group therapy might also help. 

You might also want to stop going to a bar where it makes you feel more lonely. Think about other places that you might like to try. I went to a library and just read a book. There were lots of people around me but it felt ok and safe.",1
Doctors help with a lot and so do friends. I know it feels as if everyone has deserted you and I have been there. But through different support groups I've found the best friends a girl could ask for. I had an ex husband and it took me almost 5 years to remarry bc I was scared of men too. However I got lucky. ADHD is hard to deal with. I was diagnosed when I was 21. I had a hard time adjusting but things got worse. Now I am on different meds to help. I overthink about everything and it sucks. I haven't figured out how to stop but I do have friends and my husband to help. I have been in your shoes and don't be afraid. Counseling helps a lot. You just have to find the right therapist and the right program. Also lavender oils do help with stress. I would recommend that. I burn candles and wear a necklace. I hope that helps.,1
"Don't be afraid of the doctor. And a therapist can teach you tools to function more socially which will in turn positively affect your overall mood. 

Good luck, a lot of us truly understand... stick around, use us.",1
"It's ultimately your choice but personally it's the best choice I have ever made. It took a while to get the right combo and the right doses but I have been doing great now for about 2 years. Still have some good d aha and bad days but no where near what they used to be!!! I can tolerate it and I like to say ""pull it together""  when I need to. It will always be a struggle but the meds made things so so much better for me. I see things so much clearer now.",1
I also struggle with bipolar II disorder and depression and anxiety. I am on abilify and clonazepan and trust me I am so much better on medication and without it. When I was on the wrong dose I would have really far spread highs and lows but they would last a long time and now I'm at a happy medium. I still have highs and lows but everyone does. Not to mention the fact that I am a woman and hormones play a huge part in my imbalances. Hope this helps.,1
I have bipolar one ADHD and anxiety,1
"I was diagnosed with bipolar II about a year ago. I have been on meds since I was a teenager but I have  never been on the right combo of meds. My psychiatrist is in the process of switching up my meds right now. I am thankful that I have been able to be on medication. I had such horrible depression, anxiety, mania, and anger before medications. It is totally worth it to be on the right meds! The only downside is finding the right combination of meds. It takes 2-3 months for the meds to kick in completely. Hope you can get the right combo of meds!",1
"I am on medication for bipolar 1. You may start to feel a mood change. Like you are happy one minute and 60 sec later you are angry with the world. I don't have really hypermania but I am very depressed with severe anxiety. I take clonazepam,  lamicital, Sertraline, and trazodone. It helps a lot. I am trying to get the right doses. My mood is the biggest. Lamictal helps with that. However, with counseling and learning to cope with our medication helps a lot. But i know several ppl who are on medication for bipolar. Hope that helps.",1
My opinion you should have speak to your doctor but a lot of people with weed the same diagnosis they take medication because the way you feel I think you got to start with a small dose don't get panic all medication has side effect especially psychiatric medication you can lusso gain weight you have to first do you research whatever the doctor wants to prescribe you because that was my problem I didn't know I was supposed to do my research be careful a lot of the medicine they can give you you even diabetic I didn't know why I feel that way that I only want to crave sugar and fat food in Greece food but a lot have to be with the medication you have to do a research because it's not easy don't get scare at the end of the day we need to get help we got to be responsible not like older they know what they have and they don't look for help so try to be comfortable with your doctor and your therapist if you need both and do you research and try your medication with a small amount of those also so you don't say that satisfied will be really bad like I used to it little by little step by step if I don't work for you it's going to take time but one day you will get the right one good luck and God bless,1
"I refused to take meds for BP2 and anxiety until about two yrs ago. I had finally gotten to a point that I couldn't move from my bed, I couldn't leave the house, I couldn't take care of my children. It took a bit to get my meds right, I've never felt so good. I'm finally mellow and and my thoughts are not racing everywhere. I still have the anxiety and am learning better to cope with that, but my moods have finally leveled out and I can enjoy life and the small things so much more. I wish I had started these years earlier, I feel like I missed so much of life.",1
Meds DBT family support therapy might take a while to find the right meds . As time changes you might be able to take less. And during rough times more. I have bipolar 1 anxiety depression Ptsd and chronic illness ADHD.  I take 5 different ones and I'm still changing the doses . But I'm doing good took a while hang in there. Good luck.,1
"I did not realize I was BP II until age 40, when full blown hypomania hit me. I need mood stablizers for hypomania and anti-depressant for anxiety...but I have gotten my life back and may be even become a nicer person in that I am no longer doing mental and emotional gymnastic just do ordinary things...in the end, if you need meds, they will likely improve your quality of life.",1
"I take Seroquel and Viibryd prescribed by a psychiatrist. Seroquel is a mood stabilizer and antipsychotic. Viibryd is an antidepressant. My depressions are debilitating. I feel both meds have helped me a lot, but I still have problems dealing with stress. I take klonopin as needed. I just stay home a lot. I can't deal with people. I also see a talk therapist. I feel it helps a lot too.",1
"If you do start meds, pay close attention to the changes it makes. I was given an anti depressant and my manic spiked so bad it almost ruined my life. A different anti depressant they put me on put me through worse depression and I'm still recovering from the sour effects. That second one made me more suicidal. The third med they put me on was venlafaxine  (I think that's how you spell it) that one helped me more than the others but eventually my husband and I learned how to cope with my anxiety, depression and bipolar. 
The most important thing is having a good support system. I honestly don't think if be here today without my sister, mom, and husband.",1
"I have been on meds for 5 years. They were helpful to get to know myself while I had stress going on in my life which I couldn't control. I've extensively researched & am now weaning of meds to eventually go med-free & control with exercise, diet
& meditation. 
I'm going to give it 6 months to wean slowly because I take 3 sorts of meds. Antidepressant, antipsychotic for sleep & mood stabiliser.",1
"Richie Ingles the less packages and preservatives the better. Fresh veggies. 
But routine is huge! I have to set my alarm to remind me to get ready for bed. Sleep is so important for my moods.",1
"I also have BP2 and anxiety. I choose to medicate. My depressive episodes get so bad, it is my only choice if I want to be some semblance of ""well"". It has taken me a long time to find the right combination of meds but I feel for me it is the best choice. I just started going to therapy again too, and that has helped immensely.",1
I Have Bi polar and The best decision I've made is to take the pills they help control the raging fire inside. But I don't have Anxiety or sddepression so the meds might not work as well or even make it worse.,1
"The 2 best things I ever did once diagnosed, was to quit drinking and start on meds. It took alittle while to find the right combination, stick with it.Go to a therapist regularly also.Almost 3 yrs later,and I no longer have to take anxiety meds I, or meds to sleep.I take lithium and wellbutrin. I still have symptoms but the severity is less.",1
I need medication to feel good otherwise my brain is a scary place to be.,1
"I have Bipolar 2 and ADHD, I struggled along most of my life with nothing until 8 years ago. Then I was put on the right medication and it has helped me so very much.",1
all of this is sad but true..i live it everyday!! my son dont get why i cant get up out of my room and go shopping or anything else for that matter..when i come to my room life just stops for me...like i cant cant get out...help!!! how do u just get up and go...my life all changed in 2000 and again last yr..so much death in my life..my biggest fear is the fear of death!! the worst!!,1
"I know what you mean exactly. I figured out that if I learn as much as I can, the better I can explain to friends/other support what i want them to know..you probably know a lot..its pretty difficult to explain it to someone tho. Some days I'm so anxious, I don't know what to say..to anyone...let alone explain this!! Read things, articles..whatever you find helpful for yourself and maybe refer them strait to that.",1
I understand but then again the people who understand are literally so few and far between and they only understand to THEIR best ability. I hear you and you're not alone. It's a tug of war struggle.,1
"You are definitely not alone! I have an excellent support system, but have people who have a hard time accepting my diagnosis​ even though it's been confirmed by 4 separate psychiatrists. I also have bipolar disorder, major depression, generalized anxiety, ocd, EDNOS, and panic disorder. Many people who don't have a mental illness don't understand that all of these are often symptoms of each other and are all interconnected. So often people think you're either a hypocondrac or just super ""crazy"". I just tell people that I have bipolar disorder and really bad anxiety. 
I also understand about feeling guilty. You have to remember everyone is different and everyone has their own experiences. You're allowed to feel the way you do. It's not of any choosing of your own. I've found that holding in my emotions and feeling guilty does more good than harm. I journal my emotions now and pick a person in my support system to confined in.",1
Nope you aren't wrong I have all these and find people who will listen we all deal with some kind of anxiety etc,1
"RoseMartin Rodriguez, Calina Trembly",1
"Mika Haara we all die, none of us gets out of this alive, HOWEVER, you are here on earth for a reason. Now, we all have choices. Not to choose is making a choice. Life is a fight and everyone has their own fight, their own pain. All of us are fighting for our minds. There is right and wrong, good and bad, love and fear. Once we fight for ourselves we can take our experience, speak to others in pain and walk along side them to pull them out of darkness. But no one can want you to live more than you want to live for yourself. You have the power and all you need inside you to live a great life you can't see it for some reason, but there is greatness in you!!! We all have the POWER TO CHOOSE LIFE,  IF YOU WANT TO LIVE. I PRAY YOU CHOOSE LIFE❤️",1
"Some people are very bad at under standing those who suffer any illness. To me many seem So self  righteous, children are important. So understandably a Parent Will be concerned that They are capable of doing Things The right way, therefore They need a partner who is not a selfish prig, not self righteous, not selfish. If He is So selfish & lacking In under standing he Will never make anyone happy, So ditch him The World is full of Kind, gênerous & caring men. I doubt If he Will make any one a good husband, let Alone a caring Father.",1
"Wow. Right now, you need him more than ever. Struggling with depression and anxiety is not easy, and when your supposed support network deals a blown like this, it makes you so, so much worse. Yes, being in a relationship with someone who has depression and anxiety can be hard, but if you love that person unconditionally and are committed to them, then you go above and beyond to try to understand and help them. Does he not think that if you just be ""normal"" (FYI I bloody hate that term, but you know what I mean), then you'd do it in a heart beat? Depression and anxiety are debilitating, there's no two ways about it. Quite frankly, if he can't support you in the way you need, and you don't fit his so called ""perfect"" ideal, is this really a healthy relationship to be in?",1
"Having bipolar disorder and being a parent myself, he has legitimate concerns. I am a good mother, I do anything I can to make sure my kids are taken care of...but... There have been times that I hate to admit, when I have been manic, I am not the best parent I can be. It puts a lot of strain on my kids and my significant other. He has to make up for where I am lacking and that is just added stress for him. With a good support system though, and a partner who understands the illness, it can be a sucessful family. It takes work!! From everybody. I hope they can find a way to work out their issues and be happy!",1
"I have been with a few men who couldn't handle it & it is literally awful when they don't understand or don't even try. On one hand he seems to be trying but maybe needs to try to be a bit less blunt with how he says things to you as you are gonna take it to heart, as all of us with any mental illness wear our heart on our sleeves. I am now with someone who understands so much more & jesus it is different, my sister is the one who worries about me with children but no matter how old, how drugged up or how sad I am - life goes on & if I have a sad day it's GONNA HAPPEN no matter what the situation. So we have to learn how to deal with it but that doesn't mean our mental health is gonna change. I would say see how it goes with the councillor & if they can't make him understand more then I'm afraid he never will & maybe you need someone who will support you a bit more rather than telling you, you will be a crap mum.",1
"Back in 1999 my mom and sister told me I should let my daughter go stay with my sister for a little while. I did because I was pregnant and couldn't take my meds. My mom and sister made a plan to have me sign papers for Brianna to be able to stay for the summer. It turned out they were actually adoption papers. As I was off meds, I was confused and signed the papers not fully understanding what was going on. Adoption was final 2000. My sister never let me se or talk to my daughter again. My daughter passed away in 2002 from heart complications. 

In 2012, my ex took my son away from me. The judge stated because I had been hospitalized for 5 weeks, I must have been suicidal or homicidal therefore making my ex a better person to parent. I had my son for 15 years! 

People make me so angry judging me for my mental health!",1
Yes Corina Dismang I am trying and I now realize the beautifulness ( illness) of the struggles you go through and the many reasons Im in love with you !!! I may not understand completely and learning and understanding you is always worth it ... Love you forever swee tart   ,1
"I think this is a reasonable concern for someone to have, granted, the way they went about it is horrible and sounds somewhat biased off of basic common stereotypes, it is still something that could be very serious in the future if it does turn out that way. When you have a kid, that should be your priority and you can't allow your depression to prevent you from parenting your child. Granted, I am of the mindset where my own parent had it, I have it, and I have become terrified of passing it off even further, I still think its a valid question.",1
"God forbid he has kids with a woman who will suffer from post pardom depression... and any woman who has kids and becomes a mom is never ""solid"" ... he lives in a dream world of ignorance and tv land thinking of stable solidity when kids enter the picture. It puts more strain on the marriage and everyone life... IF you don't learn to work together and pick up slack for one another... one is weak so the other will be strong and you will switch roles every now and then",1

"Some of you are giving terrible advice. I myself have depression, anxiety and bipolar so i understand that what he said hurts, but at the same time someone without these or similar illnesses has no clue what it feels like to live with them everyday. Hes right, you need to be a strong woman to raise children, but hes also trying to understand and continue the relationship despite the mental illnesses. Seeing a counselor is a great idea to help both of you understand each others concerns and positions. Work with him and see where things go.",1
Look you'll be OK I I suffer from chronic depression anxiety and bipolar and OCD and I have three beautiful children and I'm a great mom to my babies so dont let him put you down RL man doesn't do that but help you..,1
He's an absolute shithead! If only he knew what it feels like to have anxiety of depression. Such a selfish man. Thinking of himself. Maybe he should try helping you a bit & being there for you x,1
"This didn't happen to me, however a lot of my anxiety and depression came from wanting a baby, and it never being ""the right time"". Now that I have my Little Boy, and am on anxiety meds, I have never felt better! I have this incredible zest for life!!! 
I can understand his concerns, and even though they hurt, they are valid concerns that need to be addressed. I hope your therapy session goes well - there are so so so many moms (and dads) who deal with mental illness every day, and still totally Rock this whole parenting thing!!!",1
"I am divorced because my ex husband could not be supportive of my ptsd. Life is too short for him to judge you like that. Dump his ass. He is not helping, he is just upsetting you.",1
No doubt!,1
It's really hard for people to understand also specially men when they don't have what we have I just realized now 41 years old why I can stay stay when a relationship and it's because no one understand and men's try to control my life when they see me those days really depressed or without motivation they take advantage and situations that we pass like anxiety so I realize that it's better to be by myself right now that I'm not ready anymore to people try to control my life I feel like I own my own self and if someone is not happy with me and I'm not happy with that person I appreciate to be by myself and keep it moving forward I feel like I know how to control my emotions better when I'm alone then when I have someone I get very exciting when I meet people and at the end of the day everything is going away so why Try Again I'm happy right now when I have a man I get very depressed I feel they demand for too much and I don't like when people start criticizing me you can do this you could do that that they said I had to be in bed you don't even know me it can be like today A beautiful day but I feel a little drowsy I would love to be sleeping right now but I can have to do responsibility but right now no one is telling me not to do my responsibility if I wanted to I don't have to do it I don't do it but if I would have a man he would be in top of me bothering my head and I really don't want to do that anymore my life I prefer to taking care of my son 11 my dog and continue looking for God that's what I want,1
"I raised 4 sons alone. I will never say it was easy, but it can be done. Don't be with someone that doesn't see your value and your worth just because your struggling with a disease you didn't ask for. He'll probably end up being a lousy father anyway with thinking like this.",1
The chance of passing it on to a child  is big . And meds can cause horrible bith defects . I was born w 10 I am 37 and was told during my last episodes not to have them. And it sounds like the the guy wouldn't be much help. A child is a huge responsibility even if their born healthy . The risk of passing this on is real. Have you ever considered adoption? I know you want to have kids but there are so many that need good homes. Try and get your health squared away it isn't fair to put your wants before there's. Meds alone would cause them to suffer. The world is hard enough you know this suffering isn't fair for anyone. You can do what you want just do your homework get the help u need first . And go from there. I'm sure you wouldn't want your child to have the same things your dealing with. Hang in there . Your worth it. Hope this helps coming from a child who has this disease that was passed down to them not intentionally.  But we know more now. Research and weigh the odds.,1
I don't have depression or bipolar disorder but I do have a chronic illness that makes it really hard sometimes. All you can do is the best you can. Take care of yourself. It's not as if you asked to have depression or anxiety. If someone can't understand and be compassionate then they may not be the right person. I have lost alot because of illness including friends and romantic relationships the ones that took the time to try to understand I value the most. So sorry this happened. Positive thoughts sent your way. :),1
"I'm severe bipolar. Every damn day is a struggle. I don't do meds. Hate the way they messed with all of my health and created more issues. I absolutely force myself to get up, go to work, and take care of my kids. I've learned to hide my depression and anxiety ridiculously well. My wife pretty much never notices my struggle. My ex husband however used to tell me to ""take another pill"" ""you're weak"" etc. My mental illness is a huge part of me but it doesn't shape who I am. I'm opposite of most on this post and my advice is to push yourself every single day. Even if you just get up and shower, you at least conquered one battle. One battle at a time each day and congratulate yourself on each step... in the end, you are the only one that will change you, support you, and stand by you. Maybe he's not the right guy. You have to learn to love you and embrace all of you before you worry about his acceptance.",1
"Walking... a lot. Diet helps too. Things like turkey and chicken help with sleep. Anxiety is harder. Mine hits with change and a lot at night with dreams. Typically I have to sit in the car and talk myself down if I'm out in public. At night my wife is really awesome about just holding me until it passes. I do a lot of vitamins as well. Lol, it works for me but I had to rewire my thinking and that took sometime.",1
I rely on meds..... U are very strong!!! I absolutely believe in pushing one's self!!! The results shock and amaze you!!!! How do you cope when agitation kicks in? And anxiety? One follows the other with me and haunts me to move end!   ,1
"I suffer with depression and severe anxiety. I have 3 children, I get up for them and care for them. Are some days harder than others absolutely. But I live for them. My Partner understands and we talk about it I tell him when I'm down and most of all I share when I'm scared. He is my rock and when I need a moment he steps right up. Your not incapable he is. He wants to add to your insecurities by telling you that your not ""solid"". Solidity between couples is built, each one puts their work in. You got this girl, and the right ""solid man"" is out there for you.",1
"The thing you have to understand is that yes, depression is mentally and physically exhausting to you. But it is for them too. Maybe not as bad, but it is. I struggle with major depression and pretty bad anxiety and I'm a mother of a 13 month old girl. Being a mother has helped me in ways that medication cannot. But I refuse to take medication at all, so I do it all on my own. 
Just be understanding of him, and the most you can do is go to therapy. Do not be mad, but you have a right to be upset. 

You can get through this, both of you can .  But both of you need patience.",1
"I have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life. I get your struggle. However, I'm sorry, I totally understand his text. He is completely right in his concerns.",1
"Wow.  Some of the advice being given is just horrible.  He's willing to go to her counselor.   He's willing to express his feelings and worries.  He has legitimate concerns.  How about give her real advice besides, you should dump him, he's not willing to understand . You're kidding right.  He's doing everything to try to be there and understand.  Maybe y'all need to be more understanding.  Just because we have mental illness does not mean we can wave it around like a white flag every time something goes wrong and be off the hook. And if we don't get let off the hook it's a chorus of, oh they're not willing to understand. No you're not willing to understand.  The diagnosis is not a get out of jail free card for your behavior and choices. 
If this is the actions he sees every day them good on him for speaking up and saying his concerns. Kids are hard work and sometimes it's going to be hard, especially when depressed.  Let's not pretend it's not",1
I've been in this predicament and it's taken a while but hubby has come around to seeing the bigger picture. It took for me to see it too...... I have a few lazy days then balance it out by going batshit crazy when I have the energy to go!! Haha.... It really takes understanding on both sides for each other to get anywhere.... The fact he's not holding it in means he's fighting for the relationship.... How u go about it from here on in knowing this affects that. Let him see Ur best and worst hun!!! (bipolar and anxiety)   ,1
"Agreed. One really does have to pull oneself together for one's children. However hard it is though, I think the best parts are when you surprise yourself by doing what needs to be done regardless of your own anxiety or whatever. One gets to sit back at the end of the day and say ha! I did it and pat oneself on the back. It proves to oneself that one really can do it, in  spite of everything.

The guy sounds great. You really should work for him he sounds worth the effort.",1
"Yup. And let me second that kids are EXTREMELY hard. They aren't going to validate you or make your life better. They can be great for couples but for many couples they cause strain. Med changes & adjustments? No luxury for that with kids...you don't even go to the bathroom by yourself for a couple of years. If you don't have a very understanding partner to raise the kids, then you're screwed. I don't know this couples exact situation but better he bring it up now rather than 5 years and two babies down the road, after post partum hits hard and both are angry and sad: him from resentment and her from pain (which we all sympathize with, of course, that's why we're here!). I'm hoping his text was for an open, loving talk. I hope the best for her-for both of them. Getting that text must have been so heart wrenching and I'm so sorry. But I can't knock him for at least trying to have the discussion about his fears.",1
"Anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder can be easily overcome once you understand how your mind works. I had bipolar disorder myself for 10 years. Now I am med free and back to normal. I am helping other people overcome their issues. If interested message me.",1
"I am very self aware (shocks the hell out of my counselor sometimes) and no, it is not ""easily overcome"" at any point. Even though I know the coping skills, even though I may know why I'm feeling the way I am at that point, even though I, for the most part, understand the disorder and have done extensive research on my diagnosis, it has never been ""easily overcome"". It is something that I have to work hard at, daily. And some days, I am just too mentally, emotionally, and physically tired to handle much of anything. I have My days when I have very few spoons to start my day, and I struggle more so on those days. Once again, this is not something ""easily overcome"" for most people with these illnesses.",1
"This is why I am single with no children... I've just seen my fella through two years after he had a meltdown down ... I helped him because I know from experience what he needed.
But earlier this year I ran out of steam and my bipolar kicked in. I thought he would understand my anxiety and depression as he was so recently there himself.  But not a chance.... it's all about him and he only wants me for how I can help him when he's down.
Guess what? 
After a lot of heartache I'm single again.
It takes someone really amazing to understand and support someone close when the black dog strikes.",1
It's the truth. Some days I have to fight myself to be there for my kids. It's a struggle but I have back up plans when there is a need for help.,1
"My fiance and I both have anxiety..I have depression with anxiety. His anxiety is daily and constant and makes him question our relationship, and makes him repeat the same things over and over. My depression makes it impossible for me to get out of bed, talk, move, or even move my eyes. It's difficult but communication is key. I hope a therapist can help you, I'm considering getting one for me and my fiance",1
"I firmly believe that if you are unable to take care of s child yourself, don't have one.

Bipolar, disassociative disorder, PTSD since I was four months old, BPD, anxiety. I get my ass up every day and take care of my kids. I know people with cancer who are in better shape than I am. So yes, I would say it.",1
My husband who's very scientific struggles with understanding my daughters mental illness.  But one thing he does not dispute is that she is the best mom.  Her illness has made her even more accepting and compassionate to people's needs and differences.  It took him some time in counseling to open his eyes.  Let your therapist and dr help you make your decision. Bless you.,1
"I will be praying for you!  
I am going through something similar.  I have been trying to get a divorce since April 2016 after 33 years of marriage.  My depression and anxiety were used against me.  He had me hospitalized several times and I had to leave for my sanity!
I met a new man and everything was great until I couldn't control my crying.  He doesn't understand either.  
I am a good, kind person who helps everyone else.",1

"This sucks writing this because i have bipolar type 2 as well as ptsd but this mentality is making us sicker. I say this because if we hole up and isolate. Stay indoors and shut out the lights. We're only feeding our depression what it wants. It's impossible to get better even in the slightest bit if we play this card. Is it hard to get out of bed for me? Yes. Do i spend soo much time in my head that i come up with the most irrational thoughts? Yup. But i try to do as much as i can in a day even if I'm choking back tears and wanting to just disappear. All of us have that one person,some many more than one, that depends on us breathing. That alone makes us special. We are way too hard on ourselves at times and no one might understand our issues but someone out there loves us for the messes we are unconditionally. And that's beautiful.",1

"I've had some jobs that sounded great at the time, to find that they were meaningless pressure cookers that paid well, and didn't really improve the life of anyone around me. Even providing direct care in hospitals, so satisfying and the pay is fair, comes with a set of shackles that prevented me from doing the right thing for sick people. I dropped out of nursing school with one semester to go. I got a master's in social work, and am pursuing counseling careers. At least I have something to say about the treatment plan. I'll take a pay cut for that.",1
"Are you doing what you love or what you think is expected of you? After exhausting my FMLA for other family members, I left my job. Love the job, but not the politics.

Courage is simply taking your fear and moving forward, not allowing fear to pigeon-hole you in life. Don't be afraid to do what you love. It may not be the popular thing, but it will bring you peace❤️",1
"I also felt anxious every day going to work, then I started to look at the whole picture. I really looked at the things that led up to my anxiety. During my first two years attendance was terrible, and last year I was hospitalized for having a full blown breakdown.  I came to realize my job was not worth the stress or my mental health. I just looked for another job with different advantages. This may just not be the job for you right at this moment in time.  But let a Dr or therapist know how you feel.  It may help getting on an anxiety med.",1
Try to get help with your doctor because they have medication for anxiety and they will help you a lot good luck,1
I hope you can talk to your dr about this soon.  Maybe you can get FMLA or even better a paid medical leave.  I had FMLA for mental health days.  Once it was in place my boss couldn't give me a hard time about needing to be off or anxiety at work.  Reach out.  Blessings.,1

This is me all over    forever making plans then if I feel low on the day I say I'm ill and literally lie in bed all day doing nothing. Don't no why I'm like this but it's horrible as it makes me feel miserable but nothing makes me snap out of the low depressed feeling untill the day I wake up feeling happier.

"I love this!!! I wish more people understood the effects and struggles that people with bipolar disorder/anxiety/depression and or, all of the above, deal with each and every day! It's a constant struggle to stay on track and adapt to the changes that come up in your routine!!!! It's very challenging and overwhelming but somehow, someway, we adjust the best we can and move on!!! I have always been embarassed for being bipolar along with having anxiety and depression... I always felt like I was crazy... I hated it! But, recently I have learned more about being bipolar and I am gonna embrace it and make the best of it! I deserve to have a good life and I will make it the best i can despite what mental disorders I may have!!! My goal through it all is to go from saying, ""I suffer from bipolar disorder"" to embracing it and being able to realize it's a diagnosis... it doesn't mean that i have to let it bring me down, i will embrace it and make the best of it, not just for myself, but for my husband and my 2 girls that i have been blessed with!! #bipolarawareness #iwearPURPLEforbipolaranxietyawarenesss #lovethesupportpage",1
What Happens in the mind is the most scariest thing ever my mind is truly fucked up...,1
This this and this. So afraid.,1
"Finding a way to FORCE yourself out of bed, even if it's just to the mailbox does make your entire day different. You at least make it to the couch and think about leaving the house. Some days you end up leaving. Some days you are then able to force yourself to do some chores, especially if you have someone depending on you to do so. 

I know, I may sound like someone who doesn't understand - but TRUST me , I do. 

I'm there right now, went somewhere and forced myself thru it. Back home now and feel the same way. However I am forcing myself to go to IOP at the local hospital, before it gets so bad I need to go inpatient. 

This life sux, but having just that one person that understands and doesn't judge changes your life entirely - you just can't overload them or expect them to change you. You HAVE to put in the Edson, period. And yes, I agree it IS the first sign. It is not easy. It does suck, and I simply couldn't force myself through an 8 hour work day yet. If you do, and can, my hats off to you.

Some of us that deal with these issues are the strongest people in the whole DAMN world even though we appear very weak to others. 

I'm hoping this group I'm starting soon, have my intake hearing today, puts me in touch with others going through the same thing .. and we can help each other. At this point in my life, I STRONGLY believe it is something I need in my life. Not just the online forums I visit when I get rough. Basically an accountability partner. One that understands and u derstands you understand them. Close by so you can force each other to have a cup of coffee at McDonalds, or visit each other if all you can do is make it to the couch.

It sounds so damn cliche and it's what we hear from people who have no idea what we deal with - but the last year I've found it's true. Finding inner strength and not pouring my problems on others unless I absolutely have to has made me a stronger person. It sure as shit isn't my medication changes. 

If any of you are in this situation, and need someone to talk to drop me a line. I'm at the point in my life where I want to help others. It makes you get out of yourself and how you dwell on how you feel. It changes your,life but it is SO FAR from being easy. Believe me I understand those of you who will say ... ""He is just like everyone else"" if you want to talk about the very slow steps I've taken drop me a line. I'm teller you, it's been baby steps. Little baby steps over and over.",1
Oh yes that is me. I dislike being forced. My partner is rugby mad and often wants me to share in he's activities. Omw what a strain. I feel like screaming out to him   Just leave me alone.  But it's he's  way of thinking that's what I need.   ,1
It swindled me in... Was in the house for almost 3 months straight I finally decided to fight back and take my kids out for a day of fun and ended up with a fractured elbow. Between the depression and anxiety I've been dealing with it took about a week to convince myself I could handle one day. My kids had a blast so I guess it was worth it. It's been a bit tougher now that I'm dealing with so much pain and an itch that I can't scratch due to this cast... Ughhh I sometimes wish I could have an out of my body and mind experience just to be normal for a day and be able to cope with things like others do,1
"I struggle with this daily. I FORCE myself to get up because of my 4 yr old....i fight hard for him, wish I knew how to get better",1
I know I have the same problem and has been said sometimes I win and sometimes the depression wins.  It's a real struggle.,1
I struggle to fight my way through the depression I don't want it to totally take over so I fight hard . Sometimes I win sometimes the depression wins. But I will never stop fighting. The hardest thing is fighting alone and having no one know or understand what your going through or even care.,1
Been like this for six months. Cost me a marriage. I wish ppl would know how hard anxiety and depression cam be.,1
I have bipolar and a lot of anxiety. I have  that feeling  every morning lately. Even though I'm on my meds. It just started out the blue. I force myself up but cannot get motivated till at least 11am. It's horrible. I wish I can just be normal. !!!  Hope this does not go on too long as I cannot carry on like this.,1
"Me too. We just have to remember that there are times when we do feel ""normal"" even if it's short lived, and keep our perspective that this low time will pass either on its own, or with a change in meds/ therapy. Also, I, for one, have to give myself permission to rest and be unproductive for awhile because I know that's how my body operates. I've been trying to go with the flow lol. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. At least we can take comfort in knowing that we are definitely not alone in our struggles❤️ God is here, and so is Facebook  ",1
"It's that consuming dreaded feeling in the pit of your stomach & you honestly don't know if you can do it, but if you're getting the right help, it'll give you the strength to push through it.   ",1
"It ended my last relationship. It was the best decision of my life though. They were a very outgoing person I met when I was manic so we totally clicked then of course. 

Getting out of the relationship and someone trying to force me every damn day (which only made me feel worse about myself) was great for me. I felt horrible about it for a year because she was a great person and had great intentions. But I ended up feeling dependent on them. Again. That made you feel less confident. Getting away from those who push you so hard is very important for your self confidence. On top,of that you are harming THEIR life. If you really do care about them, letting them go is the best thing you can do for them. Even though it sucks. 

You can then find ways to make yourself stronger on your own, at your own pace. 

I know that's not what you want to hear but the best therapist in the world will tell you flat out its bad for you and them. Only harms you both and stops both of you from having better lives. Drop me a line if you want to k ow my entire experience ...

Ultimately, I realize I'm just not supposed to be in a relationship ... it's just not healthy. Makes it harder on me and destroys the other persons life as well. Good luck !",1
"The worst is when they think that you'll feel better if you go somewhere to have a change of scenery.  That actually makes me worse   I've learned to compromise. If they are trying to get me out of bed to go somewhere, say out to dinner, I'll get up and try to get ready. If I'm still too anxious to go, we end up ordering something in. That way, the other person gets my time and attention, but I don't have to face the outside world.  This is just what works for me, but compromise is always worth a try imo.",1
"Difficult part for me is, I have a partner with very similar issues as me, but those issues manifest in very different ways. Me, anxiety or depression means I shut off and get super implosive, her, needs to talk through everything and resolve every last detail... which leads to very negative results from time to time   ",1
Just ask them to seriously back off.  Explain yourself and hopefully they try to understand.  It's been a struggle for me the last 2+ yrs and at least mom understands.. I cant do everything nowadays :/.,1

To define mania as being happy and energetic is inaccurate. There are real problems with being irritable and unable to control your pressured speech when experiencing a mania. It's far from being happy and energetic.,1

"There's so many more options for you to chose from, keep searching and don't give up! I'm on 3 different meds for anxiety and depression. Together they seem to all be doing the trick.

A true warrior in the mist of your suffering  that's what you actually are... the movement needs people like you...its awesome  I did try many years ago to kill myself and then 4 years ago I wanted to gas my self....  thank the Lord Jesus I didn't. See I saw that bi polar isn't like living in a cave (the light only stays in the cave) but more it's like a tunnel, because there is always light at the end of the tunnel...im going through a very stressful time... but yet I see hope.... think it's my faith that helps me to tell you the truth. Crazy thing is when I'm manic I called my self ""the white princess of africa"" I know it sounds crazy. But in my bi polar mind. This princess has a story to tell about her faith and she calls it Africa because I live here and that is who I preach to when I'm in mania. I always preach to African people here because just like me they struggle in poverty....so I see where that pain is coming from because even thou my pain is different it's the same. I had therapy and the white princess is gone. But it was a crazy fun scary time in my life. Thank God",1
"This might sound odd, but do you take a magnesium supplement? That makes a huge difference with my anxiety. I take a combination calcium/magnesium/ vitamin D3 supplement, and it helps a lot. Over the winter my anxiety levels were getting very high, and it was almost becoming debilitating. I'm already on a 4 med cocktail, and didn't want to add more pills. I started researching safe home remedies and discovered that magnesium deficiency symptoms are almost the same as anxiety. That's when I realized that I'd stopped taking them. (Bottle ran out and I forgot to pick up another one.) After a week back on the supplement, my anxiety levels dropped. So nice to not have 24/7 tremors and panic attacks.",1

There ya go. Keep your mind active. Pm me if you'd like whenever you're anxious or lonely.,1
That's a GREAT thing!! Has he ever helped relax you when you're feeling anxious? Exercise is the best medicine....idle hands...,1
"You're right, pills won't cure it...knowing that helps, because you know to expect good days and bad. My anxiety got so bad, my Dr gave me klonopin, which does help but makes me SO TIRED and sleepy, I use it Very sparingly",1
I have been on effexor for about 10 years and it's mellowed out my depression and anxiety but like today I don't feel it mellowing anything out. But I also know one pill isn't going to cure depression.,1
"Actually, in behavioural therapy you slowly work your way up to more and more exposure to things that cause anxiety. While you are exposed to your anxiety causing trigger or situation your therapist helps you practice coping skills to deal with situation. The better you get at coping and the more positive outcomes you have during these exercises the less anxiety you will feel. Combine this with the proper medication and it can make a world of difference.",1
Indeed. Someone who has no idea what they are doing and forcing you against your will is never okay! I was just saying that positive and monitored exposure is healthy. This post kind of makes it sound like people should never face their anxiety. Idk just how I perceived it I guess.,1
Okay but therapy is something that the person with anxiety is willing to partake in. There is consent to being gently forced into the situation that causes anxiety. There is no consent in a friend or family member forcing you to do the thing despite you saying no and giving a valid reason of it screwing with anxiety.,1
"Ain't cured by avoiding it either, all about getting the balance right and understanding why we're anxious. ✌️",1
"I've lost 3 friends because they felt that no one could help them. They gave up. I can relate to them but don't want to give up. I keep reminding myself of what I have in my life that keeps me going. It's definitely not easy. It breaks my heart to think of their families who are struggling to understand why their loved one gave up. I don't want that for my family. I don't want to stop fighting despite how bad things are. I know eventually, I'll have the help I need to live life without pain. God bless all who struggle.",1

"I have the most problems with sleep, too. I take a sleeping medicine, my mood stabilizer makes me sleepy, and my doctor still proscribes xanax to help with my anxiety. All that said, the thing that has helped me most is listening to guided meditations as I go to sleep and practicing meditation during the day - even just being quiet for a certain amount of time and breathing slow and easy. If you have iPhone there's an app called Meditation Studio that I really like. It cost like four dollars but there's no other ""in app purchases.""",1
Yes both of those. Happens when I have my anxiety attacks.,1
Anxiety can cause your throat to feel like its closing also. Go to the dr just in case. It happens to me but im not on any medication.,1
"If you feel like your throat is closing up, you may want to see a doctor. You could be having an allergic reaction. I found out I am allergic to Latuda and vistaril. Both of them make my throat close up and hyperventilate. It feels like a panic attack but it's not",1
"You should seek therapy before you do anything. I went to therapy and learned ways to deal with anxiety and depression, it helped a lot.",1
"When you get your panic attacks, is there anything you can do to help calm yourself down (ie listen to music, deep breathing, etc)?",1
I try everything to overcome but nothing is working.. it works for only few time .. the most irritating I feel is panic attack .. I had never  face this situation in my life..,1
Don't be afraid there is help,1
Thank you. Meds were changed last Thursday & I now have to take one mid day & I'm afraid I won't remember.,1
Welcome to my day. The only difference is my only thoughts during the day (especially at a job I hate...but with no transportation to get another one)...I am indecisive on the best way to make the pain end. Came to the realization the other day that no matter which method I deal with...it's going to hurt as much or worse than what I've been going through all my life. I don't have an answer...but with the way it looks like the SHTF with healthcare/safety net...even this may not have an answer for the pain question.,1

"OP here: I spoke with my doctor, and she said that I need to be working there already for me to have her fill out an ADA (it's a disability accommodation form, which is what the company gave me) and I asked her if she read it... because the first question was literally ""if (name) is able to do these tasks without accommodation, there is no need to fill out the remainder of the form) which then clears me to move forward with the application status. 
What upsets me the most is that HR pressured me to disclose my mental disability, despite that I said it wouldn't get in the way of work. I could be working already.",1
Bipolar and anxiety were actually included on a application i just filled out for a job. I checked prefer not ti answer. Im starting to wonder if my hospitalization when i was 17 was popping up. Im in il and tried to get a foid card and that popped up.,1
This is such a huge mess. If it weren't for the fact that I need health insurance and a new car (I totaled mine) I would be looking elsewhere. But I'm desperate and it's within walking distance.,1
"I once had a psychological sort of test before hiring, where they even asked you if you had suicidal thoughts lol.  And all sorts of strange questions so that they could know every aspect of you which, in my opinion, is nothing else but manipulation. Those results go to the employer. Even if they say it's confidential haha. nothing is confidential with big companies. What were they going to do if i said I had big anxiety? treat me like a special case in case I got hired? wtf? Anyway, disclosing these or not, for people with high anxiety, at jobs where high interaction and almost constant pressure is present, these various disorders are going to show themselves at times, whether we like it or not. You can't fake it all the time. Unfortunately haha. Anyway, really sad case here, and my point would be, just don't be honest to the employers cause they're only manipulators and can replace you in a second...",1
The need to know that they won't exasserbate your condition or harm you. If the job caused you harm they'd be liable. If your doctor doesn't sign it because they're worried then you shouldn't be working,1
Someone I love very much exhibits some of these symptoms. Her freedom from anxiety is my greatest hope. She deserves every happiness.,1
And when you have anxiety panic attacks. Recycle complete meltdown. Looking from the outside-in. And nothing you can do about. get out of the area and then get calm down. The best way you can. Without hurting yourself or others.,1
Watching your child struggle with it for as long as you can remember....it's the worst. Having it myself....i know the struggle all too well.,1
I agree with you.  I also hate to see my daughter struggle with it.  I hate the pain it causes me to have.  Prayers to you and your child.,1
"So true. I will sit there telling myself ""just go. No one cares. No one is looking at you."" However that sense of panic I get keeps my butt glued to my seat!",1
I hate that too. I get so uncomfortable being stared down in public. I have to force myself sometimes to do things like go to the bathroom because i know people will stare at me.,1
Being alone sucks and is scary,1
Depression/Anxiety....seasonal depression. Would love to connect with others that really get the struggle....,1
Most people suffer in silence; too ashamed  to  ask for help do not judge a book by it's  cover.,1
I battle it every day  horrible sickness,1
You continue to struggle daily with bipolar illness and this really describes your life.  Keep on with your therapist and your commitment for DBT.  You can live despite this illness until thru research there are better answers.,1
I struggle all the time with this. Its so hard to live a normal life like this.,1
"sometimes, yes, you should be afraid of me im sorry to say...",1
"I don't agree with some of these. Like ""don't take it personally"" or ""there's no reason to be afraid of me."" If we don't want our own feeling invalidated, we shouldn't do it to others. Been living with BPD a long time and I've lost people I love because it was too much for their own hearts to handle. I don't fault them at all. The majority is great, though, and I absolutely relate.",1
"Sorry, but that's not true, there's a lot of people who; could be with the perfect partner and not feel good enough because of their own struggles.im one of those people that regardless, I feel I'm never good enough. Being in a relationship doesn't ""magically change that"" 
However, if you only doubt yourself when with someone, and rarely ever do, then yeah, they aren't good enough",1
"For my depression and anxiety, and the support of mental illness that run in my family. Love and peace all stay strong",1
"I had the same situation. I was introduced to a guy and found out he likes me. I liked him too. We went on a few dates but I was feeling horrible. All I wanted to do was stay in bed and sleep all day. I cancelled our last date because I couldn't get out of bed. That was the day I was going to tell him what was going on. Haven't talked to him since. I tried contacting him to get back together but he didn't get back to me.

If they aren't willing to take you for you, they aren't meant for you and it's time to move on.",1
"I agree, Cameron Harman. If she cannot handle it you will know how she feels and can agree to keep an emotional distance between each other but you will not feel the need to actively avoid her. On the other hand, she may be willing to give it a go. Then you won't, again, have to actively avoid her. 

Do you know if she has noticed you avoiding her? Don't you think she may take this to mean you really are not interested? Everyone deserves some happiness, don't screw it up for both of you.",1
"You could even write it in a letter (old school, I know, but it shows how much you care). When you hand it to her, tell her that there are some things you wanted her to know, but are hard for you to talk about. The ball will be in her court then. If she doesn't want to continue with the relationship, don't let that get you down. Some people can't handle those of us with special needs because it's not easy.  Neither one of you would be a ""bad person"" if this happens. On the other hand, she may be open to going further with you.The unknowns and what-ifs of any situation causes us more stress than almost anything else. God bless, my friend!",1
"It has been a long struggle for me. When I finally got my diagnosis, I was in my late 40's. It took a few more years to get the right cocktail. And even then, the meds have had to be adjusted.  But I don't think I would go back. The next biggest hurdle is to change my mindset. Things will NOT always be so negative. I cannot live this way and the only way I can do that is within myself. I can make the choice to be miserable or take steps to change how I look at life. I've lived my life for 59 years being miserable, it is time I changed that! I have an amazing support system that is helping me.",1
"Yes, it sucks. Pun intended, it's hard to take. It's humbling to be dependent and it's a pain to remember and it's scary to fear running out, and on top of all that it's expensive. But medication keeps me stable, and I feel that it's worth it in the long run. Untreated, my bipolar disorder made my life chaotic and unproductive, not to mention terribly painful. Being sane is priceless and I try to be thankful that there is a treatment for my condition.",1
"This is true, especialy for bipolar. Both therapy and meds work best. I have BP and anxiety and have been able, through years of therapy, learn coaping stratgies and recognize when an episode is coming. Right now I am not on medication for either because the therapy has been sucessfull. I still have issues sometimes, still see my therapist and doctor to make sure I stay ok, but I've been able respond in a healthy way and avoid trouble.",1
Rebecca Sokol I never forget about that word that you say if you would have have diabetes I used to have a therapist told me that one day think about you had IBT and if you don't take your meds you will die sounds bad day I got so scared because they told me they can cut any part of my body so for many years now I'm taking my meds but I still feel bad because my daughter have the same illness and she doesn't want to take her medication and we don't have no more communication she lost all her friends she lost one of her job now she's on another job because she doesn't want to take meds but you're right we need to take our Mets and think about we have diabetes God bless you sweetie goodnight,1
I don't know u well enough to tell u alot but I'm goin through the same thing like I was on different meds for bipolar depression and epilepsy but none of them worked so I stop taking them and I'm still struggling with it so I know what u mean,1
I struggle with depression alot if you need someone to talk or anyone does don't hesitate to message me I'm usually up late so even if it's late shoot me a message   ,1
"Kay honey you are not alone. I know how impossible it is when you try to function like a normal person but your body just physically can't and you feel like shit physically which makes you more depressed which makes the pain worse and it's this whole maddening cycle of seemingly endless defeat. I know. I am right here In this darkness with you. When you have to battle your mind and body just to achieve the simplest tasks, things other people would never even think twice about. But you are still valid. There's still hope. Bc there's shit that can be done to make it better, to make it manageable. Just one step at a time. One obstacle at a time. One diagnosis/treatment plan at a time. Being admitted is a great first step in achieving that. Esp if you feel like you may harm yourself. You can be in a safe place , and assess all of your issues with a team of professionals to come.up with a comprehensive plan. To treat body and mind. And if they don't have the proper specialist in hand, I'm sure someone there would be able to refer you to someone or point you in the right direction. And I know it seems scary, but a 72hr hold really isn't that bad. It's actually really helpful, and staying longer can ensure you're regulated properly on all the right meds and the drs can make sure no side effects and everything is good. And usually there's a social worker who can talk to you about your living arrangements and if they are okay/safe, work/disability,  support groups and even bridging the gap with your family. I've been through this particular wringer a few times, and you really do come out better in the end. It's like creating a new solid foundation to build a new better life and you on. With the proper support in place. Bc you're not alone. And you don't ever have to be. There's a whole swarm of people waiting to help you at your local hospital love, and we're all here , I'm here. We gotchu. Please I urge you to consider going in immediately and self admitting if you're having suicidal ideations. Even if you're not having those thoughts at the moment , it's still a good idea to go in, just bc you can have a sense of peace around you, be still for a few days to regroup, you can address all of your issues both mental and physical with the drs, get meds sorted out and just stabilize. It's such a good place to regroup for moving forward. Anyway, sorry for babbling on, I just hope you're okay honey . I want you to okay. And safe and well. You can msg me if you want.       ",1
Thank you... I needed to hear this. I will consider this step a lot more seriously now... but I want to try fighting a bit more on my own just for a bit longer. I want to see if I can get through. But... I won't hesitate if it gets that bad again. Thank you.,1
"I suffer with PTSD, anxiety, depression and bipolar for over 17 years now, I have been battling since then. I want to share my newest ink. Loving your tattoo. Thanks for sharing.",1
I am one of those battling with anxiety disorder but I am coping  because I am aware now,1
"I have depression,anxiety and panic disorder,I have one tattoo that says stay strong and never give up and another that says my story isn't over yet ;",1
I am alone as I go through my days with this awful deasese I fight n fight but I feel know one caes nor does anyone love me the world is so cold n lonely who to turn to becuz when I turn there is know one so I hold my head down n cry as I know I'm nothing I am worthless.  I struggle n struggle but I'm only me,1
"I have been off my meds since November. I know I need to get back on them but I am so afraid of the reaction I have been experiencing to them. I am Bipolar with PTSD. I have been on meds for 32 years. At first the meds seem to work great but eventually I start hallucinating, losing sleep or cycling thru mania to psychosis. I talk to my drs about these issues but usually they just prescribe another med that supposedly treats the side effect. I also have severe RA and progressive MS. Trying to maintain both physical and mental health is overwhelming. I know I need to get back on some meds for my mental issues but I am not very hopeful that they will help. Any advice or new meds that might help?",1
"I'm on methadone, 2 different antidepressants, a mood stabilizer, and a pill that helps with the body temperature side effects of the methadone. 
All that and I still get depressed, anxious, moody, and drug cravings. 
I wish I could take a month off of life and raising 3 kids to get off of all that but I can't. Right now, the mess help me to continue on with life and my responsibilities. But I hope some day I'm the near future I can be medication free.",1
"I'm on 7 Ned's for severe bipolar one, anxiety, and ADHD it makes me so thankful to have an awesome psyc dr who really cares and helps me, without the mess I'd live in hospitals",1
"When an episode hits me I get down on the fact I have to take pills to be ""almost"" normal... but I am grateful that I can pick through my thoughts 80% of the time, and when I can't it's bad. So I am grateful for my meds. I'm also ptsd, bipolar 1, and anxiety. I DONT miss the nightmares and terrors. So I tell myself if I was asthmatic I wouldn't be ashamed to have my inhaler so why do I need to be ashamed of meds that help my brain disease? Another way to look at it.",1
I take 3 different types of medications for anxiety/depression. I hate the fact that I rely on them to feel 'normal' but then I think of the alternative and I'm grateful to have found medication that works for me!,1
Use to happen to me all the time when I just got over a really long manic episode. It wore off the more stable I became. It was frustrating and scary. Good luck just be patient with yourself,1
I got bipolar disorder 2 and PTSD and I don't know lately what's going on with me I used to be very friendly looking for friends always give opportunity to people to be in my life but right now I really don't want to socialize at all I go to the street and speak with everyone and treat everybody good but when it's about people asking me for my phone I start lying to them because I don't want to have friends out there I just realized that all the time make people and they know what I have or have to tell them what I have right away they start treating me differently and I'm getting tired about then I born by myself and I'm bored with it tween why should I have to care about what other things about me all the way I am I prefer to be alone even man I'm sick about it what I leave in the Bronx New York they call woman's crazy if they know you got bipolar they don't have respect and I don't have time to get upset I prefer to be alone for happy,1
"I actually recently heard, that you can have PTSD w dissociative features, I've had this happen. If you don't remember something, and are worried about it, if you feel comfortable, ask about what happened. Could help ease your mind a little..",1
"One thing that helped with my social anxiety was to pick out one thing a person said to follow up on or ask about... I fear the Awkward silences and pauses... I also like using ""positive sentence starters"" like, ""Oh really? That's so awesome"" or ""Wow I really like that"" 
I don't experience blackouts the way you're describing, but I do often find I talk in circles when I'm anxious",1
I will constantly black out mid conversation or forget what I just finished saying. It gets worse when my anxiety is triggered which will always trigger my agoraphobia,1
Unfortunately I'm not sure what to tell you about your housing situation I don't know where you live and if social services will help but if your really worried about your housing situation maybe you can try and get into a shelter it may not be ideal but it's better than being homeless for the most part I know that sounds like bad advice and I'm sorry I did live in two shelters myself I didn't enjoy it but I did take steps to better myself there and hopefully you can too and as far as the relationship goes maybe you can talk with your ex boyfriend/friend and see if he is still willing to give you emotional/social support I know it's hard because one or both of you may still have feelings but it might be worth a shot but if your too nervous to do that you can reach out to me I'm a great listener and I really like to make people feel better and open to me just some food for thought I won't be offended if you don't want to.,1
"Thank you Monica. I was able to talk with the people where I am and all is good. I'm just really fragile right now from the way that everyone else has treated me that I was afraid they would do the same thing. As far as the dating thing... I wanted to talk about, he didn't, leaving me to figure it out by myself. Thursday seemed to be back to our old friendship; but in a new, better, fresh way with him being more ready to start dating. I've just been frustrated in the waiting and trying to cope with the pain of losing my friend when I've had alot going on and need social support.",1
"In reading this I realized again, how lucky I was when I became so I'll. My employer? Wanted me to get better. I put a huge strain on my co workers. And they worked tirelessly to accommodate me. I finally gave up and quit..some people aren't so lucky. I'm sorry for that, in your case. Also I had a therapist that knew exactly what to do Again extremely lucky. My Dr. The Nurses. All of them. There are programs like Respite. Or maybe if you can trade housekeeping for a room, or caregiver until you find your way. S. Security/disability. I'm quite sure you weren't asking anyone to solve your problems. Its hard sometimes when a person is overwhelmed, to be so perfect in explaining what they need from others. Happens to me all the time. I gave up the dating world a long time ago. Its to difficult for me personally. I'm not even close to being ready for that. For you, may be different. Probly not the best when you meet in treatment. So many intense emotions being shared can trick you into thinking its love. (Not impossible tho) I think they call it Trauma Bonding. Also... exercising doesn't help everybody. Keep asking for help and you'll find something that works for you.",1
"Thank you Heather. You have no idea how much I feel loved reading this right now. I was able to talk with the people where I am and all is good. I'm just really fragile right now from the way that everyone else has treated me that I was afraid they would do the same thing. As far as the job, I knew the new one was a problem and had to go because my health is more important; so I quit. My therapist is wonderful. And I do the work outside sessions. Therapists have said I actually process too much. As for the dating situation, Thursday seemed to be back to our old friendship; but in a new, better, fresh way with him being more ready. I've just been frustrated in the waiting and trying to cope with the pain of losing my friend when I've had alot going on and need social support. My counselor has actually not discouraged me from never being in a relationship, but to be cautious and let it happen when I am in a good place and willing to work at it, he thinks the support would be good for me.",1
I  think your being to hard on yourself stay in treatment and keep trying w the meds. Focus on you and your recovery stop worrying about everything and everyone else take a deep breath exercise get out of bed for awhile you can always go back to bed but I fins if I shower and get ready for the day I feel much better.just take some me time. Your worth it. Hang in there I know first hand it's not easy. But u can only change you.,1
"Stephanie, Thank you for again reminding me that I am sick. Unfortunately, the rest of life doesn't stop just because of an illness and personally I want to overcome it which means learning to cope with problems not excusing them. I was specifically asking for help on the housing relationship and dating situation, which I admitted my responsibility of bad thinking and where it was coming from. Continuing to ignore problems that include other people only makes them worse. I didn't need to be told I was worrying about everyone else, when I was actually worrying about myself being homeless and alone. Wondering if you actually read what I wrote? At least you got me working on my junk again! Now if only I can figure out how to face it!   ",1
For many who suffer from anxiety issues half of the ideas on this list cause anxiety & the rest are near impossible when anxious!,1
Trouble is when you feel anxious almost all of those things are impossible to do anyway!!!,1
go on the internet increases my anxiety....,1
Not just that.. it becomes an addiction after awhile.  I do it all the time.  Then I find myself buying things I don't really need.  Then realizing your broke causes more anxiety...,1
I was just going to post shopping makes me more anxious.,1
That was really good that's like a lesson to learn all my family never want to deal with me my bipolar 2 we major depression when my mother died I was just 11 and a half so that my living hell nah My Two children has the same thing and me and my daughter can live together she's 21 it's really hard and painful my son has autism we bipolar right now he's at the hospital he got days he can't control himself but every one thing that I don't have nothing in my community because I don't act aggressive the days I don't feel good I stay home or I go right away to my psychiatric increase or remove medicine then I'm working for me and they give me new medications I've been like that all my life also I used to have ADHD right now is getting to me like today I have surgery my hands and I don't even hear the phone ringing my daughter say how you doing how is the surgery I only got a couple friends not too many anymore and they alway from this country but they got me support and that what's up and a lot of people my community my doctors and I really appreciate that but lately I've been thinking about what I'm doing this were leaving with this illness I feel guilty like I did something wrong my life and then I start thinking I never been bad in my life I'm always do the right thing and always help others and I'm a happy person we others make everyone happy and I'm the last what am I doing wrong why I have this newness and now my two children that's so sometimes say I want to jump in a river or something so my diet be helpful lately I'm getting tired about this world,1
"I can totally relate... I've lost so many friends and have pushed so many friends away because of the depression or the manic episodes where I get easily irritated.
No one gets it but a few of my friends who have similar mental illnesses. It's so tough to explain to someone who doesn't get it... I can't just shut it off, it'll never go away even with all the medication and therapy I've had, it still remains there, just waiting to pop up again. And granted, the medicines help, and therapy helps, but nothing can stop it completely and you're just so stuck trying to fight it off the best you can...",1
Hopefully she will get better and not worse.  I wish I had been on anti anxiety meds when I was a teenager and in college because anxiety and panic attacks are crippling and a lot of problems come from severe anxiety as a young person.,1
"All I can say that bye losing a girlfriend recently don't worry she didn't die she simply left me ,since that time including your truly heartbreaking story I now understand so much more ,believe me when I say to you thankyou and bless you",1
"Mine is different, but I relate. I go from suicidal to euphoric. When I am level (if you can call any bipolar level!), my mind still races, sometimes so much I can't sleep for days. When I am low I hide behind fake smiles and try not to go out much. In my manic stage I talk incessantly and I am sure some want me to shut up. I can't help it. I get anxiety and become agoraphobic for a while. I don't manage stress well, I cry a lot and scream when it all gets too much. I can now tell what most of my triggers are, and have a great network and coping strategies. I wasn't diagnosed until my 30's and still haven't got a number. I do get very upset with my head as I have horrible thoughts. Unfortunately I am also an empath so anything bad happening to others affects me a lot. I cope, I get through each day, and sometimes I shut down. That's life for me.",1
"They used to call it manic depression when I was young and didn't understand it well. I have a foster nephew who is aggressive and he has been diagnosed as BP4. It's a horrible disease and can be crippling for young people. It is so hard when your friends don't ""get"" your moods. I hope you find your safe place and coping mechanisms. Writing is one of mine, and I have 4 cats and 4 dogs. They help me on my down times. Bless you sweety, you have a struggle ahead, but we have people who will listen. xxx",1
"That is an amazing description and spot on for me. I used to explain the confusion as being placed in a maze, having  the lights shut off, and then being told you have 3 seconds to get out before you die. It's utter chaos and panic that at times can't be controlled even with medication, therapy, and coping techniques. Thank you for sharing!!!",1
I always say that dealing with my BP2 and anxiety is like fighting a three-headed beast. You never know where to start fighting.,1
I found it helpful to write down each day how i felt how my anxiety was how my depression was.  Then take it into your doctor with you so you can explain better how you have been feeling. Don't  give up.,1
"I have jars and jars of colored sea glass, it turned out to be quite a healthy obsession as it got me out of the house, into the fresh air and walking.  Every day at low tide I walked around the lake looking for colored glass that the tides had washed up.  I am sure people thought I was nuts (pardon the pun).  I did it until we had to move from the area and I do miss it however I have lovely jars that shine in the sunlight and my memories of enjoyment with this obsession.  We can look for ways to work with rather than against who we are.",1
I think I just a need to fill something that can't be satisfied.  I am a man of God so I say this confidently and as a person that struggles with mental illness that once you come to terms that earthly possessions and desires will never satisfy a person.  With well controlled med regime and a prayerful and God seeking life you can overcome the feeling of emptiness.,1
I went through the exact same thing.  I still have the clutter but I don't stress about it.  In a way it reminds me how I was when I was manic and to be more cautious about spending.  Also reading the bible and prayer have been a lot of help along with meds.,1
"Bipolar= reactions then thoughts most people think things through then react makes the end result a more logical act instead of an oh Shit now what! Vert poor at choice making. Have taken Anti psych meds ,anti depression crap everything from Zoloft to lithium to capacitance geoden zyprexa you name it ...depacote zyprexa ( fat pills) I gained so much weight and experienced a whole NEW LEVEL OF DEPRESSION THAT LED TO AGORAPHOBIA ..SEEMED I WAS JUST GETTING WORSE....BIPOLAR IS NOT EASY TO WRITE A SCRIPT FOR. THERE IS NOTHING MADE FOR IT SO THEY USE DRIS ADE FOR OTHER AILMENTS...ITS ALL hit and miss. Now I am on latuda ( mood stabilizer) topiramate ( controls seizures which I don't have )propranolol ( high blood pressure meds I don't have high blood pressure but I shake from the other drugs so it helps with that) prazosin (also high blood pressure med but it als controls the nightmares) this cocktail took me 5 years of trial and error but seems to do the trick. Have patience. We are all unique and for each one of us our cocktail will be unique too. Keep the faith and embrace your ability and outlook on life. So different from the norm. Never a dull moment.",1
I was on clozaphine if anyone offered latuda its new in uk just being used horrible drug made me so sick,1
Melanie Renee I'm struggling here lately and here's to hoping you are getting through okay!!!,1
I've been struggling too.   I'm driving myself crazy.  Let's hope we can get out of this funk!,1
Do not worry as min has done the damage to me just how she wanted and meeting on monday will make her really happy as then put one word or minute wrong iam gone she has destroyed me ad she will make it look like iam mentally unfit to do the job.,1
"To leave can be very hard, and it can be for some time.  Whatever you do, be safe first, and then surround yourself with people who will help you be strong and go through the process of becoming separate in your mind from him.  You can love someone and not be with them.  You can pray for him and not let him be able to harm you any more.  God is good.  Pray and read comforting Bible verses, go to church for comfort and to get strong and close to God.........don't be afraid, but be strong~ and be safe.",1
"I'm going through the same thing, finding out about his affairs triggered a horrible manic episode, which scared away all my friends. So now it's just him that I have. 

I really feel for you going through this but it's also nice to not feel like the only one.",1
"Sending love and this advice your way. You are strong, and as hard as things are, life can and will get better and be beautiful and amazing. As someone with anxiety/depression let me tell you that sometimes when you're in a bad place you get the 'blinders' put on you that only let you see the bad things and only see hardship and sadness in your future. But after time, work, and love you can and will be able to take those blinders off and see the wonderful parts of life again ❤️ make the decision that will let you be in an environment where you can heal. Sending love ❤️",1
"I think the fear of ""not having anywhere else to go"" is so often a sort of crutch that is used to stay in an abusive relationship... I think you need to take that leap and end it - the rest will get figured out, and I think that you'll find it's less scary and less impossible than it seems. Sending hugs and courage to you <3",1
"The longer you stay. The harder it will be to eventually leave. Do a little research on ""gas lighting."" Its a common way for one person to convince another that its all in their head. Then you feel like you are crazy. That is their plan. 
Know that approximately 90% of women involved in a toxic relationship will die by the hands of their abuser. At first I thought that number must be exaggerated.  The longer I stayed, the worse it got. I soon was fighting for my life on a daily basis. 
Don't beat yourself up if you aren't successful in leaving multiple times. The ugly truth is that the average person in an abusive relationship takes 7 times of leaving & coming back before they break free for good.
I was deathly afraid of my ex husband. Was afraid to tell anyone. It sounds a lot like this abuser suffers from Narcissistic Personality Disorder. People with Narcissistic Personality Disorder are  impossible to fix. This is because they don't think they have a problem. The best thing to do is hoard as much money (cash) as possible. Start making a plan now to get away. The best & only way to free yourself from a person with NPD is to have NO CONTACT with the person.
You deserve better. The cheating won't stop. Get out as soon as you can. Good luck to you dear. If you need to talk to someone that has been in your shoes. I welcome you to message me. Be good to yourself.",1
"I have, it started off ok but as it just stops the physical  symptoms I found it was no longer working for me. May have given me depression as a side effect. The Dr said I could choose whether to continue or not so now just take it when a panic attack comes on, works pretty quickly to stop them.",1
"I started taking it 4 weeks ago, have had only one pad panic attack that's it",1
I was started on it. It did nothing for my anxiety. I still had severe anxiety attacks while I was on it and was switched to xanax and finally got some relief.,1
"Worked well for me but nothing on diazepam but was took off of that after I needed 10mg+ to calm a mild panic attack and that would then cause me to crash and being a single Mum it wasn't good, I was on 80mg twice daily and it helped take the edge off",1
Helps a bit with physical symptoms but not great for full blown panic attack or when anxiety symptoms already started,1
Didn't work for me.. made my anxiety worse..,1
"Yes, started low & increase to three times a day, I have found, with perseverance, that side effects passed & it takes keeps day to day anxiety controllable, need something extra on challenging days though.",1
I have it and find it calm me down. Works pretty quickly during for me for anxiety attacks .,1
I'm on it at the moment. Twice a day. Still have anxiety but it has calmed it down. Haven't noticed any side effects.,1
"Its good that you are seeking help. Those memories/ flashbacks/feelings are not easy to talk about. You might try lining up some trusted friends/family to help you if you feel uneasy. Usually its a week or so until the next appointment. Make a plan. Call someone to come sit with you. Talk to you on the phone..once you've settled in to ""how it works"" it should get a little better. If you get on YouTube and search..what to do after a therapy session. It should give you some mental health tips..only look at the ones with licensed therapists or professionals.",1
I feel like talking about it helps you more I don't even have to talk about anymore my therapies at Soca my daily basic problems because it was really good to talk about we people they know my abuser and the more painful worse when my family didn't care even they know there was my brother he's a doctor a dental dr. And everybody knows him as a serious man in the community but because my family didn't support me he get away with but it's fine for me because now I'm leaving a better life but people that I wanted to understand and believe what I'm saying it was the witnesses that couldn't say nothing before and they support me not my family will people for my town they told me they know what's going on but they were so scared about this guy because he was the president of my country really close friend and Dominican Republic if you do something wrong you could kill nobody cares about it that's what I'm coming from I never went back to my country for almost 19 years let's talk about it with your therapist or anyone that is in the same situation is really good and help you a lot my God bless everyone of you to being abused,1
"In my experience, I was against 'opening the can of worms' and very frightened about facing my demons from the past, but now, five years on from opening up and twenty five years on from the major issue, I know it had to happen.  Never dealing with the issue properly means it just smoulders just below the surface, never going away, never being properly addressed.  Yes it's tough, yes it's painful, but I believe we can't truly move on and build a future until the issues have been faced head on.  The counsellor or therapist will be trained, empathic and non judgemental, they will gently help you through the whole process together until you can come to be able to process the difficult issues effectively so you can properly rebuild and regain your life. You don't deserve to suffer anymore X",1
"Sometimes we can be so afraid of things ""getting worse"" that we don't do the things that can help us get better -- the problem with ignoring trauma is what we won't deal with doesn't go away, it will only make things worse and worse over time. You can do this!",1
Would you look at that another phobia to top my existing ones   ,1
Truly didn't realize how horrible bi polar is I don't have it but my ex does good news is last I heard she's with a great guy stay healthy kat love always x,1
Scary,1
"I have all ready said to much, and now i am going to try and keep my mouth shut and see which works for me the best, crying and yelling ruined my 17 year relationship, and we are trying to to work on fixing it, and counsling is helping but i feel better not yelling and sceaming everytime i am upset, so maybe keeping my mouth shut will work for me I hope !!!!  WISH ME GOOD LUCK",1
Wisdom and knowledge are two different things. I am fighting with all my heart. It' the mind who is against me. My feelings are scary even for me. I must hide them. Otherwise I will scare people horribly..,1
Today went good. Although I   Avoided ppl/family to get thru with no explosions or break downs. 2 steps forward 3 back. But I am happy I wasn't in bed or stuffing my emotions w food.,1
EXACT SAME THING. I was hospitalized twice and they put me on leave during the second hospital stay and said if I couldn't get it together in a month they would have to fire me. I was too ashamed to go back to that job if I was going to be treated in that manner so I quit. I couldn't find another job for over 4 months and now we are getting evicted from our apartment due to affiliated late rent payments.,1
"It happens covertly to me  all the time. ""Normal"" people say suicide is cowardly, while they themselves are cowards in their terrors of the brave and unique individuals that we are.",1
"Don't worry ladies, I have just booted her from the page. She won't be back ❤ ~Dani",1
"I've been fired for being in hospital with kidney stones and having a week off.  I've also been let go for having a panic attack induced by trauma I didn't know I had.

In both cases the employer didn't care enough to say, 'get yourself better'.

Take their concern as a gift and use that gift to work on your mental health.",1
If they have you on medical leave and you will be paid then I would take this as a blessing. Don't stress on it but rather take this time for YOU and get better.,1
"Im 22, the mother of 2 autistic kids under the age of 7 and I have bpd, bipolar and clinical depression.  I wasn't forced on leave but I am on medical leave right now and honestly it's the best thing that's helped me so far. If you feel the need to go out and work I'd look around for cash jobs like yard maintenance or stuff like that and if you find yourself on a day you can't get out of bed.... well. Stay in bed guilt free. Don't stress about not being at work (I know it's hard as fuck) but try and take it as a break from reality and responsibilities and focus your energy on healing yourself.",1
My heart goes out to you. Nothing is more bad than your daughter telling you that you scare her. This was after fighting with my ex because he said he would pay for my meds then changed his mind...well I sorted that out... you have bad days don't crucify your self. Forgive your self...tell your self that you love your self... I'm also sick of fighting just to make it through the day... But the positivity in me won't allow me to give up...so darling you can't give up too. Xxx,1
"I don't know what advice will help, but know that you're not alone! We all know struggles like these, and most of us would hug you if we could. Hang in there, try to do something for you!",1
"For him and the guilt, apologize say it's not his fault honestly, it's not yours either, it's just the emotional roller coaster you go on. When he asks what he can do that will help (because he loves you and our partners always want to fix it even if there is nothing they can do) say something simple, say him being there and just listening helps (because it does sometimes), say sometimes you will just need a hug so you can cry (because you will), but if you are in a space where you can't be hugged it's not anything he should take offense of it's just sometimes it's too much stimulation and anything extra can make it worse. Is there anything he can help with that might help with some of the stress you are feeling?Just every day things? Maybe you need some extra hugs? Maybe you need just a moment where you are able to lie in his arms and just read or something? Maybe he could help with some chores (not sure of the dynamics of the household you are in)? Maybe you guys could go out on a walk together, somewhere where there won't be a lot of people and it can just be you two and maybe you dog or kids (if you have any), a simple nature trail can do wonders if you just get away from everything even for like 30 minutes.... it's not huge things. But it can help. It won't just help you, but it will help him feel better because he will feel like he's doing something to help you. Because that's all he wants, it's just sometimes those we live with don't realize they can't fix it, and it doesn't necessarily need to be fixed (though god we wish it could be) but just some simple things can relieve the pressure so much. I am hoping things even out for you.",1
"Remember you are not alone. Sometimes it just takes a little searching to find someone who understands and will help you and listen with no judgement. Remember you are a warrior, that though there seems to be more bad days than good, those good days are going to be brighter and better than anyone else in the world has. Because we warriors fight harder for those good days, we feel them stronger. You are a beautiful person, take a breath, breathe in relaxation and relax the stress as you breathe out. You deserve the brightness, so fight that dark away!",1
"I have to use a fan all year round, summer sometimes I even wet shirt, and sleep in a wet shirt, sounds horrible but I do what I have to do. I have been told it is menopause, but still have them after hormones",1
I take Effexor and that is one of the side effects. I have to use a fan. It was horrible for me last night when we lost power!,1
"Never be ashamed. I've been fighting bipolar and anxiety since 1st grade, and got diagnosed with it a couple years ago.
The best thing you can do is get help. I waited too long to get myself help, and it affected my life, my relationships, friendships, you name it. 
So I highly recommend getting help ASAP. Definitely see a psychiatrist and request cognitive behavioral therapy. They work wonders!",1
"I have not been in this situation, so I cannot recomend anything definative. My only words are..if youcan see a good therapist to work you through this, find a good lawyer to help your legal road ahead, find a therapist for your daughter to get her through this as well. Do not beat yourself up over the little things like dishes and housework. If you have family or friends near by see if they would be willing to help out, these are little things and not worht stressing over too mcuh (if your children are old enough enlist them to help, some of my fondest childhood memories are contributing to the home and helping mom clean house after saturday morning cartoons). When able speak with your doctor about any and all medicine concerns..you may even need to think about a psychologist for this (I never had good things with paxil, but diffrent meds work for diffrent people, and keep that in mind.).... and most importantly!....   YOU ARE AN AMAZING WOMAN AND STRONG MOTHER FOR PROTECTING YOUR CHILDREN!!!!! Do not sell yourself short on that, and do not sell your children short on any second guesses or wishfull thinking. Times are tought, but they will get better; thought  it may take a while. Hang in there. (also) being late for work, dragging through day by day, fighting to get up in the morning...these are understandable. Youv'e just gone through a shock. Again, if you can, therapist. Other than that, give yourself permission to have the 'bad days'. It happens even to the best of us. Talk to your employer about the being late if it is an issue, you don't have to get into details, but I've found most are pretty understanding when going through traumatic life occurances.",1
Yes I co-sign this. When you have extreme stress you may need a medication change or some type of adjustment. Sending you lots of love and light.,1
Sorry I have bipolar Disorder and severe Anxiety with Depression which is a Chemical Imbalance that I was born with soooo I Do NEED Medicine and I Feel for this Person's Situation,1
Hirap po pala ng anxiety ate,1
yung Panic phobia.      ,1
"You know what is worst...when you trust someone enough to talk about you struggle and they simply reply ""there are far more worst things in the world than what you are suffering from, get over it, don't act like a child!"" and then there is than tone in their voice and look in their face that are telling you that ""you are doing all these just for attention and you are lazy""            right now I am not using any medication but I feel like I am getting stupider day by day I forget most simple tasks like changing my clothes when I want to go out side or I can't tell if I am wearing a sunglasses or not...my head spins sometimes when I wake up I feel pressure in my brain sometimes...I am confused most of the times...",1
Keep you& kids safe first. You may also be if it from counseling. If something happens to you or your children . you run the risk of losing them. You can still try and help..from a distance. Until he decides to really get help.,1
"You are in a difficult situation and that is you are a  person who is being mistreating you, your husband is probably fearful of going to see a therapist as it is admitting that he actually has a problem. There is also the fact that you need to protect yourself and your children, if you do leave him again perhaps it may be a good idea not to go back until he has seen someone. Otherwise you will be going round in circles and there will be no resolution, I am sure you've thought of this yourself and I am sure you go back because of persuasion and the fact that you love him. Things will only improve when he has seen someone and received some help. I hope this helps you.",1
"I am in a some what similar situation, I left someone I care about a lot, but it just got to the point were the relationship was destroying me and my life. she is currently hospitalised, as cruel as it sounds it's given me calm and time to repair financial damage, but the amount guilt is unreal. 

I really do not know what else to do for her. She has 2 kids from previous relationship that are now with the dad, She's run up serious debts at the same time as emotionally (and occasionally physically) ripping me to pieces. 

Appreciate there's no benefit to you, but I can relate to a degree.",1
I would get a restraining order if he is abusive and make a request to the court that he seeks therapy and is on his medication before he can come home and has proof of completion before you divorce. If he doesnt then consider it. Also prayer helps. Forgive him. That's for you. The more u are holding grudges and are bitter the more the therapy won't work. Also get him the book bipolar for dummies. Make a family plan how to be a support system. Make sure he knows that his children are predisposed to bipolar disorder bc he has it but if the kids aren't showing symptoms they can reduce the chances of showing symptoms by reducing stress in the environment. Something is stressing him out. And it needs sto be addressed in a calm manner before his children are effected permanently by this toxic environment,1
Yes totally half of my own family just doesn't understand how hard it is 2 deal with this crap on a daily basis they just gave up on me and I'm so tired of being tired but especially when u already feel scared and alone all the time then your own family gives up on u.,1
"I suffer from anxiety and I don't want to die. I just feel like I hate this existence. Meaning everything feels so empty, so monotonous everyday same crap. Work/ Home/ Chores / Errands etc. having to deal with drama and problems all of that. People are so selfish and cruel I HATE IT! I gets me down, like why is life so boring and such a drag?? I'm not sure if I'm depressed but I know I lack fulfillment. Everything is just blah and meh... nothing exciting just one day after another. I WANT MORE out of life than this. We have ONE life why waste it working until im dead?",1
This has been on my mind quite a bit for the last several months. My elderly roommate is Catholic and elderly. Don't want her to find me with her husband dying three years ago...if I put a bag over my head or slice my throat/wrists. Having lost my vehicle because of a blown transmission and having to ride a bicycle to work without stroking out. I think about letting a car hit me...but wouldn't want someone to face that guilt the rest of their lives. I look at my job pumping gas at a grocery store and wondering how the hell I got to this point and if I can make enough to make it part-time when no one else will interview me. Being a Doctor Who fan (knowing he's a character on a TV show)...I wish he were real and to take me on one trip only...never to come back to this planet/time/place where people would want me around and to love me where I've never been loved before. No matter what I hear...no one would miss me...since I know no one...except for my roommate and her dog.,1
I get like this badly in the winter and mildly around my period. It's horrible,1
Unfortunately all too often. It is such a horrible feeling and I can never make it go away.  :(,1
"So much going on in personal relationships, financial situation, feelings of, "" They'd be better off without me to worry about."" How do you deal the best way for someone to heal, who is you're nearest & dearest, and your last reason for being alive, without destroying their future:?  :'(        ",1
"Yes I have been there alot and through out my life , I was always self harming , wanted to die , I even took it to the extent to overdose on some pill s for anxiety but u Kno w what if u get the right help ur thoughts will clear your anxiety will slowly down but seek help first",1
"I am going through a major depressive episode right now. Things in my personal life have blown up and I don't know what to believe anymore. For me I have begun to disassociate. I find myself just sitting and then my whole body feels just huge, bigger and bigger. Can't feel a thing. It is so scary. I worry some day I won't be able to bring myself out of it.

I'm trying so hard right now.",1
"All the time!!! And when you try to tell someone that, they get scared and think you're thinking suicide, but you just want a break from yourself and all the mental baggage.",1
"All the time. Its like my entire life is a battle. I have a wonderful hubby, but then I feel so guilty. Why should he suffer?? I have a wonderful son and a lovely daughter in law. I know I should feel thankful, but I feel like I drag everyone into this dark space.",1
I feel that well more or less he doesn't understand it like yesterday I started crying and it makes him feel helpless because he couldn't help me which makes him feel inadequate,1
"I feel this way also,  it seems so unfair that my husband has to be strong for me. I feel so guilty. It is an endless cycle",1
"And it kind of makes you feel like a crappy person when you think if others in the world who don't have a family or home or ect..i think it's best to know we all have our own struggles either emotional, physical, mental, spiritual we all have something going on and it's best to accept it especially with anxiety just sat you know this is a messed up feeling but just because it's today doesn't mean it'll be tomorrow",1
I only like it because I can relate like life could be so much worse and i actually have a nice life and amazing loved ones so why do I feel this way...and it really does make you feel guilty,1
I was never a religious person at all I mean I believed something was there but didnt know what and then I got appendicitis granted not the same thing as that and after that I have just been so anxious and i feel like God maybe used that experience to draw me closer to him because I started praying and asking for him...i haven't prayed in a while though and feel rather guilty about it,1
"Latelly ive been in this kind of state of mind. Im not emotionally strong and if something goes bad my Anxiety starts killing me day by day and my toughts of wanting do disapear and not exist emerges. Its sad and horrible but i know it will pass. Today i had an anxiety attack and all i wanted was to isolate myself and disapear.

Big hug warriors ♡",1
Sweetie don't worry English is perfectly fine trust me when people try to correct me over here I don't pay no mind I used to get mad but not anymore,1
"I'd sit here and say how sorry I am for you, but that would do you a disservice. This is your life. The hand has been dealt, it's time to call and show your cards. That's the thing though. Show others your hand. Talk about what hurts. Defining your feelings is difficult I'm sure. But you can describe the emptiness, the loneliness. And I'm not just talking about a therapist. Tell everyone in your life. I know how terrifying that prospect can be, but just think about it for a moment. You live with fear every day. Fear of your own thoughts, your urges or simply interacting with others. The fear here is being judged, but even if you were, would that really be worse? There's a saying, almost a mantra for us ""no one is harder on me than me."" So really, what damage can telling people how much your suffering and how little control you have? You torture yourself far more than any hurtful, judgmental comments. However, maybe, just maybe you'll find someone who gets it. Maybe your support system will grow. The people who get your pain but instead of telling you to get out of bed and deal with it, they lie down next to you and hold you. Sometimes love and support can be just as effective as meds.",1
"My cousin suffers from depression and when her attacks begins she texts me and I rush to her house even her husband can't comfort her she told me I am all her hope (no pressure) and I can only understand her I am kind of ok with this part of story but when I feel really bad and sunk into darkness of my thoughts and depression and am gasping for a tiny comfort then anxiety hits me...ad I text her she replies a day after or so asking if I am ok! why I can't do the same? maybe I am not compassionate as I think I am maybe I am just a selfish idiot who feel better helping others and is using that to feel good and are pretending that is good person? oh my mind is so complicated and are always up and runing creating ideas and theories I feel like it is trying so hard to explain everything that most of the times is mistaken I am too tired of thinking but I can't make it stop! I have a secret that is killing me down and it is that I am homosexual and no one knows...I feel lonely and really in pain, mental and physical I also have a nasty IBS that won't leave me alone, sometimes I think my problems are too complicated to be solved 1 by 1 I need a solution that can help me to start with a clean new state...",1
I can so relate to how Nemo is feeling right.  It's been a few weeks and the constant stress and lack of support doesn't help.,1
"I have been struggling myself lately. Here's my best advice to you. No matter what just try. Just try to get out of bed and meet with the sun. Take your D vitamins, and fish oil. If you get up and you just cant today. Its okay. Try again tomorrow. Just try. I personally askee people to keep their negative feeling and thoughts to themselves. I told myself to not speak negative even. Its hard, but it helps.",1
I have bipolar disorder when I hit a bad patch I just lock myself away I don't want to upset everyone just coz I'm upset Mt tenper is terrible as well,1
Dishes laundry mop.  Do whatever u can to alieve any outside stressors so that she can deal with the spiral head on,1
this is more like... maintaining mental health if you have it.... exercise is really hard when you struggle just to get out of bed. -_-,1
"Bipolar/Depression/Anxiety Open Page when you post images like this, can you please find ones big enough so they don't look so blurry?  Most of the images I see from this page are really blurry, I think because the original images are so small.  Thanks!",1
Your not! I'm down really low right now too because of my oldest kids. They always like to get me upset and stress me out and my anxiety just goes crazy!,1
"That's a tough one sweetheart. If you are over 18, you only need your parents support not permission. You should never have been given an intern only in the first place. They work under the supervision of licensed personel. Try to obtain information on the therapists they have and request the one you want. You may have to go through a few to find the right fit. Only you will know that -- if you feel uncomfortable, unsafe in any discussions, or see or feel no improvement. You can talk with your therapist or Dr about the need for hospitalization. If you feel time is of the essence check yourself in. They will usually begin and monitor any medications you may need as well as counseling and support from others like you. Don't be afraid. Also consider all the options in your area for treatment. 
If you are not 18, you need someone to talk to your parents for you as it doesn't appear that they see the importance of your receiving treatment. Maybe you have a school counselor, teacher, or another family member who can speak on your behalf. In my experience clergy and psychological treatment do not mix well. They are separate. Faith is very important. I cannot express enough how vital early intervention is to recovery!!!! The older you get, the harder it will be. 
Whatever you do, don't give up on yourself or others. I wish you the very best. Good luck!",1
Causes paranoia,1
"I do not have BPD (I was diagnosed bipolar 2 with many many other things), but I have a partner who may have it (though he lives somewhere currently where they have a horrible mental health system as are really bad at diagnosing so we aren't positive) there are some types of meds that help. Mood stabilizers are supposedly the select few that can cause some relief with BPD, but I definitely recommend DBT and therapy if you don't 
already. But until you can do it,  there are a lot of things you can do for yourself for now, find things that help you obsess in a positive way. I also write, but I write not only about what I feel but in my novels.(which helps be obsess productively) I also have my animals, which need constant care every day, and I rehab a lot of animals, so that helps a lot with giving me something. I am constantly researching about them because I enjoy it. There are many other things you can do just for every day stuff, walking or just any exercise. Yoga has been an extreme help for me. Just finding what works for you is really really important ^^",1
"One thing to remember is that you're NOT lazy. When I got to a point where I just couldn't do simple tasks anymore, I called myself lazy and just felt worse and worse about myself. Only when I found the right meds (or the right meds for now...) did I realize how much better and how much different I felt. I realized that I hadn't been lazy and that it was the illness attacking me with all it had. I realized that there was a difference between being sick (with the flu, etc) and having a horrible day with depression. When you're sick, you can get out of bed and take care of yourself. When you're in a low, sometimes you can't do those things and that's okay. You're alive and you're fighting to win, so always think more of yourself then the voices in your head say. You are not lazy.",1
First ask your self the question what is important to you. Have you always felt like this with your job. Is this a new thing. Is some outsides source contributing to your stress new relationship family drama. Do you like this challenging job? The best thing to do in a stressful situation is vent get it all out of your mind if there someone close to you to talk about this thing. I see a therapist so sometimes venting helps I go into that room with a variety of thing on my mind and come out calmer I don't have a solution right away but I am just less stressed. Exercise helps a lot even if it running for a short distance. Bipolar or not we all experienced high stress at work just bc you have bipolar does not mean your forced to be in a situation you should not want to be. Taking days off might give you an idea on how you will feel if you did not have this job. I text my self in a stressing situation so I know what was my triggers bc we easily forget what upset is then I go over it with my therapist. Changes when we have a mental condition can be more difficult to deal with as anxiety goes up depression episode might emerge. It's ok to be stress don't be hard on your self . I take medication so it keeps me balance. Sleep on your decisions you might feel differently the next day . We are only human and sometimes we are self are our worst enemies. Don't look for perfection it does not exist. One day at a time . We tend to think of tones of fake senecrious that are more like not to happen  . I wish you the best and I sure you will make the right decisions for yours self bc you know your self best,1
Its very common to struggle with work. I'm not a great employee. It doesn't take much to tap out.,1
"I feel the same way sometimes, i dont think people understand how hard it is having this bipolar disorder. Trying to function day to day can be a struggle. Our minds need a break.",1
"For me quitting means I am letting the bipolar win and I'm being a slave to my diagnosis. My work is what keeps me from being sent to a psych ward. Work helps to focus me on something other than my illness. Sure my focus isn't great and my work is sub par in my book I'm still being productive and keeping up to deadlines. Otherwise I'd just be sat at home dwelling on how crap I feel and that leads to a huge pity party for 1 and that's s place I just don't want to be. If you need to take a few days off as a break then do it. I have the next week off just so I can recharge my batteries. I have self care planned. Getting my nails done having lunch with my sister, going for a coffee date with my father and going shopping for a new mattress. Then the rest of the time I can sleep watch tv catch up on Netflix that kinda thing. With all that said I say just don't quit.",1
"You have made yourself a victim instead if accepting you have depression or another mental health issue and dealing with the positives as and web they present themselves.  Thus could mean doing something which makes you totally uncomfortable but doing it for your own self esteem and positive mindset. I am still on medication, I still shut myself away, I still shun parties and get togethers but occasionally I bite the bullet and so far by attending because I have made the decision to,do so, I have not encountered any major breakdowns.  Inwardly I give myself a pat on the back for achievement.",1
"I've often thought that having a mental illness separates someone from the rest of the world, I feel it's as though you live almost alongside people, but almost in a bubble, or a parallel existence, never really gelling or fitting in.  I'm trying to find the words to describe how it actually feels as I'm wondering if that is kinda how you might feel.  It's almost as though the rest of society is bubbling along and the sufferer is almost on the outside looking in.  Trying desperately to belong and be accepted, but never achieving this.  It's exhausting and sad at the same time as we feel cut off and lonely as well as different and misunderstood.

Finding people who really understand are few and far between.  I think only those who are suffering or who have suffered in the past truly understand, although of course those others who are really struggling have to put their energies into their own survival, unfortunately society as a whole doesn't 'get it'.  It is a crying shame that the world has little patience or acceptance of mental health problems or disability.  These two massive groups of people as still not treated as equals with very little compassion by the masses and Governments alike.  However much society tries to show it understands and is trying to support us, consideration and understanding comes far too short of the mark.  People haven't got time, everyone has their own problems, time management issues and lives, in essence it is each man for himself so those who may need extra help are left almost forgotten and left to cope essentially on their own.

Many people just don't understand mental illness at all, I'm not saying that they all don't try, because some do, but in a way, you can't blame them, mental health problems don't make logical sense to the sufferer quite often, let alone those who can't understand how it works.  My husband once said to my son; 'if you want to go to the party, why can't you go?' I.e. My son desperately wanted to go, but his acute anxiety stopped him.  So sad for him, but equally sad for his father who didn't comprehend why.

Sometimes the only true support can be found from like minded people.  Have you found any support groups you could visit? Other sufferers usually understand and don't judge.  In society we are judged, there are still stigmas and we can be regarded as different and therefore difficult, but infact it is usually the opposite, we are far more thoughtful more in touch with how we tick, more insightful, caring and understanding.

It is hard though to find the right people, quite often sufferers only end up with a very close circle of family and friends, I've lost many over the years, partly because people probably find me hard work and partly because I push them away and don't make the effort, never instigating social engagements, but often the people who stick by you through thick and thin are the ones that really matter.

Do you have any support in other ways such as medication or counselling, cbt etc?

With regards to the feeling of not wanting to be here, that totally makes sense.  Often it's the feeling of not fitting in, being so lonely and just existing, rather than living, to escape this unbearable and exhausting drudge day after day which is so awful, to escape this in the right sense is to get better. I think we all crave contentment and peace, but the long road to recovery can seem so far away and it can feel such a mountain to climb, but it is possible, a better life is realistic, but it does take a lot of resilience, determination and time.  Small, but significant steps are necessary, but can only done by putting lots of things in place, such as a healthy diet, sunshine, a little exercise, support from a range of people and professionals, possible medication, meaningful activities, but to start with just little and often, etc etc, it's almost like a plan, but it's not easy, but the results are both life changing and necessary.

Take one small step at a time, make achievable goals, which you can then congratulate yourself on, be kind to yourself, reach out to those who care, it is a sign of strength if you can do that.  We all deserve to find that inner peace, best wishes x",1

"This may sound stupid but the thing that has kept me going is comics and Superhero stories. Growing up, that's all I had to fall back on to feel better. Knowing that these people don't budge in the face of adversity was something I admired and wished I could be like. Not knowing what happens next in these stories because I'm gone causes me more distress than any problems I have. I'm so grateful for people such as Stan Lee for bringing these stories to the world and giving me something to cling to until I can hold my own.",1
"I now understand that just because I'm feeling suicidal or planning my own demise doesn't mean I want to die. Suicidal ideation is a symptom of mental illness, so just because you are dwelling on it doesn't mean you're going to act on it. Having said that, depressed people DO commit suicide so you need to have some strategies to help you through those thoughts. 
Seriously - if it were not for my kids I believe I would have opted out long ago... they lost their Dad to cancer as kids so I use that to remind me what it would do to them if I died by suicide.
I'm a Christian so I keep reminding myself its not my job to decide how & when I die... God has that sorted.
I have several close women friends I can call on if I'm feeling really dark... two of them have experienced severe depression so get where I'm at when I'm this unwell.
I have an excellent psychiatrist who is only a phone call away, if I'm feeling unsafe she will admit me into hospital until it passes or she's satisfied I'm safe to return home (I live alone). 
For some, distraction helps... I find this only helps if I'm well enough - have a list of things you can choose from that will distract you from your negative thoughts.
Mindfulness - Bring yourself back to now. Forget the past (too much rubbish) don't think ahead (too scary). Light a candle, play some [positive] music & just breath. 
Different things work better for different people... Hopefully there are some things amongst all these comments that might help. Blessings.  ",1
"I have struggled daily for years with suicidal thoughts. Every morning i wake up and ask myself if today is the day. I keep the local crisis line's phone number close at all times, i try to change up my routine even the slightest, i sleep for days straight, i will sit in a public place alone but still surrounded by bystanders, and i even just randomly visit friends so i am not alone. 

The worst thing when feeling suicidal is isolation. Being alone with your thoughts that only lead you in one direction is dangerous. 

Don't ever feel afraid to reach out. You don't have to be explaining why. Just do not try and work through it alone.  Be well.",1
"Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem I'm 18 and I have attempted to commit suicide. I've had thoughts about it since junior high, I was hospitalized 5 months ago, and I was hospitalized twice, so my first time was November 2016,and I was hospitalized in Tijuana, Mexico. They are not kind to you over there if you are a teen in the Tijuana mental health hospital. It sucks cuz I spent my 18th birthday at that hospital, then I got released November 16, then a month later I was taken back for aggression, so I was there for a month from December 12-January 12, so I spent Christmas and New years there, I'll never get that back and I remember the huge stomach pain of anxiety because I thought my life was over and my family was going to abandon me, but eventually the psychiatrist let them visit me and hope was brought back, I got out after like a week of that visit and then the second time of getting out of the hospital I felt so much more depressed, I was very open and honest about the intrusive thoughts of harming others or killing myself cuz I wanted to go away and the hospital would just tell me to control them and that the medication will work eventually. It didn't. So for the first time ever, I began cutting, I began to get threatened by my family and others to get the police called on me cuz of my actions and behavior that I couldn't control. I was like this for about two or three months after the hospital, I told myself I couldn't die, no matter how much I had urges to jump off the bridge as I walked to college or jump infront of a car, I just couldn't let myself die no matter how much I wanted too, so I kept going through treatment, it didn't work, the medication or therapy. So then in San Diego my brother and his girlfriend discovered DBT therapy and at the same time when I started my semester in college again I got help from the school psychologist and then I saw like two different psychiatrist and psychologists until they came to the conclusion that they didn't believe I had BPD like how the hospital diagnosed me with that, but that I did have severe OCD like they said, so this really great psychiatrist did a med change, and I immediately had my thoughts of suicide disappear, most of them and they didn't make me freak out anymore if they showed up. Combined with starting DBT two months ago, it worked miracles. I just finished my first official semester in college and I got all A's except one C, I had to withdraw my first semester from most classes and get an incomplete for one class so that's why I consider this semester an official one. I was really great for 2 months, of course not all days will be good, but I no longer felt like killing myself. Up until last week where I was very emotionally overwhelmed by all that had happened to me in my past and I dwelled on it and my mom is a very toxic person on me so I had a crisis and my impulse was to grab a knife and slice my throat, I couldn't because I was scared and the knife wasn't sharp enough, just big. And then so a few days later for the same thing of being emotionally overwhelmed I impulsively cut myself two days, but I talked about it in DBT therapy and I used the skills they have taught me and I got very productive. I promised myself I was going to practice my guitar every day starting this week and I already learned two songs. I write a lot of poetry that help express what I feel and I actually made a page because I want to make it into music and I have many designs to make clothing and I want to be recognized in the future by my writing and clothing and I want to be a voice of inspiration to others who suffer as well. So I always keep that in my head, that I need to grow and prosper and achieve my dreams and once I get there and if I make a lot of money, I'm gonna fund shit for mental health and keep on trying to be a voice people can relate to or get hope from. I want to prove to all the people that bullied me and treated me like shit and caused me trauma that I'm not just a typical whatever guy, I want to be someone big and successful, and I know my family isn't completely functional, but I can't leave them either, I would ruin their lives too. So I try to remember all that stuff and even though I dwell on the past a lot and feel so much hatred and anger towards those who hurt me who are a lot of people and all I ever beg for is an apology that I'll never get except for one girl, I use that as motivation to make sure that I'm going to prove them wrong one day, like Muhammad Ali ""I'ma show you how great I am!"" So even though I did hurt myself this last week, my thoughts mostly disappeared, I listen to very mellow music that makes me happy, I write, I play video games, I work out, and every day I try to achieve a goal no matter how small to feel that I am worth something and closer to growing bigger and closer to the person I dream to be. That's how my suicidal thoughts have gone away, but I lived hell for years, specially 2016 and the beginning of 2017.",1
"Suicide doesn't end the pain it just passes it on to someone else. I don't know who said this but its true. Yesterday was the anniversary of my husbands mother's suicide. She committed suicide one year after our marriage, I saw what it did to him. So even through I am super suicidal dealing with bipolar depression and anxiety, I just think of all the pain I have being passed onto my husband and three kids. So when it gets so hard to breath and I just want it to end, I think of them and I stay.",1
"I've come to the point where I realize that those thoughts are a just symptom that is part of my condition, and like any other symptom I try to address the source. I know the source is my brain chemistry, and that it's hereditary, and I accept that it's an illness/condition I'll have for the duration. I let it wash over me with the knowledge that it will pass. Some days are much harder than others, and some day I literally have to give myself permission to lie down and go to sleep. I find that sleep usually, not always, but usually, straightens out my thinking. Knowing what is is though, and knowing the patterns, and accepting my condition on its terms, and mine, helps. It doesn't make it easy, nor am I happy that this is my struggle, but it helps.",1
Suicide ideation can be  extremely scary for a person especially as the thoughts can be very vivid and often out with persons control. It   doesn't neccessarily mean that the person is going to attempt suicide - although not always case and I have in the past but mostly they are a reflection of persons emotional distress.  I've had times when these thoughts and images have been  almost been unbearable. I try and distract myself doing something  physical to get through. Unfortunate ly doesnt always work and I have resorted to self harm at times but not as frequent as before.,1
"My kids and meds. I won't lie and it gets easier but with support you can get better. Now I think of my grandson that I want to be there to meet. I realized I can't leave my children in this world alone. I have highs and lows but I just tell myself that if I'm gone my babies will be split up and they will be destroyed because I left them for reasons they couldn't understand. If you don't have kids just think about all the things that you want to do despite your ""darkness"" and how those things will never happen if you go through with it. Trust me I was sitting in my car on a dark road 2 weeks ago and thinking that I might as well because I was so tired of dealing with the depression and anxiety. Taking meds seeing doctors. But my children and husband kept calling my phone I could hear the hurt in their voices. I passed out I don't know how long but when I looked up I saw the lights on my husband's truck and I drove to to a stop sign and he saw me. Tears in his eyes I knew that I could not do that to my family. No matter how I struggle I know that they need me and I need them just as much.",1
"I use mindfulness techniques. Sorry for my english, i m italian...
I use ""zen""meditation  defusions techniques that is trying to separate from thoghts in many ways. You can say to yourself"" it's just a thought i don't have to do anything with it""; repeat the thought in different ways, slow, very very slow, fast, very fast, with, other voices, as imitating people... until the thought become a ""thing"" as another insignificant thing you see on a table... 
If you start breathing, as u do in meditation or yoga, than you can imagine to be on the grass, looking to the sky, and every thought is a cloud and you put it on a cloud and you see it go away... or always breathing, imagine to be on a bridge and under you , you see some  trains and those trains have their wagons. You put your thoughts on the trains like this: train of thoughts on the left, train of emotions, number 2, train of sensations (about body)number 3,...and you note what is passing in your mind and you take the thought, the emotiin or sensation and put it on the right wagon that is moving under your bridge.
Don't worry if you find on the train, that is you believe your thought is so true and strong and you are rapt from it and u follow it without putting an end... as you  notice this thing you gentle say to yourself :oh, i was on the train... or...oh... thank you miss mind or sir thought to rimind me to exist, but now i start back breathing mindfully and come back on my bridge and you on your train and i say you goodbye...
I ts hard and it needs a lot of practice, but it works. Zen meditation helped me a lot. But i need to be followed by some people who practice it, because alone it's hard, with a mental illness.",1
"Yes I actually attempted it. I put a belt around my neck and just let myself choke, i did it in the closet. Before I knew it I was on a stretcher on my way to the hospital. It was like 7am my girlfriend woke up to my cat meowing at the door very loudly, when she opened it she said she grabbed my knife and cut me down. I was out cold. When I got to the hospital, after a day or two, they put me in the psych ward. In there was where I learned how to cope and realized what my triggers were. I've had some good things happen since then but I still struggle with it daily. Stopped taking the meds cuz I just don't believe in them but I just hold on to all the positive thing I've done and keep trying to be more positive. I recently made a movie so I do my best to keep my mind busy",1
"I look at my children and my husband and everyone that cares about me and think about how not having me in their lives would affect their future. Sometimes finding strength is hard but you have to push those thoughts aside they too shall pass. They are temporary. Go for a walk or look into medical cannabis. Surround yourself with something you love. 
  Please tell someone you are feeling this way call a hotline or tell your doctor. There will be better days but please please tell someone if you are overwhelmed by these thoughts. Good luck to you. You are worth it.   ",1

"Keep in mind that I'm typing this without any kind of attitude. I'm not upset or hostile, I'm just talking. But that dude is 100% your biggest problem. He does absolutely nothing. Sits on his ass all day long playing video games. Up until very recently he sat on his ass all day long playing video games and smoking thetic, which he WILL do again, mark my words. You should NOT have to clean up after his lazy ass, but you do it anyway because you ALLOW him to sit around doing nothing all day. In a nutshell, you're an enabler. I'm not saying you don't fight him about it, but you've never followed through on a single threat you've made where he's concerned. Why would he wanna change? Why would he ever wanna try to be anything more than he is right now? Because he's got a meal ticket (you) snuggly tucked away in his back pocket. He knows that if he pisses you off, all he has to do is spit some sugarcoated bullshit in your ear and you'll fall back in his lap. He is a GROWN MAN, Amanda, and he's no different than your 6 (7?) year old son. Do you even realize how much better off you'd be if his worthless ass just left? How much extra money you'd have? What do you even see in him? Seriously. Cuz I could NEVER be attracted, let alone be in a relationship with someone like that. I honestly believe that if he had his way he'd lock himself in somebody's basement and do nothing but eat and play video games for the rest of his life. I've never seen a human being who lacked ambition the way he does. He's literally a potato. I mean the man wears your clothes because he's too lazy to wash his own shirt. Seriously?! YOU DESERVE BETTER!!!!! You shouldn't have raise a grown man, and he is NOT going to change. What the hell makes you wanna stay with him? I mean he does nothing. He flat out refuses to get a job, he steals your freaking bill money for god's sake, he doesn't care how he looks.. He doesn't even have the decency to clean y'all's home when you're at work. A home he wouldn't even have if it weren't for you. That's not love, Amanda. He's using you, and idk why you can't see that.

I'm the same way it feels I push ppl  away I tell way to much then it's used against me later. I have had 2 breakdowns since 2015.

Exactly I feel a lot of anger I'm anxious too. I didn't do much theses past two years I really let things go around my house w friends and family . But I been going on walks got a gym membership and mowing my own lawn weeding volunteering going to church hanging out w friends and driving again. I tend to lash out at times for little things I wait un till I'm booking over and end up ruining good relationships in the moment of rage. I'm currently in therapy once a week and am joining a traume therapy group next week. I was in intensive out patient for fourteen months were I learned DBT skills along w coping skills . I have all the skills to not get so angry but it seems they go out the window along w eating good and sleeping at times. I feel very overwhelmed in the mornings I have to drag myself out of bed I never feel rested my brain won't turn off. Thank you for sharing I'm very hard on myself and can't seem to stay out of my emotional mind. It takes over most the time. Your advise is very helpful. Have a nice day thanks again.,1
"I do a lot of over thinking-induced stressing too. And nights are definitely the worst. Nothing to do but lie there, mentally re-living every traumatic experience you've ever had over and over again in your head til you're ready to either cry, or physically hurt someone. I've never had a major breakdown I don't guess. Just little ones here and there when I get really angry or too overwhelmed. Rage has always been my biggest problem, but I've simmered down a LOT in the last several years. Learned how to control it. I've always found physical actitivities to be the most helpful. Mowing the yard, cleaning, just staying busy. As long as no other people are around, of course. lol. I'm not a good ""peopler""",1

Give yourself permision to say no to people if not feeling up to it.
Learn what joy is.. get the book one thousand gifts, read it if you can, it has helped. Have faith you can do it... I do not know if you believe in God but he has helped me.. and I had been lost for many years.

"Yeah, I was diagnosed with everything I have at a very young age, so maybe I just wasn't mature enough to receive that particular diagnosis. Does Bipolar Disorder often get confused with BPD?

"Yeah, my mom was a nurse and my dad was a very liked, very well-known high school football coach. And since I was the furthest thing from a stereotypical coach's daughter (a straight-A student, member of the student council, etc.), I was basically the family embarrassment. My parents cared a lot about appearances and what other people thought, so heaven forbid if I ever opened my mouth. Mine was rarely a popular opinion. For example: A girl was killed in a car accident at my high school Jr year. She was just one of many students who had died in less than a decade at that school. Student Council (her friends) discussed the possibility of building a memorial for her on the school grounds. I was the ONLY person who stood up and said that if they built a memorial for her, they'd have to build one for every student who had died at that school. That it wasn't fair to commemorate the popular girl and just forget all the others like they didn't matter. Boy did I hear it when my dad got home that afternoon. He storms in the house, puts his finger in my face and tells me, ""Her friends can build a memorial for her if they want to, and you better damn well keep your mouth shut about it."" I never understood that, and I don't think I ever will. If my daughter stood on her own and risked being hated by everyone she knew doing what she believed is right I'd burst into flames I'd be so proud",1
"This is so needed for students and parents. The reason I say parents also is because my 12 year old daughter was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and and she was cutting herself I found this out through the school consular, thank heavens for her but, one of my daughter's  friends mothers found out and her daughter is not allowed to be friends with my daughter anymore. This hurt my daughter very much. I think parents need to be educated about mental illness and realize that it is not contagious.",1
"As a NAMI volunteer I got to go speak to 5 different middle school health classes! About mental health, how I went from agoraphobic to going to a university- it was a blast, we also explained the different illness and where to get help! Though I am graduating tomorrow with my BA in business, I actually want to enter the fiction arena with the truth of mental health. Showing positives and some negatives that help us overcome! We are a special people, smart, creative, and HELL OF A STRONG GROUP OF PEOPLE. We have to be, we fight our own brains everyday. When I was told I needed a heart transplant this year on my 42nd birthday actually.. I smiled and said "" ok now where do we start, so I can get better!"" I know depression. This caused me to be angry. I am back to training for my second degree and my instructor certification. The only thing that stops me- is... me. Now I do listen to my body, I have more breaks and don't push it. All that is through mental health and the struggles I had with it. Three doctors told me I was stupid! I wish I can find them and invite them to my graduation when I get my BA!! Lol",1

I'm lucky I live in the U.K.  We have the NHS which we pay for through our taxes. We don't have to pay to see doctors or for hospital treatment. We do have a charge for prescriptions for people that work. The unemployed and very low income earners get them free. Although we pay a fee it is still cheaper than paying privately. Our government is planning on privatising our NHS so that will mean we'll have to get health insurance. And things will probably be the same for us as yourselves. This really frightens me. I bet the insurance for bipolar patients will be sky high. I feel for you. It must be terrible not to be able to afford the treatment you need. I am so lucky at the moment. Hope you can get the help that you need soon. We need our medication. It makes life almost bearable. Good luck ❤️,1
"I'm the same way , it was so bad that I paid some one to stay the day with me if my husband or kid couldn't come over . My husband has been working from home now. just so I don't freak out . I feel the safest in the er too been there so many time cause I thought I was having a heart attach or I was going to die I have seen 3 phycologist, 2 physiatrist and was  told I suffer from a form of ptsd  , was put on meds and I use meditation for anxiety to go to sleep too . I found the meditation on u tube really helps and a phycologist that deal with hypnotherapy . When I suffer panic attack even if someone is around me I do gardening or anything to keep my thought busy which is hard when your in an attack. You will be told to accept the attacks let them pass . They can't kill you just take a deep breath count to 4 . release the air count to 4 slow your breathing down . Tell your self that this too shell  pass. Hope that helps a bit .

"Hey,
I'm so sorry you're going through all that. That sounds heart wrenching, especially with the added stresses of day to day life with both chronically ill and energetic children! You sound very strong, and like you lead with your strength. I'm sure your children admire the fierce example and light you give them, and would undoubtedly miss you if you were to go. You could visit your oldest and encourage him to have a meaningful life, in or out of prison, and try to survive together for a while. 
That being said, your life is yours and you owe it to no one. I hope that in lieu of mess you're taking care of yourself in other ways, journaling, making time for walks (I always love river walks, the water flowing makes me feel like I can move/breathe when I'm feeling dragged under). The whole ""dark times pass"" thing is bs, but I find that if I tally up small moments of joy or feeling ""awake"" during the day, they help balance darker thoughts. 

To answer your question, thoughts all the time. I do think there's a difference between suicidal thoughts ""I can't do this, I'm not strong enough, I want to just die and fade away, my loved ones would be happier if I were dead,"" and suicidal ideation ""here's how I'll do it, I'll cancel this appointment to do it that morning, sitting about to then walking away then going back, writing letters with a time in mind, specific."" I get more scared of the latter, even if thoughts are common",1
"No one texts me , with my meds I dream way more at night . I have no one to be awkward around when I isolate. Who cares who gets pissed off ... always wish I could fall asleep normal",1
By the way laugh away!  I am very aware of depression and anxiety illness.,1
"I don't have a lot of money but what I do make sure to do is order my groceries online from shop rite when I'm having a down week. It's about $15 extra for them to shop and deliver it but it's worth it if otherwise you won't have food. I would get cheap stuff like ramen and cup of soup, maybe try to get some protein shakes because lack of protein can cause problems with serotonin (I just read something about that the other day.) a good goal would be to try to go outside to get your mail every day just so you see the light of day. Or even just open a window. It's impossible to think about, but those things might help.",1
"Totally agree. Causes tension in the family, strain in every relationship",1
"yes the lack of support systems like ""family"" comes with hand in hand with the illness ... ignorance really plus a strong fear of ""it couldn't happen to me"" .... you knuckheads .... jaja",1

"I the only reason I post this kind of stuff is so that people will understand depression better.when people hear the word mental illness,they shy away from you,afraid they may catch it.It is not contagious.I won't hurt you,i won't start talking crazy things.I'm just me.,,,,.,,,the same as you",1
"I've been running pretty much ever since bipolar first started to get ahold of me when I was 17-18. I go on long runs, about 8 miles. I built myself up to that over time but it really helps me. It helps me with that manic energy, it gives me 1-2 hours to also let my mind go and run through the restless thoughts. Afterwards the endorphins that we naturally produce from a good workout help me feel much better and accomplished. Running was originally my own form of self harm, with the thought of 'if I collapse and die then that'd be a way out' and ran to the point of exhaustion and muscle cramps. But over time what was an unhealthy habit of self harm turned into a super positive daily routine of using that time and energy to focus my thoughts and emotions in a productive way to start my days, it keeps me in good shape, and has been a cornerstone of my mental health and overall well being the last 6 years. I've also done things such as rock climbing, hot yoga, biking. Anything active that requires you to be in tune with your whole body really really helps me",1
"I was so glad to read that you were able to get some help! It is so hard for many of us to reach out and say we need help. Those who don't have BPD have a hard time understanding how our brain is wired and how our perceptions can get in the way. I am so grateful you were able to find a group that you could relate to and then individuals that you could connect with! We need those things in our lives. 

It helps me so much to be able to talk to all of you here! I am struggling right now and feel very much alone.",1
I am so glad to hear you were able to connect with a group and then a few individuals! This is so important. Isolation is not a good thing. I am struggling with this myself,1

Not the guilt Kim ❤,1

"Also, I did this last summer with my boyfriend's son, it's called time out bottle. I called it a snow globe and did as an art project with him. You mix water, clear glue, and sparkles in a water bottle and mix it up. The idea is for them to shake it and watch it the sparkles settle while they sit in time out. When it's down, they are down and calmed down. It's really actually  calming. I did one in one of those tinny airplane alcohol bottles to keep in my pocket book for those out in public break downs.",1

"Ignorant people can sometimes be willfully ignorant. Please don't turn your back on your faith due to these people's sin of unkindness. Find a church where you will be loved for who you are, flaws and all. My depression and anxiety make it VERY difficult for me to walk a joyful, triumphant Christian life. Someday you'll find a church like my family did, where a woman who publicly shared about her suicide attempt and subsequent hospitalization is now in a lay leadership role.",1
"I am a Christian and yes, I would be hurt, offended and very upset by someone saying that to me. Run, don't walk, out of there! It does not mean you have to give up your faith, just that that particular church is not for you. I am so very sorry you had this happen to you. And, there is also no way to cleanse the mental illness out of your DNA. Those people sound very uneducated and judgemental.     ",1
This is a poisonous and dangerous point of view and it does nothing but shame somebody who is bipolar. Well shame on anybody who has said that to you shame on them,1
Holy crap Marc I'm shaking,1
We really do struggle.,1
I do everyday it's a struggle.,1

I am one that struggles and battles that world. I know though I have seen people suffer tremendously worse than myself .",1
"I'm an Apostolic Pentecostal and I recently went back to church. Unfortunately I listened to several churches that brought me to the altar three times trying to throw the ""demons"" out of me while my three small children watched fearfully. I am not possessed. It's not the devil. I am a returning Christian and I will also tell you that I found my church by interviewing pastors first. I found a great one who understands and does not do that. You may have to seek out a different church. Pray about it and I will be praying with you. In Jesus Name!",1
It is totally disturbing.,1
"The devil has nothing to do with your biology and psychology. This is the kind of abusive rhetoric that made people fear epileptic people and condemn them instead of helping. Stay away from that church, they are not rational.",1
That's horrible and rude of her.,1
"I'm not a member of this group but saw this post as a friend of mine is. As a Christian minister I would be embarrassed to hear any fellow church leader refer to any mental illness in such a way. As a church we are not perfect but we try to support someone with any type of mental illness in the same way we would someone with a physical illness.
I'm actually attending a seminar next week on pastoral care for people with mental illness as being equipped to help people who are suffering is a key part of what we are about.
I'm sorry you were treated in such a way.",1
"It is why I belong to no organized religion. When the church told my father I was a whore for allowing my uncle to get his kicks out of bouncing me on his lap (I was maybe 3??) And surely more so when I asked why was there blood in my underwear after a visit with my cousins! Age 6 or 7?? 

So no, people who believe this kind of vudoo thinking are only clinging to irrational and harmful beliefs, in my opinion. It holds back our humanity",1
"I am a Christian. I attended a Pentecostal church for about 6 months. The preachers wife, who did most of the preaching on Wednesday night's for whatever reason, said during a sermon pretty much that ADHD and bipolar didn't exist. Her nephew had been ""acting up"" and was diagnosed with ADHD. So I caught her after the sermon and asked her how she can say something like that when there are scientific brain scans that can be done to show the physical difference between someone with a normal brain as opposed to someone with bipolar. I mean I get her not believing her nephew had ADHD because he was only 6 or so, but to blatantly say bipolar didn't exist rubbed me the wrong way. Her response was they have has several people in the congregation that were bipolar and that through prayer, they were healed. I looked at her and said well then they never had it to begin with, and walked out. I never went back. 

I know have been attending a different church for over a year and the pastor knows I'm bipolar, and he knows that there is science involved in order to keep me stabilized, because my pastor is a rational thinking man. He doesn't try to convince anyone with any disabilities that simply praying will make it go away. He prays for and with us when we struggle, but he understands it won't just go away.",1
"Don't trust people in the ""Church"" That is only a building, an institution. Trust in the Word. I had the same dilemma but here it is  Psalm 118:8
""It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man""  the church is just a institution but the real church are believers in Jesus.    I know some people might not believe, some here are atheists etc, others might ask why the Lord would curse them with a sickness. I myself has struggled with this. I suffer from Bi-polar too and have done some crazy things during mania. I don't believe in the church as an institution at all. I do believe in Jesus. The only way. Human sickness is because the flesh is fleeting, it is manifestation of our sin. It is flawed and degrading due to our sin, since the exile from eden we are no longer in His image.  There is no cure for our ailment YET. But keep faith, it has helped me in some dark times.",1
"I am attacked by bipolarity, PTSD, and others. Psychology does not believe in demons possession, but after 18 years of therapy and medication I finally tried exorcism. I feel the best I ever have! I am still on three medications, but I am down from six!
Some mental illness is a chemical imbalance, and others are clinical as you know. I believe now, that clinical mental illness is really demon possession and should be treated as such.
Look at the man yelling while walking down the street. He is not just ramblings. There is a subject and a verb. Someone did something, or didn't (God maby)and he relives this over and over. He can't get past it. Mary, the Government, husband, etc, etc. These people are Hurting and you don't just tell hurting people to ""get over it""
They are believing lies, and need to hear the truth!
Maby there should be some kind of combination treatment combining Faith, Reason, and a little medication until maximum improvement is achieved. I was on lithium for 15 years and all it did was make me numb to life! I could feel anger, love, fear, or joy!
Is that Healing? No",1
"I think I agree with you Carol. Mental illness requires a holistic approach. You need encouragement in terms of Biblical upliftment, medication and therapy. I believe its vital to anchor oneself especially as mental illnesses bring about anxiety, self-doubt etc etc Also lots of self-love, positivity and a cherished support system are necessary.",1
"There are some that feel prayer will cure cancer. That scares me a little. I liken it to ""you wouldn't tell a diabetic not to take their meds but you shun mental illness?""",1
"I probably should ignore them but I don't . I flat out tell them they are wrong and that way of thinking is damaging . And if they don't believe in doctors they should keep it to themselves . I always associate it to blood pressure pills and cancer treatments and tell them to go to those people as well with their ""praying it out """,1
That's horrible. I'm sorry you went through that,1
"Yes, I have been told this before. Sadly, by some of my own family. They kinda get it now. There is also an unspoken thing that other Christians believe it is because of a lack of faith in God. I have learned to try and avoid those people. God has brought me some people who understand, or at least try to understand. I pray that God will send you someone like that. As far as church right now... idk. I haven't gone in a while. Im not exactly sure why. Partly sick of the masquerade. Pray about finding another church that will welcome you with open arms, if that is what you feel led to do.",1
"15 years ago I leave church Protestant coz call me anormal the younger brother and sister and make me cry always and I say I come from Protestant baptist and I m
NoT new Protestant coz I raised n serve to God in my old other church before and they say how u know bible I say I study missionary and be leader before in my other church 
But more be unkind to me this Latin Protestant church I got upset n decided to leave church and Protestant n still my life outside but I still belief in God 
Coz I start not go this Chruch any say hello and all my life start hard and mistake and get a very traumatic and bad experience I end with mental illnes and eating disorder but I don't think I can go to church where I can be open and help me
Where is the love of God the preacher ?
When I try to be open in the other pastor about my trauma say forget and forgive to who hurt u when u was kid and u sin will be forgive and maybe u play quija or have a satanic familiar and I say no I don't have that 
I m good person and I was just a little 5 years old little kid be victim of something traumatic happening to me
Nothing to help nothing nice answer and nothing to heal say go to say sorry and forgive the person who hurt u and u can be better and pray more and u need more commited to God

Try and remember that depression doesn't last forever. It will lift eventually lift and you will have some  peace.  It is a brutal disease and I too have struggled with suicidal thoughts and I know how bad they hurt. Stay strong never let bipolar win.,1

I know how you feel I also have a daughter that suffers bpd and it so painful to see her struggle. ~S~,1
This is me most days. It's usually something stupid:  your work colleague giving you a look. Your manager criticising your work. Then the black cloud appears. It's hard to shake off. The obsession with turning the words over in your head...it's painful. You just feel fragile....,1

Keep this in mind for anxiety/panic attacks to help ground you back in reality",1
Some stuff id say is anxiety. Some id say is laziness lol,1
This means so much to me thank u for getting this. I suffer from depression and anxiety and PTSD and I am also bipolar.,1
As frustrating as it is healing takes time.  As you have pointed out yourself if you go too fast you risk making the recovery process  longer or even  permanent damage to your knee. Just take things day by day.,1
"Love my latuda, I take a higher dose so I do take it around bedtime but had to go off of it do to running out and noticed a big difference.  Inderal helps my anxiety, I take 10 mg 3x a day, but am more able to do normal things without panic attacks like run to the grocery store. Latuda did make me gain weight but that's the only side effect I remember. I think it's a great combo",1
Weight gain on latuda I only took it for 6 weeks while in the hospital . I was extremely tired but was also  on Depicote and clonazepam  saw my doctor after I was released and he put me on back on my old meds Zoloft clonazepam Doxipen Remeron and lamictal I'm been tipping and a bit manic due to be back in the real world and daily stress.

"This is where I am right now. My marriage will be over in 6 days. His anger and spitefulness are overwhelming.

I told my best friend this via text that I could t handle calls so please text or message me. She then would text and as soon as I relied she'd call.

"Please, please don't give up.  Don't let this awful illness beat you.  So many questions which you don't have answers for.  We need logic in our lives to make any sense of the world and ourselves, but mental illness doesn't often make logical sense.
E.g. We can often feel alone, but push people away etc. I guess I would need to ask lots of questions to help you answer some of yours, but I think our minds are such a complex organ and just like others in our bodies it sometimes doesn't work as we want it to and sometimes it can't cope.  At certain times in our lives some people need help.  I'm not sure whether you are receiving or have had any support from family or professionals or have help in the form of medication, therapy, etc.  
I remember at my lowest points I felt my head was constantly on fire, it's exhausting (no wonder you feel always tired) and escape from our thoughts can feel so welcome, impossible and/or necessary.
You say you ve struggled for four years.  That's one of the worst things that it can go on for so long and feel as though it can take forever to get better.
I felt it wasn't living, only existing, not a life.  Why? A 64 million dollar question.  The answer; probably due to hundreds of small things and quite possibly made worse by some notable bigger things.  I'm sure study could have been really hard, the discipline and energy needed may well have taken its toll, but once it was over your life changed, possibly exciting in one way, but scary in another as your secured your job. I don't like to second guess as I don't know, but just trying to look at possible triggers and difficulties.  Beginning a new stage of life must have been challenging.
Why anyone has anxiety or depression at any point in their life, if only we knew, but the important thing is how to get better from here.
Plans are great, goals are good, but they can also seem insurmountable, too big.  On good days we might feel we can conquer the world and make wonderful plans, on bad days getting out of bed is a step too far.  Plans I think are definitely a good idea, but they also need to include smaller, achievable, but significant goals.  Do your friends understand? Are they supportive?
Yes, 'always anxious' sounds familiar, when we struggle, it can be one long round of constant anxiety as you aren't well, it makes sense if you aren't at peace with yourself or content.  
I believe we all ultimately want to get better to escape the quagmire of self pity and crap we are in, but it's to find that way forward, one step at a time, don't lose sight of those plans, but also it is necessary to be realistic and accept that it isn't going to be easy.  Hold onto the hope that it can get better, lean on those you love, tell them how you feel and let them help you, life can get better.  Take good care, be kind to yourself, you deserve a better life x",1
"don't give up...get a good psychologist and learn to manage the mood swings; before being diagnosed (and getting help), I went thru a period of months realizing I didn't have to say more than 12 words a day, only to find I could cut it down to six!

Have you spoken to anyone, including a Dr, about how you're feeling right now? If not, can you do that before you resort to self harm? I know it's hard... I've lived with a variety of mood disorders since my early teens so appreciate how you're feeling. I encourage you to take the first step  & find someone you trust that you can share your struggle with. Blessings.  ",1

Now he is getting a little better, more involved wit us as his family, I have read n keep reading about how to make him feel part of everything we do. Lots of vitamins,minerals, no tension in our home no negative arguments all positive, lots of love hugs n reassurance that all is going to be ok. As a family we may not know how to deal wit new things tat happen to our loved ones but the best way is to educate ourselves find therapy, counseling,  a dr tat will take u under his wing n do wats best for u. Always try hard to be positive n when things get difficult go outside look up to the sky day or night n Pray, have Faith n Believe tat God has a plan for u n no matter wat is happening he already knows ur going to be stronger then ever.",1
"For me, bipolar makes it hard to leave things in the past and get rid of baggage. Lets be honest- maybe I don't want to. BUT, I'm learning everyday even though I've been dealing with this for 20yrs now. It never stops being hard. But it does get less hard. Don't worry about what you missed. Worry about how it's enriching your life to be able to put the pieces together. Hope this helps.",1
Yeah I feel that way .  Confusing and then disappoint. And then depression...mania....lol. I only laugh cause what else can I do. Everyday I try to be normal functioning.,1
"I think for me, when I finally got my dx, it took longer because I was flighty, I would quit before they could tell me what's wrong, because I didn't want to hear it, and well, mental illness doesn't exactly make consistency easy. But I stuck with it a few years ago, I had gotten out of a horrible abusive marriage, I had 2 boys counting on me, and I just knew I didn't want to be me anymore, whatever that was or had been. It's taken a long time to get to where I am, and I'm still a long way to where I need to go, but I am further than I've ever been. I don't regret waiting, because everything happens for a reason, and for whatever reason, I wasn't ready, and living in what-if will drive me mad(der). If I knew I was ""so screwed up in the head"" I would have never had kids, I would have never lived any of the experiences I have. The thought of not having my boys, is beyond comprehension, they are my salvation at times, they are the one thing I've gotten right in life, they are what gave me the strength to get out of an abusive marriage, without them I wouldn't be here, so an earlier dx would have prevented them from being born.",1
In 2014 a Dr. Prescribed those to me and although I already shake bc of my anxiety those made my shaking worse. It was embarrassing. I saw a psychiatrist a few months later and he told me that the Dr. Shouldn't have precribed me those two together... He put me on effexor klonopin and trazadone and my shaking almost stopped. Good luck hope you can find something better.,1
Wellbrutin made me shake. I'm on Zoloft clonazepam Doxipen Remeron lamictal and Ambian as needed for insomnia. Took me 2 years to get right. I'm getting mine upped since  im tipping a little up the lamictal is at the lowest dose need more .,1
I used to take Wellbutrin and would shake.,1
Don't b ashamed of ur illness,1
"Tell these ppl they have no clue what they are saying or talking about! And that Bipolar is a far more serious issue then even jus an array of emotions at one time. Did u know that Bipolar also causes serious physical health problems?! Ask them if they know that!?! Tell them they need to be more educated on sumthin b4 they go shooting off at the mouth! And u don't need to tell them it's u that suffers, tell them u know many close ppl that do... not that u should be ashamed at all!!! That's like being ashamed that u have a limp or other defect from birth. U cannot help how u were born, I wear my bipolar proudly! I am exactly how God made me!",1
"I think this is a great question! I always call people out on that but I do it discreetly so they don't feel embarrassed. Plus they usually listen if they don't feel threatened. I say something like, ""I know you mean no harm by that but please take a moment to consider your listeners- maybe they have a loved one with BP and using mental illness as a joke only perpetuates their feelings of isolation."" Be kind to them and respectful and you'd be surprised how many positive responses you'll get    good luck!",1
"I know it upsets me so much. It's very irritating. But I have to calm myself down and educate them. Not that they ever care because they will tell me it was a joke. Then I educate them some more. It hurts yes, but there is still a lot of stigma on mental illness. It will take a while to change the world. But you can educate one person at a time",1
My daughter and I are bipolar. We make statements like this often to each other. Only when we are in private amongst each other. It is our way of trying to find humor in such a horrible illness. Gives us a reason to laugh and understand at the same time. We suffer sever depression with ours and the moods swings. So when we can laugh its great.,1
"Don't be ashamed. You've done nothing wrong, nothing to be ashamed about. We just are who we are. 

As for them? There's no educating the ignorant. Just keep stepping. Do you.

"Hi,I'm not bipolar. I have suffered from anxiety ,depression and ptsd . Soooo I'm with you. Would these same people use the word ""retarded""?!?Maybe ask them.We know it's not correct to say that. Some people need to be alerted to other's feelings .",1
Don't feel shame that only allows the illness to win. If it bugs you say something!,1
I am going through this right now. I have trust issues and the guy I'm with now I've known for 16yrs this is our 3rd time trying in a relationship. We love each other imensly we have each others backs but it's my insecurities that push him away everytime. I try so hard not to question him about stuff but if I don't it eats me up inside and drives me crazy. He's trying to deal with it but I see its going to push him away. I can't stop what do I do can anyone help me please,1
"Its out there. You will find the one it just takes the right person. I was married for almost 9 years. I loved her in the beginning but I had suspensions that shut my feelings off. The hardest thing I ever did was not fallow my manic urges till the end. I always thought she was cheating. Turns out she was. Sent me in to a uncontrollable manic state real quick then a deep depression I'm still stuck in now. We been separated almost 2 years and divorced just over a year now. She still my friend but I have to be careful because she now how to use me against me.
The good news is some how in the last year I have stumbled across a wonderful women that has the patience of a saint and a heart of gold. She has not push anything and lets me do me. She has helped me heal and grow. I know realise I am going to be ok with proper support. We decide to start merging our families in to one big family and moved in together. She has showed me its ok to love again. I call her my sunshine because she is the only person that can brighten my day with just a smile. I'm scared to admit it to her but I have fallen in love. A love that I have never felt before. A love that scares the holy hell out of me. She always tells me, ""It's ok Al. We don't need to rush. I love you and I am here and will always be here. Your mine and I ain't letting you go again.""",1
"Yep and I truly don't care right now. I'll be 42 in a few weeks, never married, no kids. But, I've decided to only focus on me and having a baby myself (thru an IUI with an a anonymous sperm donor). I'm not giving up on becoming a mom due to not being able to find a ""good man"". I feel that my BiPolar is NOT to blame. The only way in which I can remotely see its role is that I am very ""all or nothing"". And also, I trust NOBODY, and will go to great lengths to make sure my man isn't lying or cheating on me. So, I can become obsessed with that, and am an amazing natural at playing detective. I have had tons of past serious relationships, but sure enough, my instincts were always right on and I'd catch them in huge lies all the time (and some cheating!!)",1
I feel the same way. I just started seeing someone n really fkin afraid that my anxiety n depression would scare her away. :(,1
I feel the same way I have a big paranoia that past relationships were better than having me and easier and happier than being with me I feel too crazy I feel mean at times when I snap but can't change it and I always think there's someone else it sucks and the hard thing is trying to figure out if it's our head thinking up crap again or if it really is how you're thinking it is however in saying all that Im a strong believer that there's someone for everyone to love,1
"Yes 100%, This thought is a major player in my depression I'd love to be in a relationship have kids etc the whole deal, I am 34 and can't shake the feeling it's never going to happen now even though I want it to more than anything in the world it sucks :(",1
There's hope I have Bipolar borderline personality and anxiety as well as thyroid disease and hypoglycemia and I've been in a relationship 16 years now never split up believe me I'm a roller coaster to live with and he's a saint for dealing with it but we stay together and we've both only kissed another person once and we talked it over and neither of us have been unfaithful since,1
Same I always feel staff don't like me paranoid but I can't help it... I am going for my second attempt at CBT ❤️️,1
"I have been in a relationship for 6 years with my bp boyfriend and i can tell you it hasnt been an easy road!! Honesty trust and most of all communication is essential as well as an understanding of his illness through reading posts like these. He has his own room, therefore his own space for whenever he needs it and i respect his need for it. Im slowly developing a thick skin for his hurtful words and actions when hes manic because i see the great person he truly is beneath his fears, phobias and anxiety and try to reassure him and help keep him grounded. So far, so good...
Don't give up on love, the right one is out there waiting for you xxxx",1
I've been married for 2 and a half years and we have been together a total of 6years and known each other 8 years. My mother and aunt whom both have varying severities of BP and Anxiety plus eating disorders have been married over 24 years. Just need to find the one whom can deal with / help you through the crazy.,1
"I'm glad I had the opportunity to have been in a 20 year marriage, I just wish he'd been strong enough to have stood by me to find out what was wrong with me. ((I was diagnosed during the divorce, but symptoms were there for many years). Now, I am afraid no-one will want to deal with my issues, not that anyone is even looking to get to know me without knowing about them. So, I figure I'll grow old and die alone.",1
"I've been with my boyfriend for almost a year. Before this relationship, I didn't think I would ever be in one - I didn't even want to be in one. From the very beginning of our relationship, we were both 100% honest with each other. He knew about all my struggles and I made sure he understood that our relationship will not be easy. It takes a lot of communication, especially right now because we are long distance. I think communication and honesty from the get go is key.",1
Yes. The saddest part is that while things were good I fell in love with my now husband. I'm not doing well anymore and the poor guy is stuck with me. I can't stand to be around me and he tries really hard to understand my mood swings and need to be left alone but unless you've been were we go mentally you can't understand. I feel so bad for him! He never would cheat... doesn't mean I don't worry that he should find someone that could gives him what I can't. He deserve to be happy. You know? And I can't be that !,1
"Same here jessie 
And everthing in my life i lost because my fear.   Only my job",1
Yep!!! Been with my man for 2 years and just today I think my fears have been somewhat settled.. My biggest fear was never being loved because of my brain. He's saw some dark things inside of me.,1
Number 1 without a doubt! 8 hours sleep I've not slept for 48hours now I'm shattered but my mind won't switch off   ,1
"1, without a doubt   ",1
2 without a doubt   ,1
definitely number 2. Always feel overwhelmed when it comes to cleaning the house. Be nice if the house could just tidy up after itself :),1
"2, no hesitation.",1
2! No questions about it. Cleaning is one thing that gets my anxiety acting up real fast! And arguing with my kids to get them to help clean only makes it worse! So definitely 2!,1

"I truly know how you feel. I was recently diagnosed with bpd. I also have ocd, depression and anxiety. How do you handle everything? I feel like im drowning half the time.",1
"1 without question or hesitation. Anxiety and chronic nerve, joint, and back pain keeps me from getting decent sleep most of the time.",1
One. And four on high anxiety days.,1
I think I would struggle with two,1
A definitely a. Cleaning is a chore but I have certain days I do certain tasks which helps keep it from overwhelming me and my kid is 16 she can feed herself. And I'm way to particular to let anyone else run my errands (i won't even let people fold my towels lol),1
2. I struggle bad during the lows to keep my house maintained. Would be so much easier to not have to worry about it.,1
All the time too scared to let anyone know what is really going on in my head too scared to let anyone in because I don't know how they will react or how they will treat me after reading what is going on in my head,1
"If you can't do some exercise but have you tube go on there and find jason stephenson guided meditation to anxiety, go and lie down close your eyes and take some deep breaths in through your nose for say the count of four and breath out through your mouth for the count of six letting go of all that anxiety.

I've had severe depression severe anxiety and ptsd for the majority of my life. I gave birth to my beautiful baby boy last Friday and now I'm pretty sure I can add post partum depression in there. I've been on meds but I feel like they aren't working anymore. I have a doctor's appointment next week for it but for now I just feel like I'm spiraling. My husband is trying to help but I just can't stop crying. I love my son and I'm loving having him I don't regret him I don't wish him any harm.

I am terrified of the future because of my past. everyday is a new day but when most of the past days have been shit it's very difficult to accept that the coming days will be better.

"Many times in my life I was a "" go getter "" I went to college early away from home ,adjusted and adapted and joined the friends and crowds . I've been engaged to 3 different decent men and I have never had any children . I became a nurse at 21 and I've been married , help raise my ex husbands kids who grew up wonderful. I divorced my husband after five years and moved back into my parents home .  In 13 years of nursing I've worked at four places and agency and I Try to stay at the same place as long as I can . I'm comfortable where I am working and who I am today at 35.  im not afraid of failure anymore; atleast not as much as I used to be and daily I do my best to stay on the right track and achieve. However contrary to popular belief I like to be alone and not visit unless I'm very comfortable around someone and that's the problem perhaps . I lay the cards out right away because I figure people will know me truly that way . I've always been "" ok bla bla this is me abt questions "" I cannot explain my anxieties.

Because I can still feed my baby daughter breakfast every morning I am very glad that I did not die. Of course, in desperation our reason and logic and our vision can all abandon us.

Inside of yourself.",1

I'm afraid of dying. The fear of the unknown. When I'll die or what happens when I do. Keeps me up at night often.,1
I have bipolar 2 and I didn't feel a big change until I started taking lithium. I still take about 6 or 7 different medicines in addition to that and they all work together to give me the best results possible. I did get lithium poisoning once which was horrible but the doctor just lowered my dosage and I was fine. I go for blood tests every few months to check lithium levels. I really started feeling like a person once I started the lithium.,1
Night terrors can be brought on by certain medications. I get them sometimes and need to take a diazapam with my sleeping pill/mood stabilizer,1
"Hi Liz.  I So hear you about being tired of going back and forth to the doc and playing the trail and error game.  As hard as it may be to play that game, unfortunately it's about the only way they can find the right combination for you and Your body type.  Each one of us is different in how our bodies will react, so it's hard to say what will work for you.  It can take a long time to find the right combination, but it's not just about the meds.  Please as Anne stated, work at finding a Team that can help you.  This includes a psychiatrist, your family doc and a Therapist, and other supports as well.  You talk about the nightmares and night tremors.  This is something that you can work with a Trained prefessional on, with CBT, or other forms of therapy that work for you (again, sometimes trail and error, but worth it).  In my opinion and experience, it was only when I had a therapist that I Trusted and could really open up to, and be able to talk about the reasons for my PTSD, that I was able to slowly get the nightmares, terrors and body memories to get less frequent.  Hang in there, and continue to work with your Team to find the best treatment for you.",1
Hi Guillermo. I have BPD and Bipolar 2 with anxiety and PTSD. I was fortunate in finding a therapist on the referal of a thrapist I knew socially. But I think a google seach may be in order for you. Google BPD and it may bring up a sub search of therapists in your area.,1
Wow do I understand this. I know what it's like to be bipolar with manic depression and anger issues. That was wrong for him to push you to get to that point. After two years he should know that stop means stop not just for your health but because it's not good on either one of you for you to get that upset. I know when I'm angry I don't always think through what I'm saying  and have been known to say things that hurt  not meaning too. I'm just going to throw this out there if you ever need anyone to talk to message me I will gladly be the ear that you need with nobody else will.,1

"In the last ""42"" years I have had two therapist that I felt close to, connected with and trusted.  They save me more than once from self harm or worse.  It helped to be able to talk to them.  I no longer have them and I can definitely relate to being disconnected and feeling isolated.  It is a horrible feeling that no one would ever understand unless they have experienced it.  I now realize after all of these years that I will just have to except that I am alone in this respect and continue to be thankful for the blessings I do have.",1

"First stop being ashamed.. would you feel shame if you had cancer? When people say something like that just know they are saying the weather is having mood swings.. wet dry cold hot...it's not actually directed or meant as anything. I have lived with this for 45 years and I've learned it is part of who I am and I feel no shame, but not from lack of trying to shame me from my mom. It's just who I am and I have enough triggers without letting ignorance of someone else be another. Next time someone says something is ""bipolar"" respond with poor weather... poor wash machine you have no idea what they are going through and laugh it off. Don't be ashamed of the illness it makes us very special. We are talented, artistic, and all around extremely intelligent people. That's nothing to be ashamed of.",1
"Thank u to everyone who has responded. My mother's advice was ""to take the high road"" and not let it affect my day. Easier said than done.  I would love to educate those who use the term so lightly, but speaking up is something I have never been good at. I have only opened up to a few people about being diagnosed with bipolar2 and BPD. I have alienated every friend I have ever made because I could not handle ""the pressure"" of friendship. So now I have made a friend and she uses the term bipolar for anything from her hair to the weather. I try to laugh it off as ignorance but deep down it makes me feel imperfect and different from ""regular people"".

 I take mood stabilizer 's and use cannabis for anxiety but still have those underlying symptoms to struggle with. I have family that loves me but they will never understand the battle I am fighting with myself. I guess I will have to learn how to love myself before I try to make friends, and learn to let the little things go. 

I am thankful that I am not the only one feeling this way but it's a rotten feeling to feel ashamed to be me. Keep on keeping on. Much love from Colorado.",1
We have borrowed the term from the English language to fit the disorder. Not the other way around. I am an electrician and polar and bipolar are generic terms we use. When I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder I understood it very clearly because I connected it with the electrical term. I wouldn't get upset because when people are saying it they most likely are not comparing it in their head with bipolar disorder one or 2. They most likely have a different picture in their head altogether then you are imagining. I hope this helps,1
The thing that gets me upset is that the ones who say it are usually the ones that put up the mental illness support memes on their Facebook page.,1

Don't get me wrong not everyday is a cake walk. I use to be on Lamictal, and it worked wonders. With that being said research the drug closely.

"Bipolar II, GSAD and hypomania, depakote, 250 mg/d, and paxil (15-25 mg/d, depending on what is going on in my life). I need the depakote to flatten out the cycling and the paxil to keep the anxiety under control. It seems if I can keep the anxiety under control then the depakote can hold me steady. If I let the fear take hold then I start back up the hypomanic train. The trick for me is balacing paxil dose with stress....",1

I'm struggling with routine as I am studying and can't seem to get my head in the game when it comes to sitting down and hitting the books. But I will keep trying. And always keep fighting.

I will have a look into that. I'm sleeping an average of 3 hours a night. And I'm so scared I'm going to go manic. On another note.... have you tried DBT? It really helps with the bipolar. It did wonders for me,1
Liz Stjepanović I was on lamictal and I noticed the same thing .. My mania was more frequent and my depressive was so bad I had myself committed .. I agree I think maybe a change in meds will help but I am in the same boat as I am struggling as well ..

Oh yes I heard that also. Something about lithium levels needing to be tested regularly because if they're too high they can cause severe health risks?,1
May I ask how well lithium works for you? I take latuda and risperidone but I am also struggling and I was Diagnosed in 2014 so ive had every medication for bipolar there is but lithium and my Dr suggested it but I've heard horrible things about it so I'm just curious on how well its worked for you .. Thank you   ,1
"Depression is not just ""feeling down"" talk to a professional.  You've described some of the major symptoms of depressive disorder and an anxiety disorder.  I wouldn't suggest self diagnosis and I would suggest educating yourself on what major depressive disorder actually is and it is not feeling down or feeling sad as well as anxiety disorders which is where the overthinking worrying and panic seem to be getting to you.  You should try seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist if possible.  Good luck it's a long confusing battle but we can all do it!",1
"What you described is what I suffer with on a daily basis.  Ib have rapid bipolar,  severe anxiety, bpd, and ptsd.all of which can be life threatening. Do not stop til you find someone that will listen to you. Sometimes you have to go a little bat shit crazy for them to realize the severity  of it. That's what I had to do. Let your raw emotions out on them ib know that is a very vulnerable feeling to have to do, but sometimes it is necessary for them to see that something really needs to be dove to help you",1
Sounds like my symptoms which are depression and anxiety. On one medication for each. Menopause made my depression a lot worse leading to a change in antidepressant.,1

I'm a Christian, but sometimes I worry, fret, & over think to the point that I'm unable to think straight, then suddenly, I realize that I haven't actually stopped & asked God to help me.  At times that's really all i'm able to do is ask Him to help me.  He hasn't failed me yet...as long as I give Him my burdens & then trust Him with whatever His will is...He loves to hear me ask, He loves it when I put my faith & trust in Him",1

"I was on the same med combo...is the effexor xr(long acting) if so try taking it at bedtime...it can make u tired at first so u r in bed at that time if u take at night. Trazadone is older gen drug with tired as a major side effect although it has a ""window"" where its easy to fall asleep after tat if u miss your window u can end up a bit anxious and wired...so again take 30 minutes before bed and then get into bed after taking both meds and do something relaxing (cup of chamomile tea, reading ..whatever works 4 u). After I started taking both meds at bedtime I was much more functional during the day. One caution.300 mg effexor is just over therapeutic upper level I know cause I used to take that dose...and it can be hard on the liver which can leave u tired so ask to have liver enzymes monitored regularly. This wasn't done 4 me and I've had liver problems because they didn't monitor this properly. Also u might want to discuss swapping Trazadone with remeron soltabs at bedtime. Talk to your doctor. This drug was better at promoting a restful sleep each night which in turn helped me cope with symptoms during the day. Just my experiences...if anything helps I'm glad. I sure understand the misery when it is a challenge just to get up and go to the damn bathroom!...let alone keep on top of anything else that turns us into functional depressive patients.",1
"Hi fellow Canadian here have you tried looking at programs available in your area for people with your illness? 
 I have found we have to be the people who fight for our own health. I had to go to a woman's clinic and walk in doctors for a year trying to stabilize my bipolar because my doctor got very ill and when I got sick she had just gotten sick as well. So I have had to really learn to navigate the system myself, it's not ideal but I am sure that there is a doctor who can and will listen to you and help you get better.
Also have a full blood screening done you may have a under lying health condition that need proper treatment as they can also effect how your mind feels.

Also if you have bipolar you are taking effexor for depression is not ideal, as it can cause mania and that just makes the lows worse I find. Something to treat the anxiety is better at least thats what my doctor explained to me(I was on previous to treat lows and it made me worse)",1
"Another Canadian here. I found there are resources out there that arent used because no one refers to them. Check to see if you have a mental health and addictions intake centre or a mental health resource clinic in your area. 

Don't be afraid to advocate with your doctor either.",1
"my daughter is going through the same thing. It's so hard to watch! We recently had a genetic test done (google GeneSight Testing) that tested her DNA with over 500 psychiatric medications, including antidepressants, mood stabilizers,   and anxiolytics. It turns out that most of the meds she had been on weren't able to be metabolized by her body, so the meds never worked. They gave us a report on the meds that WILL work, and now she has hope again. It might be worth a try! I think of all the years and money spent on medications that never worked, and all the time she's endured the depression and anxiety, waiting the 4 to 6 weeks for the meds to work, and they never did. I'm sorry you're in this dark place too right now. I hope things start to get better for you, and thought this might be a suggestion for you to think about. Good luck <3",1
"Jocelyn Bryn  also good advice    ""oh shift"" is a book that I've read. Shift your way of thinking.     I'm no reader at all but have anxiety, depression & stress.. this book was a good read",1
Daily struggle,1
I have severe anxiety disorder and take paroxetine. I've been on it now for 12 years. I only take 20mg. It really helps me. Best advise is to let your doctor know that what he prescribed doesn't work.,1
"I stopped taking medication. I learned that you control you're own feelings. You want to be sad so be it, if you want to be happy then be happy. Stop dwelling on the past, it's behind and done with. Focus on today and look forward to tomorrow! All these medications are killing you slowly anyways, hell if you read the side effects to all of them... You'll notice 99% of these things say causes depression, so you're depressed and your going to take a pill that has a side effect of depression?, You're going to let some little pill control Your life!? 

It took me 2 years to get off seroquel due to the withdrawals I had. I was dependint on some little pill to make me happy and sleepy. 

Now I'm off it, feeling amazing! And losing weight! Damn thing turned me into a over sized watermelon. 

Now I know not everyone is the same blah blah blah bullshit. 

Don't make an excuse, If I can find happiness than so can you! 

If you realllllllly need to take something for you're aneixty, then smoke a little weed, if it's illegal in you're state or country who cares, get that shit! It's hell of a lot healthier then those pills. 

Mind you this is my opinion so don't get all you're panties tied up in a bunch and attack me :)",1
"I've been on Almost every drug there is Since I was diagnosed in 2005. I felt hopeless in finding something tht would work,  but ten years ago I was prescribed Seroquel and Citalopram and to be honest with u I would recommend it to anyone. I don't want ppl to go through wat I went through. So plz give it a try tell ur Doctor to start you off on 100 mg of Seroquel and 10 mg of Citalopram, than progressively move up.  I have anxiety at night so I take both of these at night and I wake up fully refreshed! Dnt be discouraged if you get real sleepy with them at first, it takes a little while for your body to adjust to them.",1
"You might have to start on a smaller dose of seroquel. The lowest dose is 25. I only take a small dose but it is helpful along with my other medications which includes Prozac for depression, anxiety, and OCD and a good amount of mood stabilizers for my bipolar disorder.",1
I just started it recently. Does a great job as a mood stabilizer but afraid of weight gain.,1
Feeling like you are bringing everyone and everything down regardless of thwir assurances that its not the case.  Putting life on pause to find the right med combo and feeling guilty for that on top of it.,1
It's the Meds well known as they cause uncontrollable eating apparently they trick the brain into thinking you have not eaten,1
"Thank you so much for your reply . Luckily I have a friend that will be taking me to and from the gym as my anxiety is to high on buses , or I get easily irritated with people . Well done you for what you've accomplished. That's a lot of strength and commitment. I'm just coming out of a bad patch so need to get active again . I'm not sure I could go veggie lol like meat to much . Thanks for your reply",1
I really hope you aren't trying to be demeaning or minimizing our struggles..,1
It seams unless you you have depression or anxiety no one knows wot it is like on a daily basis,1
"And incredibly paranoid, OCD, aggressive, irritable, unreliable, hypersexual, suicidal.....",1
"Sadly Im with Matthew on this one, My daughter has Bipolar disorder and I constantly see the Crazy irrational. Anti social. Angry. Impulsive. Hurtful. Flakey. etc etc behaviour, no fun for her or me :'(",1
Crazy irrational. Anti social. Angry. Impulsive. Hurtful. Flakey. Prone to fabricating situations in the mind based off of very little evidence. And although we know the situation is not real the feelings associated with them are. But yeah. I'm nice and funny and social sometimes.,1
"I do it too, but not much help because when I'm in the middle of it I'm not aware it's happening.... I just irritate the snot out of everyone around me",1
I have non epileptic  stress seizures from anxiety does anyone know wat this is an has anyone had one you go into space can't talk to tell people wats wrong stroke symptoms first time I was hospitalized for 3 days they had to intabate me so scary now wen I feel it coming on I take alprazolam and go in the bed,1
"Be open minded about it.  I hear there's been great success using EMDR for your issues, but you need to open to exploring and don't do anything you're uncomfortable with.

"I struggle too .... and it has made it alot worse to fight the black dog they call depression and sadness as my mum the reason for my Bieng , took her own life on the 10th march 2017. But she did raise us to be strong and that is what I am counting on , my strength ❤️",1
I feel you. I finished cosmetology school last year and ive had one job then was fired after a month. Since then ive been spiraling almost to the point of wanting to see a psychiatrist again. Ive been med free 8 years and too scared to go back. I wanna get an evaluation done and go through my medical records and see if my diagnosis is still the same of if there's anything new. Im finding it hard to call places back that i apply to and i find it hard to even get my career going. I cant live at home with my parents supporting me forever. Im a damn trainwreck and somehow i manage. I still wanna live even if its exhausting.,1
I am with you. I am rapid cycling right now. I have a new dr and is switchin everything around. And im going thru some serious life changing bull shit. I am so tited of everything. I just cant deal aanymore. Its so overwhelming. Idk who to even talk to any more. I did talk to my wife. But now...im too bipolar for her. Its just nuts....so i feel your pain. Hang in there. Thats alaa we can.do. best wishes.,1
So i called the dr and he wanted.to see me.asap. now...well now i am here and just overwhelmed whith anxiety and nervousness. I havent slept in 2 days. And im sorry. Shit just sux right.now people. Thank you for letting me rant....,1
Just don't be discouraged!  Take one minute at a time than one day at a time. There is no use of stressing for something we cannot control and no use on stressing on something on tht hasn't occurred. Just some food for thought  ,1
Well I had such a horrible feeling today so anxious. But I remembered what you wrote. And guess what I feel so much better. Sure tomorrow will be more positive....,1
"Us with Bpd put more pressure on ourselves bc we think more and stress more than normal ppl do. I'm on Seroquel and Citalopram it works great for me, I get a long nights rest, it will help you.",1
"I would never wish my illness ""BPD"" on my worst enemy! I'm daily struggling and fighting my negative thoughts with positive ones, and once I do tht I feel tht I have given into the negative because now I feel I can't change this spiral but instead have incouraged it. My thoughts consume the way I feel on the outside, I feel tht I'm constantly chasing the good days I recently had before to make me feel better instead of feeling lost. BPD is never a cure bc it differs from one day to the next and can change at any moment and anything can trigger it.",1
I take doxepin at night along with prozason. I am bipolar with high anxiety PTSD.  I do o.k.  pray you find peace.,1
"I was put on prazosin 2 months ago. This medication is a blood pressure medication. Yet they found it helps some people with nightmares & sleep problems  (usually do to PTSD).
My dr told me to pay attention to how I'm feeling while taking it. I don't suffer from high blood pressure. Therefore I had to make sure it wasn't causing low blood pressure. I found I couldn't tolerate taking it every day. It made me feel worn out & my heart was doing overtime. I experimented a little with it. Now I only take it when I don't have anything important to do the next day. Taking it daily wasn't working at all for me. The longer I took it. The more tired I became & eventually my blood pressure was too low. It can be a good drug for some people. I recommend monitoring your blood pressure & lack of energy. I hated it when I took it daily. Now that I don't take it every night. I really love it.",1
So sorry that you have to struggle like that some times it's not fair,1
"I have anxiety, depression and ptsd and they put me on Prasozin and I saw an increase in my night terrors and sleepwalking. Last week they switched me to Trazodone and it seems help...but the hangover affect sucks.",1
"I have Borderline Personality Disorder and Bipolar I. As Borderlines, we wear our emotions or hearts on our sleeves. We protect those who we dearly love. And if you make us upset, you'll know it quickly. I have severe trust issues, if that tells you anything. I don't take criticism very well either. BPD is caused by a traumatic event at some point in our early lives. You have to be a strong enough person to handle someone with BPD. We can be quite emotional. Borderline just means we feel anger, hurt, depression 100X worse than the ""normal"" individual. We can say things that we don't mean if we're upset. And those things can be pretty cruel at times. This is the ""I hate you, but don't leave me!"" mental health issue. I'm just being 100% honest here. If you can find a way to calmly talk to us, then a BPD relationship is for you. If you get upset easily, nah... it won't work. My husband has been with me for almost 13 years now. It can be done if you communicate effectively. We can be quite possessive of the people we love. And when you've done something wrong, we have no problems cutting you out permanently. We're epic at silent treatments. It's like we need to protect ourselves from feeling that pain from that traumatic event again. If we sense there's anything amiss, we're out of there. Psst... But we love sex (at least some of us really do)!  ;)",1
"I'm on board with honesty and trust...without which i don't think you have any chance of making it work. I have BPD and ""bipolar tendencies"" whatever the he'll that is LOL my partner of almost 20 years has bipolar disorder. We tattooed trust on ourselves in someplace we see at the beginning to make sure we never forgot our commitment to making it the foundation of our relationship. Then we spent the next 20ish years being completely honest with one another. We might not always like what each of us has to say but the honesty helps keep things transparent. These disorders will complicate your life enough...don't add anything else in the mix that would confuse or complicate the relationship. That being said you can understand the demons each other faces better than a ""healthy person"". You can sympathize with the issues your partner faces. You'll be proud of their success because you'll know what it cost. The only thing sometimes you'll have to put a disagreement or discussion off till later because when the disorder is running the show u can't have a rationale conversation. U have to wait till your partner is back in charge to have some talks. I wouldn't want to live without my bipolar partner. I'm grateful every day we were willing to take a chance on us! Love Always !!!

"Hello everybody, my name is Dan. I suffer from depression & anxiety. I've had counselling & it comes back to abandoned issues.
I've recently come back from the states after being with my fiancé for 10 weeks.
She has ""something"" but hasn't been diagnosed yet. 
I'm not going thro the good & bad times we had but she was having such a negative impact on my life that I had to call it off & would remain friends. 
I can't do the friends thing after being intimate with someone. I've tried for the last 2 months & she isn't the person she once was. Weather it's because of the change of meds or whatever, I slowly got no answers to questions & finally not even reading my messages. This is day 2 that I haven't messaged her & she hasn't messaged me. It is very hurtful but I'm not ""cutting"" or planning suicide. (2 attempts) so I am doing well even if I don't feel like it. 
I guess just enjoy your dates, make no future plans, enjoy their company while your with them. 
........
If I read this back to myself, it probably won't make any sense... but I tried to help somebody else out & that's going to be my happy thought for the day   
Everybody, regardless of what you have or haven't got, I'm a person that doesn't judge you... all the best to ""y'all""   ✌️   love&peace... from little New Zealand     ",1

Thnk U So much for the caring and kind words. Unfortunately my father was not a good man he was an alcoholic and would beat on my Mom and younger sister and I hated him for tht. I never have a good role model growing up so tht is why I think I am doubtful of being a good dad bc I never had a good dad to teach me about morals.,1

Fear can really mess with our lives...It has been awhile, sometimes it's best to let sleeping dog's lie...I don't know the situation on the other end, but I can & will pray for you..Sometimes people don't or can't understand what other's go through until they experience it themselves...You can say all the buts and I woulds, truth being y'all don't know...God bless you!",1

"I have bpd and from my own experience I need a lot of attention and love, if I don't get it I can slip into a bad mood which ends up turning into a whole lot worse at times! I need a lot of listening and understanding even when I'm babbling on about stupid small things. Lots of hugs. I take a lot out on my partner at times. When the world hurts me I get upset at him and he's gone a very long way to figure out what to do with the situation and what not to do with it. We still struggle at times and as far as we know he doesn't have a ""disorder/label"" like we do to add to the mix! It takes a lot of hard work but it's so good when you do get to a point where you both understand enough about each other to not affect each other negatively ❤️ the best part about your situation is that you can get each other on a different level with your experiences dealing with your conditions! And you can take your meds together which is always a bonus as I forget mine too often hahaha. And always remember that things said and done can't be undone so a but of space between the two of you is a blessing as long as it's communicated to the other properly ❤️",1
"I have taken it since August 2000. Twice ended up in hospital due to toxic poisoning. This last time, cold turkey, high dose and just had it stopped not ""weaned off"" as should be.
Awful side effects, literally felt electric shocks all over inside body, then painful after shower drying myself skin so much pain. Felt sleepy, really dopey, feeling like spaced out! Scary didn't feel in control at all! Off altogether then restarted on small dose for just over a week then dose doubled and some symptoms came back, so now back to low dose!!!
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to get bloods checked properly, mine weren't and Ill through no fault of my own!!",1
"Hmmm, my meds fucked me up. I've been on tons of different medication and each time I get worse. I currently off of meds and even feel worse. (If anyone has had a med that works let me know.) I've been on prozac, celexa, wellbutrin, Lamictal, lorazapam, ambien, and even lithium. None have helped. I've even had the anti-anxiety ones such as Xanax, but NOTHING helps. I might be a hopeless case.",1
"Hi. I have Bipolar 1 as does my sister and mother. I remember back in 2012 when I was convinced my teeth were falling out, I could feel every single one of them moving when I spoke, when I ate, the only way I can describe my mood throughout that episode was utter terror. All day everyday I didn't eat, I examined my teeth, I went to 4 different dentists and 2 GPs (before diagnosis ). I ended up trying to ply them out if my mouth until I was sedated with diazepam . The only way I 'coped' at times was to distract myself with painting . I can't explain it but it really helps me...don't get me wrong the anxiety creeps through ALWAYS. .... The other day I was on a low, I got really overdramatic about the price of fags and how it's not fair to do this to me bla bla bipolar blaaaa...anyway I made this through spite and it went viral....which sent me into a hypo and I painted the whole flat.

"My GP seems really hesitant to refer to me a psyche, I don't know why :/ I've asked about it before...",1
"I'm diagnosed bipolar 2 and yeah that seems pretty consistent with my days. Keep a journal, try to keep details such as how long youre feeling a certain way, how those feelings are, and things you do (much like this post). The days/weeks i consider my ""up"" days (symptoms of mania showing) I try to channel that energy into positive things (going on a run, getting school work done, yard work, chores, piano, etc) and days that I'm down I just acknowledge that I'm ok, it's just the disorder messing with me, and mentally get myself encouraged enough to go for my run. Even if it turns into more of a walk or a short jog normally at least getting moving and outside kickstart my days really well and gets me over that depression hump. But most importantly keep in contact with your doctor. The reason bipolar is so dangerous is the ""mixed"" episodes that can begin to occur. Where you have thoughts/feelings of depression and anxiety but the energy/drive of a manic episode which turns into a combination that leads to self harm. For that reason it's super important to try and stay a step ahead of the disorder and work with your doc to stay as clear headed as possible. During my stay in a psych hospital and therapy, learning as much as I could about cognitive behavioral therapy has helped me every single day and helps me be much more independent",1
"Thank you.  I didn't want anyone to diagnose me, I was just freaking out a bit last night because I went from super high to super low, and I'm terrified of the doctor so I didn't want to go there and make a fool of myself if it was nothing    My GP is trying to sway me away from seeing a psyche, I don't know why.  Maybe I'm that crazy and she knows I'll be sectioned or something if I see one    lol",1

Regardless of whether a side effect is normal or not unless your doctor told you it would happen and don't worry about it you should call him/her and let them know.

"That's normal with many psych meds. Usually it'll subside within a month. Worse case scenario, it may take 2 months. 
If they do not subside within 2 months. Please tell your doctor what is happening. I've had medications where I started having involuntary facial movements. If this occurs on any medication. You want to tell your dr right away. This COULD become permanent if the drug is not discontinued. Its not as scary as it sounds, but that's one side effect you need to be sure to tell your dr about. Good luck to you:-)",1
"Hi, I suffer from BP disorder and I took Latuda and at a certain dosage, both my right hand and right leg shook horibly. I believe its a side affect.  I changed meds. Read the info. That comes with your meds.  Tell your Dr.! Bless You!",1
Bipolar can be extremely happy without worrying about being manic. I can. If you're lopsided on your meds and inclined to the depressive you need an adjustment from say anti depressants to mood stabilizers. But I can assure you it is very easy to be happy and positive with bipolar.,1

So I learned to only take them when I am having a panic attack. Or going into a situation I know will cause an anxiety attack. When taking benzos this way. The medication doesn't make you feel drowsy & forget things. If you only take it as needed. It simply calms you down & stops anxiety attacks. Be careful with benzos. They are addictive & you will build up a tolerance if you take it when you don't need it. With that said. Some people need them. I recommend not taking them as instructed. That is usually why people get into trouble with them. They build up a tolerance. Then you have nothing to combat your worst anxiety.
To lessen my dependants on Xanax. When I feel anxious. I take a product sold by thorne research. Its called ""pharma GABA."" 
For panic attacks. Take your benzo med.
I also take the pharma GABA 250 for sleep. They use to have to give me heavy sedatives for me to sleep. This product works better & you don't feel weird/hungover the next morning. GABA  also isn't habit forming/addictive.
I also recommend cannabis oil. Most people aren't aware that it is legal for anyone to buy cannabis oil, as long as it doesn't contain THC. CBD oil can be purchased online and delivered to your door. Check out ""Charlotte's Web."" There are many other places to purchase it as well.",1

Yes its herbal. I had taken it in texas from H.E.B. its a tonic. Im sure they will have it listed. It did work for a while. They also have other tonics like happy mood etc. Its like taking st johns wort for depression. You can look up and try different types of herbs for anxiety. CBD oil is real good mood lifter.,1
Mine actually told me to for once finish what I started about four months after I tried to commit suicide. They are horrible people. Leave him before it gets worse because it always will.,1
"That is an unbelievably horrible thing to say to someone who is not well and cruel. I might call it abusive. You need somebody who's going to treasure you and help you, not try to push you over the edge. What is it? Control? It's very very toxic and you need to keep yourself safe",1
"Horrible man, you deserve way better than that. Do NOT listen to that MAN!",1
"I told an abusive partner who ""used"" suicide as a threat to manipulate me, I once told him if he did it wouldn't be my fault. Taken out of context those are unbelievably horrible words to say to someone who's just said they're suicidal. So I understand this person just wanting more context. May not change the outcome. Obviously that was a bad relationship for the both of us.",1
"I may be able to help you two out as I see Kayla's point and actually agree. But I see Kimberly disliked your comment. While yes, it is a medical term and here it is being used in a proper connotation ( be it controversial) Kim, I believe you're upset because they didn't say Intellectual Disability correct?? I may be off base, so sorry to assume, I'm just trying to be a friendly gap bridger. Both are correct, but I know "" intellectual disability"" is more PC and the more current term. However, before ID, the term Mental Retardation was used as a correct description of intellectual and mental deficits. 

So yes, in a medical support poster, although the term is a little outdated, it's still not made to belittle or mock ID. Just a older term for the same thing. Medicine is always evolving and so are we. This was made to support and bring attention to many causes, not bring down one.

I also would like to note that I believe whoever made this poster may not be in a medical field or have a strong medical background because Narcolepsy is listed. I have Narcolepsy, but that's not a mental disorder, it's neurological. So perhaps the person responsible meant well, just wasn't fully informed. I believe they really did mean to be supportive, but just didn't know better to use the term ID.",1
"When I first started it I had a similar reaction. As well as getting an upset stomach. I started taking it before I went to bed instead of in the morning which helped heaps, and it settled down after a couple of weeks. Been the best medication for me out of all the ones I've tried.",1
"There is no doubt from your words you are pretty desperate and struggling to cope.  I guess many questions come to mind such as do you have parents? Are they aware of your mental health problems? If they do are they supportive? Also do you have a good doctor? I guess you may be in the US while I'm in the UK where doctors are readily and freely available and you can change around until you find the best for you.

When I was really in a bad way (unfortunately I'm way older, but there are still similarities) plus my teenage son has had acute anxiety and depression, my brother too, when I was ill I was adamant I wouldn't take sleeping tablets, see a counsellor or go onto anti depressant medication, I wouldn't even admit to start with that I had depression until I ended up on the edge of a breakdown and knew for my sake as well as my families something had to change.

I have had a lot of problems with staff at my son's high school pushing him and had an email recently adding more pressure saying he was going to 'fail' his exams and wouldn't be able to continue next year.

This approach is not helping, applies more pressure on him when he is already not coping and makes him feel a failure.  Some of the things he's told me how he feels over the years are heartbreaking, things you never want to hear as a mother, but I'm so relieved tho he can tell me and I want to know how he feels so I can help accordingly.  

I have explained to him it's not about failing or succeeding, if his exam results aren't great then I d like him to be able to think he hasn't achieved quite as well as he'd hoped, but that's not a problem, it's not insurmountable and really it doesn't matter.  There is so much pressure here and probably similar there on our young people to succeed in their studies, it's far too much pressure on their young shoulders, as a society we need to back off, gently encourage and be kind, I'm sure this would be far more affective than frightening and bullying them.

Mental illness isn't being 'stupid', weak, or a failure.  Our brains are the most complex organ, like other parts of our bodies sometimes they don't work so well.  We all need a helping hand from time to time and until the world takes mental illness seriously and stop being unkind, impatient and not understanding then thousands and thousands of people suffer in relative silence.

It's all wrong.  Reach out Hun, tell those who love you how you really feel.  If they truly love you they will understand, it's not for you to make them, they have the responsibility to understand and to help.

Look again at small, but significant steps to make you better.  Do you need something to help your bad periods? Are they causing deficiencies in your body? Medication can be a temporary crutch to help you get back on track during a particularly busy time.  

Can you talk to your lecturer? Jot down some notes so you don't forget, I'm sure your mind might be completely jumbled.  How can you study effectively when you feel like this.  I'm not telling you what to do, just looking at options.  Support is one of the most important things along with consideration and kindness.  

You need people to give you a break, but if they aren't aware of the full facts then they might not be able to help properly, don't push loved ones away, with depression we can feel so alone, but we also try to isolate ourselves too.

Thinking of you and hold on to hope that it will get better, there is always hope, look after yourself x",1
Tell them. Don't be ashamed!,1
"mine is also the worst then. Its been my experience that professors in the field of education are very accomodating to disabilities. whether physical, academic, or mental health related.  you are not weak or fragile; you are suffering from a disease that inhibits your day to day life. Talk to them.",1
I find my anxiety and depression get worse when it's that time of the month. I dropped out of college because it was so bad now that I'm on medication again it's getting a lot better. I also was diagnosed with IBS. Definitely talk to your educator or email then about what's going on I'm sure they will understand and figure something out.,1
Tell them. Trust me it was the hardest but best thing I ever did was to ask for help and accept that I am the way I am. I still struggle but I have some support now. I still have days I wish people didn't know as I am paranoid that people will talk about me and think I'm weak but they can't help if they don't know. We are fighters not failures and you can do this. Doesn't matter if it happens now or after a break if you need time to rebalance. It should be treated no different to if you broke your arm or had a physical illness. Xx,1
"The time of the month is my trigger for depressive episodes. Something about the hormones. I would tell your school. They can usually make exceptions for medical conditions. My friend received extra time to complete tests. I went through failing out of school before I decided to go back on medication. Now that I'm on meds, I'm going back to school this fall. Don't be afraid to ask for help and be open to medicine. Hang in there!",1

Hahaha...and they say I'm paranoid! HA!,1
I agree with you 100% but when I have to piss test for a job even though I have a prescription it's still not allowed. But I need something for my extreme public anxiety and depression.,1
Just the thought of that makes me anxious.. ;),1
Talk with your doctor about seroquel. I don't know how old u r but it is black boxed in the US for older people. The elderly have a heightened risk of death from this med. Other annoying side effects include high blood sugar. And orthostatic hypotension which is a fancy way of saying when u chafe position too fast (sit or stand up) your blood pressure can really drop and u can fall down or black out. This is a drug with a lot of side effects. You should talk to your doctor and evaluate the pros and cons to.decide if this is the best drug for u.,1
Yes. I've struggled with this my whole life,1

"If we're all smart enough to know with certainty that God doesn't exist, anxiety should be small fry. I've been fighting with this shit since I was 17, I'm now 38, so I think I can consider myself something of a veteran. Even so, I'm not willing to rule out ANYTHING that might help EVEN ONE sufferer find a way out of this horrible shit. It's this hypersensitive response to suggestions that stops people finding a way out!!!",1
Sometimes the brain is just uncontrollable :(,1
I believe in God..  I pray for help and to be healed.  God made me this way .. it's a daily struggle.   Believing in a higher power won't cure this disease,1
Please remove this ridiculous and damaging post. Immediately. Shame on you!,1
"No, curing anxiety is not as easy as just turning to God. By that logic, just turning to god should cure a person of cancer, or save them from dying of a fatal disease just like that. 
And I'm pretty sure a lot of people with bipolar, depression and anxiety who follow God are actually decent Christians, yet they still have those conditions.

"Wow, you sound a lot like the church counselor who told me that the reason I have depression and anxiety and am suicidal is because I was doing things God didn't want me to do. Fuck off, for real.",1
"So many people, so many offended by this. Just a quote for one, and for another it's just giving you an out, so you don't have to worry. It's a ""God"" of your understanding. It clearly did not say, be Christian or be anxious. Wow!",1
"I have lived with anxiety for about   20 years also social anxiety which i have under control thanks to support groups and plenty of coping skills.  My meds are a very low dose so i rely on what i have been taught in therapy and especially group therapy. I strongly suggest going to Mental Health or Behavioral Health and taking these groups. I believe from my own experiences meds alone didn't fix my diagnosis. In fact i was over medicated and my life was falling apart. I lost count but i have been hopsitalized 12 times and i understand having resentment to god as to why he would do this to me, thorazine shots, Haldol shots, five point restraint, isolation rooms, taking my friends and family away who i loved with all my heart. It was the excessive force or several beatings i have taken from up to five male staff members and hearing two female staff members screaming for them to stop, saying your hurting him. But they didn't stop. I guess they were tryng to teach me a lesson not to stand up for others or myself. So i stopped praying for many years mad at god. Luckily my FAITH in god kept me from ending my life. Someone questioned gods plan and i understand. I know work for the Mental Health system and i am a board member for Behavioral Health and work for Kings View as a Certified Peer Support Specialist. You see god wasn't done with my journey and now i see his plan clearly. Everything i have been through i believe happened for a reason so i can help others just like",1

"I'm only 21 years old. I've already been on lots on medication that hasn't helped and had counselling which helped for about 5 minutes but now it's worse.. I never want to go out because of my depression and anxiety.. I have to be made to go out otherwise I just wouldn't. I work 6 days a week which is hard for me some days.. every day I have at least one person saying to me 'why do you look so miserable all of time' or 'pick your face up off the ground' or 'snap out of it' which makes me feel worse cause it doesn't matter how many times you tell them people you can't help it they still make you feel crap and just don't understand.. people who don't suffer with depression honestly do not get it and it is very frustrating. I'm not living anymore I'm just exsisting.

Additional comment from the original poster",1
"It's so hard when you feel as bad as you do.  Severe depression is all encompassing.  It defines you and takes over your whole life.  Everyday is pretty much the same in terms of desperation, sorrow and trying to battle the demons in your head when  you are least able.
I remember all too clearly day after day, week after week being sofa bound willing the endless days to end having no strength or drive to be able to change things or get better.  The trouble is recovering from severe depression involves so many things and all of which involve strategies which seem almost alien and impossible to implement.

It can seem such a monumental task and when the task seems so huge I think it is almost impossible to believe you can ever make it happen.

Don't give up on that hope.  When there is hope there is a chance.  I know it can seem so far away or so difficult to find that contentment or inner peace we all crave, but you can do it.  You ve come this far, you must congratulate yourself for doing so well to get this far when your mind is leading you astray.

Whilst I was wasting my life and just existing, not living I wanted escape, constantly not wanting this life, but because I Lived through the carnage of my closest friend and relative's suicide, I knew that just wasn't the answer.  I wanted escape, but not that.  I knew there had to be another way.

There are so many questions I'd need to ask about your support, if you have any medication, if you have access to professional services, I'm in the UK and I suspect you are in the US and services might not be available or affordable.  I am no expert, just someone who cares and understands able mental illness and the hideous affect it can have and the intolerance and ignorance which exists in the world.  
I finally reached the realisation that no one else would get me off that sofa, only me, I had to find the determination and strength to do it, I owed it to myself.  
I came up with a plan, I wasn't going to waste any more life.  A goal for the future, some big things e.g. Find some meaningful voluntary work, some small e.g. Sit in the sunshine.  Many things were involved from sleeping tablets to give me a welcome respite to getting counselling, so many things contributed and were necessary, from trying to eat better to reaching out to loved ones, admitting I needed them.

I'm not pretending it was quick and I'm still on the path, but I'm now working and have a completely different life, I call it my new life after depression.  Big steps are not necessary because they are unachievable, small, achievable but significant steps are the ones that can work, tiny goals, but steps forward, not back, don't try to run before you can walk.  My aim is to write a book one day, but for now I am happy to enjoy the little pleasures in life, confirmation I have made it through and there is no going back.  Best wishes, thoughts and hope to you, there is a better way xx",1
To this I would say you don't want it to all be over if you did this wouldn't have got wrote ...it's hard being in a dark place even more so when u can see yourself pushing loved ones away ...because your already scared they will leave you and pushing them away just heighten that feeling and then that makes u worse ....first you need to find a smile not a fake one ..for any means necessary..a TV show a child's innocent smile .once u have that slight brake thru now you need to grab hold of that and look deep find out what's making you angry ...more than not be aimed at yourself ..and work with it it's only way I get thru them and when I get angry I like it I feed on it but I get a moment of clarity and that's what I grab hold of ...don't think about giving up that won't make u better that makes all your loved ones worse and possibly on the road that your on now,1

I had that with Jess now my stress is threw the roof.,1
First off your illness had nothing to do with what you did.  10 year olds know right from wrong .no amount of rumors made you do it either .blaming your illnesses is wrong because you do have conscious. Smh. Secondly what's done is done .the past is the past for a reason .as far as wanting forgiveness ruining a teacher's welfare and reputation probably isn't going to be fixed with I'm sorry. So you were Ill...no pass sorry .you knew what you were doing. You even said you felt guilt . You just need to live with it and move on .,1
"I'll tell you what I'd do .. write him a letter explaining the truth , it's eating you alive and you need to apologize to move past it . Give it to the headmaster and make peace with the fact it's part of the past and think of it like this  .. It can rest on him .. if he wants to hate you , give him that option but it puts ""it"" on him and releases the guilt for you . Once you know you did the right thing by letting him know how you feel about it as in ..it bothers you to the point of interfering with your life! You should feel better because you've done everything in your power to show him you acknowledge the damage you caused. . He might hate you but it's gotta feel rewarding to know it hurts you :/ , if that's true. If not he'll forgive you .. Either way forgive yourself,  you know your sorry!",1
Reach out to bipolar support groups and mental health education outreach programs and try to find a way to have professionals go to schools and educate adolescents who are vulnerable and susceptible to mental illness. You can help prevent this from happening again. Sometimes it's best to leave the past alone so you don't drag up old feelings and just try to pay it forward.,1
"focus on righting your wrong through future actions. make sure you talk to preteens about bullying etc. Don't feel so eternity guilty. its done and over with. as an adult go speak to the headmaster, have a meeting with the teacher and the headmaster. if explaining your actions will calm your guilt. if they will not hear you write a letter.",1
"Shaming someone is never useful. She's trying to dig herself out of shame. Unless you are without flaws, I would suggest some kindness.",1
"Ummm I'm sorry bad mouthing her did not ruin her life, it may have made it suck quite a bit. 

He on the other hand could have gotten jail time,lost his job, lost friends and family, the list goes on and on. His life WOULD have been ruined.

I agree the whole situation in general sucks and she was by all accounts still a child, and mentally ill at that but don't compare the two. I've been bullied and had rumors about me in school.  It's nothing compared to what he would have dealt with. Also 2 wrongs don't make a right. Oh he said something bad so I can retaliate. NO. 

It sounds like she's better and everyone has moved on except her sense of guilt.  I say to just let it go.  If there is no permanent damage, you should seek counseling to help you move past.  I'm sorry all this happened but as long as you hold yourself accountable and move past it you'll hopefully be okay",1
"What about the teacher bad mouthing first?? He destroyed this girls life and she retaliated by doing the same. Both to blame I'm afraid. I do not condone anything I have read in this topic but I'm just saying. The damage has been done,  people know the truth,  sometimes it's just best to let sleeping dogs lie and try to move on from this. It could have been worse and it wasn't so you are really lucky there. Best of luck to you and I hope you manage to forgive yourself because unfortunately you will most likely never forget.",1
Exactly why my mom gets the worst of my venting ... I'm not mean but I'm tough on her .. she also has bipolar personality disorder anxiety and life long addiction issues. . Would do anything in the world for her though .. you are clearly her rock!,1
"When you can't say anything correct to someone with bipolar disorder. Try just listening. Even if it means listening to us cry. 
She isn't in control of her actions. My mother has often been my life line. Even though I have said horrible things to her. She knows me & still loves me. Possibly you are the only person she thinks loves her unconditionally.",1
"I spent years lashing out at the people I love, desperately looking for someone or something to blame for my bipolar disorder and desperately projecting my fear, anger and confusion onto others in vain efforts to dissipate or lessen the pain I felt. In time I learned that people's patience, however much they love you, has to be finite for their sake and their emotional wellbeing. Mental illness always has collateral damage and it's those closest to us who suffer when we do. Now I have a baby daughter I have made a choice that I will always work to protect her from any potential ills my condition brings. That primarily involves being active in my wellbeing, taking responsibility for my behaviour and owning my mind again. It's far from easy, it often takes greater effort than I am able to give, but for her sake and for those I love I keep going. Good luck to you both x",1

Then they embalm you and make your boobs stick out like Dolly Parton. And looking like a vampire, even though I love vampires, just isn't my style. It's never the expensive makeup. It's always the hot pink or bright pink lipstick. And boy, they pack on the blush. It's always the hot pink blush. I don't know about you, but they have awful tastes in makeup for the dead. Why should we care about makeup? I don't want to look like a hooker (apologies to hookers) in a coffin. Look, we're all in debt, but that isn't a good enough reason to kill yourself. Hey, wave your pills if you're in student loan debt (waves pills)! And no parent thinks of their child as a burden. I love to argue with my kids (even if they think they know-it-all). I still love my babies. Even when they're 100. You have to form a bucket list of what you want to do in life. It's time to start living.

So, you're in debt. We all have debts. Lawd... I think my face will freeze and I'll look like Janice Dickinson. Make a list on things you want to live for, and do it. Even if you're in debt. It isn't the end of the world. You may think it is, but debt isn't something to worry about. I wish I could ((hug)) you in person. So, you have to settle for this pathetic web ((hug)).

But that's just my personality I come through so much that I'm not going to apologize for my past that has shaped me into the person that I am so whatever you need to do to help yourself that's the path you should take but taking your life will never be the answer take it from somebody that tempted it three timesThe more people I talk to more people are open with me and I find out a lot of people are struggling with depression and mental illness trust me you're not alone we like to hide behind shadows thinking that we have perfected a reflection of happiness with in ourselves but if you open up and you let people and you will see that everybody struggling in a different way and that you are not alone but I wish that you will read this before you decide to do anything and you will consider to give life a second chance and give your parents a chance to help youmuch love I will be praying for you that you will be able to get through this hard time (from )Marisol  your new friend,1
"Your meds or find alternative medicines that might help you exercise diet meditation it's hard at the beginning but these things have worked for me if you ever want to private message me I'm here I've gone through a lot of therapy's I've done EMD are I done speech therapy I've done medication I've done therapy three times a week for three hours a day I've done meditation I've exercised for 19 years. I don't juice fasting, diet changes, herbs minerals Epson salt bath mineral Springs yoga hot yoga I have thought the illness with all my might and my results have been what I've expected. It hasn't been easy at times and there has been times that I wanted to give up but looking back now I'm glad that I tried everything and that I'm here you will be glad to it just takes time and things will get better I promise sorry about my spelling I have dyslexia so at times I don't spell correctly. I tell people what my illnesses I'm not afraid I was embarrassed for a very long time I tell everybody that meets me if they want to know and if I'm depressed I'll let people know that I'm not feeling well so I could get what I need I learned to tell people what I need because people are not mind readers and only you know exactly what you need at the time",1
Please don't do anything at this moment. I had 3 suicide attempts. And I survived all of them one of them I was revived one of them a tree caught me and the other one the gun didn't go off. Everything gets better I've seen my daughter grow up to be a excellent young lady and if my life would've ended earlier I wouldn't of got to experience motherhood relationships marriage. I also have would not of been enjoy the wonderful moments in my life that I would've missed if I was not here. My parents would've never recovered from that and they would've had a void in their heart for the rest of their life because nobody can live without their parents or their children so live at least one breath at a time one day at a time there's always help there's medications there's therapies. There's natural remedies I could give you a whole list of things medication adjustments I'm not a doctor but a lot of things have worked to me I would I had inside he disorder every 30 minutes a day I finally found the right doctor they gave me the right prescription and I haven't had one in seven years. If you would've told me back then that I would not have any in In Anxiety I would've not believed you and said leave me alone. I have left a handwritten letter before the paramedics revived me the look on my mom's face and being a life at that moment made me realize how much damaged I would've caused damn good. Your parents like you regardless of your debt and all the stuff the thought you put them through they will forget everything you put them through I am a parent now and there is nothing that would stop me from loving my child even if my child was a A criminal nothing you can do in this lifetime could make your parents not love you. So please once again asked them for help. I thought the same thing when I was in a parent that I have put my mother through enough but she never stopped helping me and she never stop believing that I could get better even when I could not believe it myselfthere is no burden for a parent you are not a burden. I'll be your parents they'll be more gladly that you reached out to them then you take your life there is nothing that your parents would do for you for you that would cause him any discomfort as a parent we might not react in the best way in certain situations. But we are always there willing to help whatever you need we always need our children you need to see other doctors and change,1
"You're describing me.   I'm on the ledge of anxious despair and suicide, several times a day.   My anxiety twists through my chest,  like a knife killing me, but it can't.    I've lived like this since I can remember, my early teens, but now I’m sixty.    I can function, they're the ghost I hide.      I wish my normalcy was as intense.     My wife and son are the candle keeping  meaning in my life.     No matter how dark I feel, I glance over to them.    I see through my  despair.   They're guiding my existence...  I wish peace for you.     I’ll never have it.    Yet, my feelings are my super power.    And I’ll never give them up.    I use no meds, but meditation, and long walks.    i wish i could feel your world through your heart.",1
"My sons clinic is no longer giving out benzos and brought in an addiction specialist.  My son occasionally takes valium but another son of mine got addicted taking 3 a day for many, many years and it made his anxiety worse.  He got off of it through his therapist.  I think it is okay to use them but not for years at a time and not so many a day.",1
"I am taking buspar currently on 22.5 mg twice a day and I think it is helping- it is non addictive and I too wanted to limit my use of benzos as they are my drug of choice when I get crazy.  You can go up to 30 mg twice a day- I started slowly and worked up and I feel a lot less anxious, worried and irritable.  I had to ask my doctor if I could try it- either he doesn't prescribe it often or just did not understand the anxiety component to my bipolar 1 disease.",1
Please talk to your doctor. I am on alprazolam three times a day. Hydroxine at night. I feel you about the benzos but my docs are telling me and assuring me that there is nothing wrong with taking them. Take things a day at a time and just tell your doctor what is going on. Try and put your trust in the doctor. I know this is difficult when you have anxiety. You probably feel scared to trust. I know I have been there. Please reach out and give it a try.,1

"OH i hate posts like this! Damn pharmaceutical meds are killing people! Please, i beg of you do not harm your self and do not give up. But do ween your self off the Pharmaceuticals and start a regimen of sativa use. Find a nice cannabis sativa and try it. It really does work. It has changed my life! I was ready to pull the trigger so m,any time but i just could not leave my kids so I tried cannabis and found a real nice sativa strain that was a miracle cure. I am now happy and productive. My kids still fear the monster that was living in my brain but I have really turned my life around. Please I beg of you,Do Not Give Up!",1

Please don't give up. Depression makes you think irrationally. Talk to someone. It's a start. You're worth it. Love yourself enough to keep fighting. Writing this was an awesome step. You are braver than you think.,1
I can so relate to this... it's a terrible feeling and scary when we don't know how to make it better.   The hopelessness that is just overwhelming.  Don't stop fighting it.  Even if you don't feel like you are making any  improvements... keep in mind that every day you choose live is an accomplishment in itself.,1
"Please sweetheart don't give up. I feel your pain. I was at the end of dealing with things after a lifetime of torture. My sister took her life in a very violent way. Her babies and I walked in after she did it. After twenty years, I still have awful panic attacks, horrible flashbacks, and an awful amount of guilt. Her boys have suffered horribly too. Even after witnessing all of that trauma, I still was in so much agony that I just wanted the pain to end. But you know, I have fought and worked to get the right docs to help me. Please reach out for help. I promise you that things can get better when you least expect it. I had absolutely zero hope. I was wishing to die. It really does get better.

"Sometimes the hardest thing is communicating. Sometimes people are ready and willing to put themselves in your shoes, but they can't do that unless you take them off and hand them over. By that I mean sharing what you are thinking and feeling, even if you are embarrassed or ashamed of it. If all you do is grunt, ""I'm not feeling well,"" your friends and loved ones can't imagine what's going on in your head. You have to share, and that's difficult because anxiety wants to hide. You don't want to be judged, you don't want to ""bother"" anyone. Screw it: if someone close to you has made the effort to ask what's wrong, make the effort to tell them honestly. Don't let your illness make you push people away.",1
Yes.....I'm going through a horrible down time that has been lasting almost a year now.

Yes it is very hard. I have a partner now and it has been pretty tough for us to get to a point where he can get me to trust him and for him to understand all the quirks about BPD.

"I was diagnoised with Bi Ploal, Manic Depression with panic disorder.  My life was a roller coster and my poor family road it everyday with me even if they didn't want to.  I was put on medication that took serveral years to find a good combo that would at least get me some level of normalcy.  Not everday is good, I still have trouble going to places alone, like the grocery store, etc.  As a single woman now it has left me to become somwhat of a hermit.  I don't like leaving my home, except to go to work (which of course I MUST do).  But I don't date, my friends have all gone away (mainly because I push them away).  I still ride the roller coster, but not as often.  My daughter can tell a difference and for me that is why I continue to take my medication and chose to live.  It is difficult I will say and some days I wonder how I've made it this far.  But you have to want to live.  I do it on my terms which is not always the right way in most peoples eyes, but I am as happy as any Bi Polar, Manic Depressed person can be.

"I'm diagnosised Bipolar 1, Anxiety, Depression, and PTSD. In the area where I live NAMI has support groups every night of the week.

Just happened last night for first time I've never been so scared in my life,1
I take gabapentin for anxiety. It works well.,1
"I used to have episodes like yours. My docs will not prescribe benzodiazapines for anxiety because they are addictive and you have to reduce your dosage gradually or you will experience withdrawal symptoms. Not good. A couple of years ago, my psych prescribed Buspar (busparone) and it completely changed my life. So effective for my severe anxiety and obsessive compulsive behaviors. Absolutely the best psych med I've ever used. Lots of the people in my support use it and they feel the same way. I have no side effects, just a little drowsiness when I first  started  using it. I do feel a big difference if I forget a couple of doses. Symptoms will come back. I highly, highly recommend it.",1
"Back when I was in high-school I was put on Buspar for my anxiety and depression.  Mom would bring me my meds with instant oatmeal and hot cocoa usually for breakfast to take them with before I even got out of bed.  It gave me such bad tummy aches that I'd often be doubled over in pain for a few hours after taking them.  I ended up having to repeat my junior year of high school because I missed on average 1 day a week of school.  Can't pass classes when you miss 36 days first period tapering of to 27 days 6th period all in one semester.  (If I started feeling better I'd go to school late, not skip the whole day)  What ended up working for me was Effexor (combined with the Adderall I was taking for ADD.)",1
Maybe I should see if I can go back on it. Used it before for bladder shyness.,1
"Yes, it is so scary. I also have extreme anxiety among other things. I am on a couple anti-anxiety meds and they help some but not all together. For me, when I am at that point, I don't know if anything med wise would work. Of course, I am no doctor. Just try and take it a day at a time. Sometimes that is all we can do.

"Every so often I get really bad chest pain at the sternum and I become unable to take deep breaths until it goes away.  I've gone to the doctors a few times over the years for it and each time, because I also have shoulder pain, they completely ignore the respiratory issue, hook me up to an EKG, tell me my heart is in perfect condition, and send me on my way.  One time they said it might be caused by heart burn and to take over the counter meds for it.  It helped the heart burn but not the chest pain.  Never thought it might be connected to my anxiety or depression before.  Hmm...",1

Valium is dangerous if not monitored. I would go to a new doctor and get new medication. You can't live like that. And don't be scared to tell him everything. I did that before. I was so afraid that the doctors would take my kids away. But I got over that DELUSIONAL thought. It bothered me terribly. But today I discuss every! Every! Think,1

"I struggle quite a bit with this. I am BP 1 and have learned management tools over the past 27+ yrs, but sometimes my demons get so horrible and if triggered the right way I lose the battle I try so hard to fight every day.

What I was trying to stress was that there wasn't a ""mood stabilizer"" in this combination of medicines this person is taking. Now let me clarify. When I say ""mood stabilizers."" Most of these medications are actually anti-convulsant drugs. I'm referring to them as ""mood stabilizers"" for simplicity purposes:-)",1

Everyone is different which is why there's so many different meds out there. I haven't had any bad side effects with this one unless I miss a day. I do horribly mentally for a couple days up to a week if I miss a day. I also take a few other meds with it because my brain worms are bastards.",1
So sorry to hear of your loss joy sincerly my condonlences to you and his wife ...yes im mighty angry at the fact the pathetic mental health system is just crap they should be ashamed of themselfs to the max they all need to pull there fingers out and start helping instead of hindering the system is a shambles ..I myself have bi polar and is a struggle and a rollercoaster ride but yes more needs to be done straight away for many suffers ..and again joy im sorry for your loss ..*,1
I'm so sorry for your loss but happy you're speaking out to help more of us. I'm asking for help... My insurance dropped me and now I am having trouble getting my anti depressants... I've been off them a week and I have gone back to where I used to be.... Struggling....I want to sell my possessions and end the pain. I've not hurt myself but I've thought of at least cutting.... So I draw on myself.,1
I've been on it for probably 12years or so. Its the one medication that my doctor has never taken me off of or changed (not quite sure why)  I'm on a pretty high dose of it.  I don't quite remember what side effects I had at the beginning but I do have certain side effects now. I normally take it at night before going to bed. If I happen to drink or eat anything after taking more often than not I get a feeling come over me like I'm drunk. My doctor could never explain if thats a true side effect but its been happening to me the whole time I take it. As well as if I miss a dose that following day my body is extremely shaky (even feels like my body is shaking from the inside)  and I can't seem to focus correctly until I take it again.,1
The meds scare me worse then the mood swing and my own thoughts.,1
"I was diagnosed with bipolar 15 years ago, at that time I had become very poorly and tried to kill myself, luckily my doctor, has been fantastic  and spent alot of time getting my meds right.  I refused to be admitted to mental health hospital, went every week to a special clinic, with other outpatients.  My doctor didn't think I would ever hold down a full time job, but I can say with much pride that I managed to hold down my job for the last 13 years, look after my family and now my grandchildren, one of which I have special guardian ship of. Every day is a struggle, but I have been blessed with a wonderful family and some really lovely friends. When I feel an episode coming on I go straight to my doctor  if it is bad, but I have come to recognise triggers and my husband, children and parents also can tell when something is wrong.  I won't let the BIG BLACK NOTHING get me so poorly again.  Please if you think there is something wrong, don't be scared or embarrassed, it isn't a bad thing to need help. BE HAPPY it is your right!!!!         ",1
"Thank you for posting this! How does a brain know when it's sick?  If people just mock them or avoid them it stays the same. Be patient but persistent on how to deal with triggers. It is very difficult dealing with other's problems but  if you love them it's worth it.. When taking meds, make sure the person has shown improvement of some kind. Sometimes there's more than 1 med for a disorder. Make sure you eat foods that are HIGH in Seretonin, Norepinephrine &  etc...because the meds DON'T produce more of it they just keep the ones your body produces from escaping their path & dying. With these disorders your brain doesn't produce enough of them which CAUSES the disorder. Just try it & see if you notice a difference. Just google Seretonin etc..... & find what foods you like. NUTRITION is VERY important for the disorder and not many Dr's and counselors explain this completely where people understand it. Write down EVERYTHING so if you forget then it's still right there or have someone you trust go with you to get the info in case you missed something. Also Exercise as much as you can and whatever you can do cause the euphoria also helps a lot. If anyone out there  didn't know this PLEASE, PLEASE try this & see if it helps or help someone you know with the disorder. Having worked with kids that have brain disorders it is so gratifying when you see them improving. KEEP POSITIVE for the one with the disorder because they can't until they're stable.     ‍  ‍  ‍    ☺️    ",1
I have depression and anxiety and I have most of these symptoms       ,1
I haven't gotten diagnosed with BPD. But I've been diagnosed with major chronic depression and generalized anxiety disorder..But the older I get the more I've started to notice I have symptoms of bpd and some of my friends who do have bpd believe that I do.. I'm terrified to go back to a doctor. Because people already look at me weird for my depression and anxiety.. I don't know what to do..and I feel as if it's getting worse,1
"I'm in Liverpool it's taken me 15 years for me for anyone to take me seriously. I have been constantly Mis diagnosed by my gp since 2005. I have been told over and over again I was suffering with post natal depression as I a mother of 6. I knew dam well it wasn't. Anyway, one day i broke down infront of a new GP and begged for help. I got  a feferal to broad oak mental health hospital. I had an assessment there and they knew straight away i had borderline and possible bipolar. I thought oh great I will at least be treated now... how wrong was I!! I was then told I will have to see a clinic psychologist who could prescribe me mood stabilizers and anti psychotics  which i desperately need and that was over 6 weeks ago and I still have had no appointment through to see anyone. I was also promised an intensive course of CBT and /or DBT and again , I've heard nothing.  I have rang every week telling them I'm desperate and I need my meds now and they just say wait for your appointments to come through.  It's a complete joke!!!! God forbid what could happen in the mean time. It's virtually impossible to get help in the UK",1
Hell no! Im in Australia the uks treatment of the clinically insane scares me.,1
I have depression and anxiety very bad have been on 7 meds none worked from my primary dr. Shoul i see a psychiatrist to get better idea of what i need,1
BPD is short for Borderline Personality Disorder and should not be confused with Bipolar Disorder.,1
Effexor extended release at 150m is what I am on and I have been on this for almost 10 years now. I ain't going to lie it is horrible if you go cold turkey off of it. If you wheen yourself off not so bad. Now every day feeling it's made me maintain at an even keel. But from what I am reading from everyone responding is that it's totally individual and I would try it and if you feel like it's not making things even for you then wheen yourself off slowly,1
Im on 150mg and its the only drug ive been on thst works for me. Withdrawals are horrible if you miss dosages though.,1
Horrible night sweats!!! The withdrawal is absolutely horrible. Never again!!!!,1
"I'm on it for anxiety, and depression. She is hoping it helps stabilize my moods Bc I'm bipolar as well. I took it for the first time last night. Idk if it was just my anxiety about taking it, but my chest hurt. And I didn't sleep good at all! All these side effects scare me Bc I have two young children, an 18 month old and a 2 month old. I don't wanna be irritable, or saddened even more, I have to take care of my babies. What if I don't notice myself change? I'm doing it alone so I don't have anyone to tell me if I'm being extra cranky or if I'm snapping. I don't wanna snap on my kids    or go through withdrawals.",1
I was on it and it was horrible. I was like a zombie and the depression was horrendous. I slept for 6 months. Coming off it  was frightening. I was so sick with shakes and aches and nausea plus hallucinations...very scary.,1
"Effexor worked for a while then it lost its edge so ended up on Valium with it as well for short time. But now I just end up taking a 150 in the morning and a 150 in the afternoon it helps me get through the day . But only just. I've anger general anxiety disorder and depression. Been on various meds now for nearly 10 years , since I got diagnosed with cancer . Cancers gone but the mental issues that came with it still remain",1
Messed my blood pressure up bad. Passed out more than once,1
I thought it made me irritable stopped and went back to Prozac but that was a long time ago I was only 14,1
"First off I've PTSD and don't know your infliction. It's a horribly  addictive drug. Ever have brain shocks?  Objectively it did take my sadness and anger away but it left me with nothing. I missed my feelings no matter how awful. I felt like a zombie and I locked myself in a room for 4 years. I would not prescribe it but I'm sure it has benefits. It's dangerous and addictive, know that before hand.  It could lead to suicidal thoughts of hopelessness. Be wary of any pharmaceutical,there  is no magic fix, doesn't exist.",1
"Horrible,awful withdrawal if you have to go off of it",1
Took it for anxiety before I knew I was bipolar....went hypomanic for the first time at age 40... now I need mood stabilzier and antidepressant ( bipolar type 2).,1
high anxiety and panic attacks suicidal also,1
Whats your dose?  Im struggling on 150mg think i need more. Gp is reluctant to put me up or try something new,1
"Effexor works better for me than Celexa, Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and Prestique. I had absolutely no weight gain and no other side effects . Works well for me. Only issue I've had has been the fact that if I miss a dose I feel crappy and uneasy until I take. Always keep a day or two of meds with me no matter where I am going just in case I get somewhere and realize I forgot a dose.",1
I'm on 75mg of it currently and I feel like it doesn't really do much of anything but make me more depressed. Not to mention that I've only ever missed one day of it at it was absolutely horrible. I wanted to die.,1
"Get the brain shocks when in detox?  Me too, horrible drug. Does help with depression but leaves you feeling numb. That's a prison I never want to return too.",1
It was awful !! Especially when I came off I went through horrible withdrawal.,1
"Night terrors, high blood pressure, fits of rage......not the right one for me.   I went back to Celexa and all is well.",1
"I like it. I take it in conjunction with other medications. I do however opt for the tablets versus the extended release. I can miss a round of my meds and not be too off my game, but will be slightly grumpy/more anxious. 

Like others have said, you have to find what works for your body. Trial and error is a sometimes long process. But having a supportive, understanding Dr is the best thing for you when trying to find the right meds.",1
I did not have a good expirience on it...it made me horribly suicidal..then when i was getting off of it the withdrawals are like compared to getting off of heroin. One of the worse anti depressants to come off of. I missed 3 months of work feeling like i had the flu every single day. It was awful.,1
Is it anxiety attacks? Bc that's what I was told when I was having them,1
I've been to the ER because I had chest pains.  Mine was also stress related.  Now that I'm on medication I've no longer had those symptoms,1
I do the same thing when my anxiety is high or I don't get enough sleep.,1
"That used to happen to me alot, then it stopped. Don't know why.talk to a dr about it, maybe it has something to do with anxiety",1
"One of my sons does this, especially when he sleeps, for him it is anxiety, he had a sleep trial done to rule out apnea.",1

"Hi Kristy. I just took a look at your profile page. Is that your beautiful baby girl in that picture?  She is precious. I know you may feel like you don't matter to anyone right now but I bet you mean the world to her. I see you're engaged. That's something great to look forward to. I have kids myself and I've felt like ending it all on many occasions. I've actually tried a couple of times. I know you're in a very dark place right now. Please try to remember these feelings will pass. You have people close to you who love you very much and would be devastated if you were taken away from them. Thinking about my kids has kept me from hurting myself many times. I know when you're in that state of mind it's hard to realize anyone really cares but they do. You have to try to remember that. Here I am a complete stranger and I'm very worried about you. You are a beautiful young woman with a lot to offer this world.  I know you are also strong to have survived depression as long as you have and you weren't afraid to reach out to total strangers for help. Is your fiance understanding of your depression? I know it's hard in relationships sometimes but he may be someone you can turn to. If you're just looking for others to talk to who understand how you feel then I'm sure there are many on this forum who would love to talk to you anytime. You're welcome to message me anytime just to talk. Just please think of those who love you and would be very sad if you weren't here anymore. If the feeling is too bad for you, please call the suicide hotline or go to the ER. If you feel like talking, make another post or message me or someone else. Just please don't hurt yourself. I promise you these horrible feelings will pass. I know you know that deep inside. Please hang in there.",1
Call a suicide hotline and talk to all of us. I know life can be rough and overwhelming sometimes dont give up.,1
"The biggest thing that I know to avoid for us is any of the artificial sweeteners. They break down into some nasty chemicals that do not react well with our brains. I have been struggling with my appetite so it has been very hard to me to be interested in eating at all. But I do so much better on a well balanced diet. Especially if I can grab a quick snack of veggies or fruit through out the day. But, like I said, I have no appetite so finding anything to get me to eat is hard. And that makes the symptoms roar.",1
I would suggest having some blood work done and make sure you aren't deficient  in any vitamins or minerals. Many times people with Bipolar or depression are deficient in vitamin D and other things. So you might want to add that to you diet or take a supplement. I think ( and please don't think I have any science to back me up on this) that things vary from person to person. But based on what I see with meds that some meds work for some people and others work for others I am going to guess that is the way it is with diets too. What will work for you might not be what works for others. I mean there are some definite things all bipolars should avoid like alcohol and non-prescribed drugs and maybe don't over indulge in caffeine I try to stay under two cups a day but some days I go over that because I LOVE coffee so much.. Other than that I try to eat food that makes me feel good. Some days it is stuff that actually makes me feel healthy some days it is stuff that makes me feel like I want to live. It depends on what sort of day I am having. Fresh fruits and veges are good for everyone lean meats are good for everyone. lots of water is good for everyone staying away from junk food and sweets is good for everyone. A nice walk is good for everyone.,1
"No secrets here. Eat healthy food. Avoid alcohol, caffeine and tobacco.",1
This is the best advice I have gotten in a long time thank you Nicole!!!  Things r lil better today still feeling a bit overwhelmed but I know I can get thro this.. I need to find meds that actually work maybe a better doctor,1
"With my husband, he said that he doesn't know how to talk to me anymore. We've been together for 9 years, I've been dealing with this for almost 20 years.

Ha ha if I stopped my meds that would be the time for them to start worrying,1
Melissa Thorn... I had terror,1
"I had a supervisor who I had trusted and I confided in. Apparently she notated my file. The next supervisor I had became very agitated and afraid of me after she read my file When I asked what was the matter, she refused to answer me, so I went to her boss and found out the reason. She then refused to meet with me alone in the same room. I was not allowed to read my file either. I went to human resources after that and requested a new supervisor, which was turned down. I was working in a Call Center where there was constant noise, change, interruption, you name it. All things that are really bad for someone with BP. I ended up in the hospital several times and eventually went on short term, then long term disability. After that experience, I am very careful who I confide in. But you betcha, I stick up for us when people have blown out ideas about BP",1
"Well my experience when I try explainin my BP is, well I,m exactly like that......I think what the FUCK!!!!???? Its so Frustratin.....ITS NOT A CLUB.....ITS A HORRIBLE THING TO DEAL WITH...!!!

"I know this feeling all too well but you have to learn to laugh.  One time at work years ago I'll never forget...this chic just out in the open office ""I can't stand bipolar people, they scare me.  They should all be locked up medicated or not.""",1
"Its true most bipolar and anxiety patients suffer with yoyo sex drive. BT this is due to meds, according to research I did sex is almost non exsistent. So it takes u and yr partner to work together to make it work. So dont just say its not der , make plans HV date nights snuggle take showers and baths together. Help him and make sure he gets back on his meds. Gv it tym your will settle into a routine from there the skies the limit. God bless",1
"you say he`s not medicate. is he in counseling/therapy? have you attended such with him? if not, that might be an option. or maybe find a group to try? certain meds did that to me. thank god my dr decided that class of drugs doesn`t help me. also have you tried positive stress relief? basically any safe, legal activity that makes him smile, laugh or feel accomplished. have you ruled out medical problems? I don`t like to admit it but some of us need medicated. the right meds schedule is a better for me than fighting it all the time to just scrape by.",1
The only time I feel like sex is when I'm manic. Otherwise I have no sex drive. The depression and anxiety destroy it. Although you try to make it happen it just doesn't. It doesn't mean he doesn't love you or not find you attractive. Its the illness. It must be difficult for you. It will be for him too but In a different way. Hope his health improves soon. X,1
"Proformance anxiety amay be the problem. THere can be anxiety along with bipolar and when they need to perform, in many different areas, the anxiety goes sky high and they just cant no matter how much they may want too. Nothing to do with love.",1
"My boyfriend is PTSD, bi-polar or possibly BPD. He wants to have sex sometimes as do I, but we don't and have not for almost a year. The reason is he is so Mean and says such awful things or most every comment or reminder I make he takes as a personal assault. This makes me withdrawal and afraid of him. Makes it very difficult to be intimate. I love and care for him so very much, but the hurt and anger he exudes is an instant and on going turn off. It is hard to be open and vulnerable with someone who now blames you for all of his issues. I try so hard.",1
When I am in a depressive cycle (most of the time) I struggle with my sex drive. When not medicated as well - then I have zero sex drive. A red flag that I'm in trouble is when I can't get enough sex. It's guaranteed that I'm heading into a hypomanic cycle then.,1
"Firstly.....No-One will take yr children from you honey, so Cross that Worry off yr list. Sounds like depression or maybe Bipolar. Please SEE YR GP & dont EVER be scared to tell someone how yr feeling!!! Hope this helps & Much LUV 2 YOU! Yr NOT ALONE IN THIS!           ",1
They definitely will not take your kids if u r seeking help! But it does sound like anxiety and some type of mood disorder. Catch it now cause it can get worse! Get with a Dr asap! Your whole life will change once they get you seen about.,1
You are obviously concerned so my suggestion is to see your dr. I would also suggest keeping a mood journal listing dates and times of mood changes and how you feel at that time. You can then take this journal to your dr and it can be a very effective diagnostic tool. You don't always remember everything when you go to see a dr about mental health because of anxiety or poor memory in general.,1
Definitely seek help from somewhere it's sounds like bipolar ii with anxiety,1
"Sounds like u have a mood disorder of some sorts. And anxiety issues. 
Bit that can only be diagnosed by a professional. So my advice would be to see a psychiatrist.
No they r not gonna take ur kids away because u suffer from depression and anxiety! That just doesnt happen so dont worry about that.
Seek help from ur local county social services or psychiatric clinic.
Good luck. Always rememver the setting sun is a promise for tomorrow   ",1
"Hi Nemo, I struggle with my weight through medication also. I know you say that diet and exercise don't seem to work but they should just slowly. The best advice I can offer is to increase protein, fruit (grapefruit is a natural fat burner) , vegetables (iron rich leafy greens), swap simple carbohydrates for complex ones, saturated (trans fats) for unsaturated fats (rapeseed oil has the lowest content of saturated fat and also helps reduce cholesterol), green teas, Acai berry supplement, raspberry key tones supplements, probiotics to aid your digestive system, switch to dark chocolate (but don't eat it before bed or your body will store it as fat, a small eaten in the morning has proven benefits) and most importantly drink as much water throughout the day as you can (I fill a jug and put sliced limes, lemons and ginger root in then stick it in the fridge, it's really tasty and good for you). Hope this helps! ~VW~",1
"It has different effects for different people. Don't let some image scare you. Although, Abilify did not work for me so I had to switch meds.",1
"The only thing it gave me was major panic attacks I would hyperventilate , sweat, vomit, shake, get dizzy",1
Truvision works Belinda Piketru try ths stuff message this girl the stuff is amazing i dont really have to worry about anti depressant as much !,1
I took it and ended up with a nonstop twitching and tingling in my legs. It was horrible.  My doctor told me to stop immediately and now I take restless leg medicine when needed. Never had that issue prior to this medicine. My mom took it and had no issues-worked great for her. We all respond differently.,1
when it first started I remember having to stand at my desk at work and just stomp my feet. It was such a miserable feeling,1
Dont worry i went through the same thing your not the only one it always used to happen after i had dinner of a night,1
I was on it for a few months and noticed I started struggling to focus on simple tasks at work. I felt like I could conquer the world but not plan how to do it. I stopped and I began to be able to think clearly again. I refuse to take it again no matter what.,1
I suffered lots of side effects.... none listed here but were dangerous and scary.,1
I've been there done that he put me on the wrong dosage and I was so dizzy and lightheaded etc. I  couldn't sleep or stay up so I shaked back and forth in bed till it wore off felt like I was going to die so I never toke it again  don't get me started on other sexual side effects it caused good times :P    ,1
"Of course. Lots of people have very negative reactions to Aripiprazole. I was one of them. Abilify and Celexa were the first two antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications I was prescribed when I was diagnosed ten years ago. Together they made me gain 40 pounds, increased my agitation and made me suicidal. I've since taken several genetic tests and determined my resistance to the drugs is primarily genetic and biochemical. I can't handle SSRIs and many antipsychotics. I have friends and family members who have successfully managed their depression with the same drugs that were terrible for me. Dozens of medications later, I am still trying to find the right combination for me. I know many people who have seen life-changing results for the better after taking these medications under strict clinical guidance. The most important thing is to see a professional on a consistent basis to monitor your medications, or better yet, several well-trained and credible psychiatrists and psychotherapists who have extensive experience and knowledge of the effects of these drugs so they can prescribe them with caution. Make sure your doctors are up-to-date with the most recent pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. Psychiatric research is always evolving and drugs are constantly being tested as new information becomes available about their effects.",1
HORRIBLE MEDICATION!!!! Akathisia!,1
this stuff gave me seizures and i had no control over my eye movements... scary stuff,1
"I was on Aripiprazole (Abilify) for a considerable length of time. I credit my psych AND THIS DRUG for allowing me to become the person I am today. It essentially saved my life!
I find the fact that people who experienced side effects may be eligible for compensation disconcerting.... am I eligible for compensation based on the side effects I encountered whilst on other medication before I found what worked for me? I very much doubt it. These side effects are listed in the data sheet and crucially what works for some may not suit others.",1
Same here and Im literally still shaking my legs my mom used to put her hand on my knee to help me stop but I couldn't all my boyfriends notice it when ee are in bed. I attempted suicide on it as well due to ither circumstances at yhe time also but I actually went through with b yhe attempt still have the scar. My impulse control was null and void and I was agitated all the time. School was next to impossible to deal with and I'm still lost as ever.,1
Dude I ran across the interstate during rush hour. I took off to Connecticut with a boy I had just met. I think back to how many times I ran away and got into the car with strangers and all the risky fucked up shit I did...like how the Fuck did I not die? And you know when I got better? When I stopped taking that shit after being on it for 4 years.,1
I had gambling problems.. I was always buying scratchers... But I had really bad muscle tremors.. my left arm shook constantly and it was starting to effect my right arm.. it too was getting to the point of being more so then not.. and as an artist losing the ability to draw and write is my biggest fear... And that medicine was getting in the way if that.... So I just quite taking everything and only smoked weed..  now I'm the happiest I've ever been in life,1
I hate these scare tactics.,1
"Yep, I had all but uncontrollable muscle movement. It really messed up my life and I've been trying to rebuild what's left of it. My old psych pushed so hard for me to be on it.",1
Thanks everyone for your input. I found out it was the start of a panic attack (weird because they don't usually start that way for me) I took clonazepam and it relaxed me and my breathing went back to normal.,1
I get a heavy chest when anxiety and panic start,1
"It says "" I'm a Queen "" with a semicolon because I've battled for so long with depression, anxiety disorder, etc... "" I'm a Queen"" because queens are strong, independent, and amazing. But they still can ask for help when needed.",1
Having many symptoms again things have gotten very stressful and I've already blown up several times this week,1
"I'm always hungry, but too nauseous to eat. Always tired but can't sleep, scared to be alone but people, in general, are too stressful to be around. I wish it would just freaking stop.",1
Brenda Speth Balleza yeah can't tell you how many relationships it has strained because I don't know my anger is going nuclear unless someone points it out to me.  It's actually the only warning I get that I'm starting an anxiety attack :(,1
Acute vs. Chronic...I will never take xanex again tho. We are all different and there are many mixes that work praying you find yours. The struggle is real!!,1
It is a struggle but please remember your not alone . My son described it to his mates like I wake up tigger or eeyore ever need to talk pm me,1
I'm struggling today. Thank you for this.,1
"Its only a sufferer u knows wat it feels lyk. BT wen non sufferers say, Wat getting hyper for, Wat u worrying? That's wen I lyk to take my sandals and hit them",1
I need to share this to my family they don't understand depression and anxiety,1
"All I know if it wasn't for the Lord I would have gassed my self. But he stepped in and took control of my fears and paranoia. Which was very bad at that time. I also has a character that I created for my self, when I was in mania. Her name was. Because she is also laid to rest now, in any case I called her the white princess of Africa. It had to do with my faith. He set me free from what person  I created.",1
"There's never a testimony without a test. God will turn your mess into a message. A setback is a setup for a comeback. You must not turn your back on God. Lots of people wonder why they are stuck in certain situations, but God really does mend your brokenness. No matter how bad the situation gets, you ought to praise God no matter what. You have to believe that the works of the enemy will be exposed and destroyed. Focus on the good in your life, pray, do your best, and don't worry about the rest.",1
"I'm not sure how people survive.  I just got laid off  from. Work so I'm really struggling right now.  To much time in my head and I it's not good. 
Maybye some social programs can help you with legal help.",1
I have a lawyer. Have since first denial. I am a single mom with unreliable child support. I tried to go back to work in May of last year and missed 16 of 40 working days before being fired. My family has done all they can. My mom is fighting cancer and has her own bills.  I suffer from major depressive disorder with anxiety and possible ptsd dendacies with chronic migraines. I have not been hospitalized because someone has to take care of my kid even if I'm in bed all day atleast I am here.,1
"Oh My.......No CODDLING goin on......Fckn social media can bring out the ""Harshness"" in people. Being kind & gentle is not Molly Coddling! Some of us are just more gentle than others. Just Remember.....sometimes ""harsh, suck it up"" comments can be enough to push a vulnerable person Over the Edge!!! Please Think a little before you Post! What doesnt affect you could be devastating to someone else!!!!!   ",1
I agree Lori I personally found that remark uncalled for and a bit upsetting. People really aught to choose their words a bit more wisely on social media particularly on a page such as this,1
"I think when people are too mentally ill to function or even get out of bed the statement of ""put your big girl panties on'  can be a very damaging statement. Yes we are all sick here, yes it's all different degrees. We've been told our whole lives to quote ""Suck it up"" and it it's a very deep cord for some of us and can seem extremely insensitive. Always be aware that you never know what other peoples struggles are",1
Anyone thats gona Patronise someone with struggles should keep their stuff to themselves....we all have different Struggles. United we should stand!!!,1
Awwwe....come on guys.....go easy on each other Pleeeease. People do not post on here to be berated by others & told to get on with it.....I too am currently not working because of it & its a damn struggle. Maybe sending LOVE & Good Wishes to each other is what suffers need. Lots of LOVE 2 you Felicia       ,1
"Well I'm so glad u found it that easy and u done that. I am not one of those people unfortunately, there is no way I can work a job at this moment in time and I haven't for a number of years. That doesn't mean I'm not a big girl, I also am a mother to 6 children, I feel a failure as a mother every day of my life because my illness impacts so hugely on family life. I STILL cannot get up and go to work despite having my kids. It's a struggle for me to just get up to feed them some days. I have bipolar, borderline personality disorder, chronic anxiety and PTSD . It's a living hell",1
"I understand Felicia, I'm a single mom n with enough physical n emotional conditions to need n want to stop working daily...but I have to feed my daughter n keep a roof over her head. Every day is a constant struggle but luckily I'm still going.",1
I filed for disability last July. Denied in Nov and filed my judge appeal in Dec. Still waiting :( Luckily my bf has barely been keeping us going. It's extremely difficult. I've even tried to go back to work because I was frustrated and ended up having a severe panic attack and flipping out before my first day. Just can't do it anymore. I'd do anything to have the old me back. :(,1
i personally had a horrible reaction to latuda. doctor stopped it immediately and started me on seroquel xr.,1
I have disabling bipolar II and these comments really show how differently medications work for different people. They tried to give me Latuda for my attituda and I had a horrible reaction. I wandered from room to room not knowing what to do unable to think logically. The only thoughts that were going through my head was if this is life I don't want to live it. i'm very very resistant to try new medications because of Latuda. They're trying to talk me into lemactil now,1
My son has depressed but he didn't want to tske meds he was on something but it's hard to try and make s 20 old tske his meds very stressful for me at times cause I didt no how to help him I am on zofol he's doesn't want to tsk gl no one so we're do I turn for help for him,1
"I am bipolar 2 an also a spring depressive. When I say depression everyone says ""oh it must be so hard all winter. I just hate it. Tough to spend every winter so down. You must have S. A. D. Me:  not at all. I love winter!  They never understand. I always feel best in October. Get jobs in November and lose them by May. That was before meds but I still struggle every march-April to prevent a full episode",1
I can't remember what I was on but I was having nightmares of my pawpaw and I was waking up around 2 or 3 in the morning staying up til bout 8 or so in the morning then go to sleep. My doctor had to change it and then I switched doctors and I got put on celexa for my anxiety and depression,1
Suicide ideation and intrusive thoughts which is what you are describing are not a reason to be committed to hospital. But you should explain them to your therapist as they can be extremely unsettling especially when they are so vivid or won't go away which is very distressing and not under your control. They are a symptom of how you are feeling and I'm sure talking about them will give you some relief.,1
"Anxiety can cause intrusive thoughts, things you would never actually do or that dont make sense. They are vivid and can be very scary but they are the result of the chemicals in your brain working differently. Your therapist should be someone you trust. If you can't trust him or her, then find a new one. Good luck!",1
Exactly what is happening to me most nights but I literally keep it to myself cause I believe anything I say can be twisted to my therapist they try to heal what they sometimes can't understand unless they go thru it ...they have papers that say they are professionals in curing or help cope what we go thru but personally some things are meant to be unsaid if u personally feel like this isn't something that is going to occur in life right it in a journal is alot safer and less stress worrying if what u say can backlash at u..don't take my statement as advice it's just something that I do to protect myself from being taken for certain words I say in front of someone that has the power to say I'm incapable of going home,1
"Some meds give me weird vivid dreams but dont worry, dreams dont count.",1
"Pretty sure they can only do that if you admit you want or plan to harm yourself. If you explain to your therapist your dreams just how you did here, I'm sure it will be ok. I can't imagine how stressful and unsettling those dreams must be. It would be good to talk to her about it.",1
"It's like people don't even read, it's more of the lying to her clearly. Saying he wants to but lying about it.
And the fact that their relationship has changed and he's clearly not invested in it.
I have no advice.  I live by the rule of do I spend more days happy than sad. If not what's the point.  For me it got to the point I wanted to kill myself I felt so horrible.  There's something to be said for having stability,especially for kids but if y'all are miserable and not connected they pick up on that.  A conversation needs to happen clearly though.  Focus on facts not feelings.",1
"I have the same problem it's hard  I had an episode in Feb where I didn't sleep for 11 days I was not medicated bc I lost days in my mind I ended up being so paranoid that I went crazy on my loved ones had a break between fantasy and reality I went off on his mom and my entire family . Now he seems embarrassed to b w me she won't forgive me and everyone thinks we should break up.,I have multiple diagnosis but he has a hard time understanding them. We have been together 8 yrs he drank a lot but now is sober I want to marry him but I'm not sure I'm ready to explain my illness to everyone who already have me labeled as crazy . I have said sorry and that it won't happen again I knoe my triggers and symptoms and have a lot of support and have help to get through the bad days . Don't know if it's to broken or worth saving . Life is hard enough and I can't beg anymore for forgiveness.",1
"I understand about getting married. Especially since you've been engaged that long. It's like, why propose in the first place if he didn't plan on marrying you? If he can't do that then it's a show of not being able to commit. And now that he's changed? Idk. I would sit down and have a long talk with him about his intentions and where he wants to be with you. And why he doesn't wanna get married. Communication is everything. Don't let the anxiety talk for you either. Write down the points you wanna talk about while in a clear mind.",1
If he treats you and the kids good then don't worry about getting married.  It's how he supports you and the kids that is most important,1
Yep!  It's worse when I'm stressed out. :/,1
I use Cannabis. It really helps me. No pain. No depression. No anxiety. No bad side effects.,1
Firstly why did you stop? You also don't say what meds you were taking. It's not a good idea to just suddenly stop. Some meds have dreadful withdrawal symptoms and you really should gradual dose reduction over a few weeks.,1
"I agree I write letters and I keep a diary, due to some days I cant remember what I was upset and angry for. ...bless you sweetie xx",1
"Thank you. That's one of my biggest struggles... I'm like this, but not depressed :/",1
"It's so so hard. It is also hard to advise or even suggest what worked for others as your individual case is just that.  I just know that when you are feeling as bad as you obviously are and can't see the wood for the trees it is so difficult to know what to do for the best.  For my recovery the first major step was acceptance and I suspect you are at that stage where you are fully aware of your illness and are not pretending to yourself or others.  The next step is taking responsibility for yourself and your recovery which you are now trying to do.  These are major steps which you should feel proud of and are far from easy to embrace and admit.  Many live with mental illness in relative secrecy so if you do have people who care and you care about it must help, but it must be so tough for those around you, but I'm sure they will do all they can however hard it is.  At the end of the day you all want the same thing to get you well.
I felt I wanted to escape, I think that's quite common.  Not, not to be here, but to escape from the torment and pain.  To escape that torment, the answer is to get better, there is hope which you must hold on to.  I had months, day after day on the sofa, today I can enjoy the tiny things.  There is hope.  Unfortunately it isn't easy to recover, it's a long, hard road, but ultimately I think we all have the strength.  I had to do it alone, no one knew, or if they did, they didn't care enough.  I was adamant I wouldn't take anti depressants, see a counsellor or take sleeping tablets.  I was frightened and not in control, in the end I took the lot.  Recovery from mental depression is often a huge mixture of small steps, whatever works best for you. If you have loved ones, lean on them, let them help.  It's down to small steps, achievable goals, when you are ready, try to come up with a plan, small, but significant steps to move forward and get you better.  Try to pinpoint what isn't working, what you need to change, take each day as it comes, be kind to yourself, people need you and love you, you can do this for them, but mainly for you, there is light, there is colour, there is hope xxx",1
"I am against meds, but it will be the best for you to be reevaluated by a different psychiatrist with a new approach. Give the ""quick release"" meds a week or two (you will be sleepy and relaxed) and if you don't feel better I would try a short term hospital stay, preferably private room, (noise and lots of people might escalate your anxiety). Long term meds will kick in, in 7 weeks and by then you should feel almost human. Cognitive therapy is of utmost importance, psychiatrist usually work hand and hand with a psychologist. 6 months and your a for a way. ***I find the Holistic approach favorable, takes much longer  but it works. Research: Scio Health4Life Natural Healers Associations. GOOD LUCK, your not alone, you will get better, believe in yourself. Hope, love, faith.",1
"It sounds like you are very blessed to have a husband and friend that care so much. Worry about you right now,get the help,you will be happy you did in long run. Wish you the best!",1
"I'm so sorry your going through all of this. Your hubby and bf LOVE you,  and only want the best for you. They dont want you to hurt any more. You need to go, and hopefully you won't feel quite so bad. Just remember you are loved by your family, your bf, and by all of us❤. Just hang in there, and get the help you so desperately need., please.  ❤",1
It hurts but usually if it's a good hospital it helps a lot. If you cut yourself you going. Husband can take care of horse for a few days. If I didn't have 200 things to do I think I'd admit myself. Ups and downs. Hate living but my family is everything. Depressed severely or manic and confused,1
It is Possible But if that's not your diagnosis then don't get extra worried about it. Let the doctor do his job about diagnosis and you work on getting better. Take your meds and go to therapy. If your meds aren't working right get an appointment for a change,1
Side effect I experienced most was shakiness and severe tremors... once dose was lowered it went away. Otherwise it works well... no suicidal thoughts.,1
Worst ones for me are the shaking and the nausea.,1
"My son was on it for years with good results, screwed up his thyroid and much later on gave him horrible acne, almost boils on his back.  After years it quit working, then there is the blood tests but I would say it is worth a shot in taking, some people know right away if they can't take it because of the blood work.",1
I liked lithium but it gave me nightmares/night terrors.,1
"I couldn't keep it down. 
I would take it and then 5-10 minutes later vomit. It was miserable.",1
Make sure to have blood levels checked if you take Lithium. Mine wasn't being monitored and overdosed for 3months with alot of uncontrollable vomiting.,1
"Lithium worked great for me until I found out I was pregnant. After I was done breastfeeding I got back on and it was horrible for me, severe insomnia, hallucinations, couldn't drive, vision changes",1
I was lithium for almost 10yrs & i never had a problem . But every person is different. On kilodopin for anxiety & albilify for paranoia ..good luck..,1
"paranoia and anxiety both were largely increased on lithium. suidical thoughts for me were daily too. lithium and Depakote were terrribleeeeeee for my mental and physical health, but everyone is different.. ive heard more bad then good about lithium though",1
"be careful, im no doctor but that sounds like a very scary mix! i wish u the best",1
"I really struggled with this for years. I didnt take vacation because I didn't think single people did that. My psychiatrist convinced me to go on a regular cruise and that really opened up my perspective. I can have fun by myself because I push myself to meet at least one new person wherever I went. Just one person was not overwhelming. When I got home, I applied the same principal. I meet one new person at the grocery store aisle, in the checkout line, at the park, at church or the movies. Its really surprising how friendly and reassuring that one person can be.",1
Idk. Struggle with this myself,1
"Hello Colin....i.m 56 I,ve had Mental health probs all my life....I hated bein single n alone. But I leanrt to love bein alone. Music is a great way of distressing. Watchin comedys is also great......It really boils down to being happy in ur own skin......Once u,ve mastered that, n enjoy ur life it will attract peeps to u.......Keep strong xox",1
"Ativan is a dangerous medication. If you are prone to addiction at all or not, it is very addicting. I had a horrible time withdrawing from it after attempts to end the pain. It builds up in the fat cells in the body and requires more and more to feel better. Medication can help many, but benzodiazepines are not  a good choice. Some may be able to comply and not take more than prescribed but it is still damaging. I am not a doctor, but one who has a lot of experience from the last 15 years. As you can see, I feel very strongly about ativan. I wish the best for all of you hurting. It can get better, please continue to fight it.",1
"But for many it does work. If any medication is causing an issue you have to address that with your psych doctor. And yes I know it's hard sometimes. I have bipolar 1, anxiety, PTSD and personality disorder. Bipolar since childhood",1
"I too, am a survivor of suicide attempts, 2 in fact. What gets me is, whenever there is some ""celebrity"" that actually succumbs to the thoughts that many of us have known, it gets horribly blown up in the media. 

For those of us who have survived, every time this happens, there is a range of emotions that you experience. You can talk to your therapist, but somehow it just isn't enough. 

What I am trying to do is start a Suicide Attempt Survivor group that would be led either by a therapist or social worker. I am trying to work out the details with the agency where I have my social worker. Both my therapist and my social worker thought it was a great idea. There are groups for families who have lost a loved one but not for us. 

I think it is time for one",1
"Psychiatric meds do cause more harm than good I was on some and it caused, sleepiness, disorientation, slurred speech, nasty taste in mouth, sporadic behavior, uncontrollable communication or actions depending on p",1
Its very important especially wth bi-polar with panic attacks/anxiety and depression that you take your medication that works right for you. Do never throw yr meds away and stop. You will eventually go worse till its very serious situation. Stay well and take your medication without fail.,1
"I am saddened by his passing, but hope it will help some have conversations with loved ones, friends, and their doctors about their medications, risks, and treatment plans.",1
"I think unfortunately we live in an age where its easier and more common to ask for advice on a social media page rather than get correct information from a professional health care worker.  I see so many people asking for help or advice on medications on facebook and i cant help but to think ""why dont you just ask a psychiatrist""  sadly, i think this is due to the fact that MANY people all across the world do not have easy or affordable access to mental health professionals.  Australia, NZ, USA and MANY more countries i have lived in have very poor support for people with mental health issues.   My advice is this.  ALWAYS check with a doctor before changing dosage or stopping any medication.  I know that many medications can cause increased risk of depression, anxiety or suicidal thoughts, but there are also many that dont.. it takes time to find the right medication sometimes and it can be a tedious process. I also am a suicide survivor and speaking for myself, i wouldnt be here without my medications..  Keep fighting the good fight people !",1
"Yes, you could very well call the members of this site a community because we all have something in common.  Would you be offended if you were a red Sox fan and the announcer referred to you as being part of red Sox nation?  I highly doubt it",1
Are you being medication compliant? Do you have a rescue plan for anxiety attacks?,1
My goal is to one day not need so much medicine. My doctor has told me she has no other meds I've tried them all. I don't trust all in meds. I've decided when I get the time to go back to yoga. I obviously have anxiety from all the years of abuse from child good until an early adult.,1
Yeah I usually am good about taking my meds. The pharmacy took forever to fill my depression meds Because they had to get a pre authorization. If I'm not taking them I become maniac and high on life. My counselor knows when this occurs. Let's see... When I have anxiety attacks usually I take my pill or I breathe or I shake until it goes away by talking myself out of it,1
"This is something I post alot about Because it helps me alot.. is medical marijuana... If you do the right research and really look into it it could really help you.. like most Medicine you do need to be careful when first trying it... As it is not for everyone...  
I have an overwhelming amount of loss and trauma in my life and it's the only thing I use Because I have problems with ingesting things to hurt myself...so if you haven't already it might be something to look into ..",1
"Do you go to counseling or therapy to help you cope and work on your grief?? I would do that first and foremost.
Then get into an AA place, stop drinking, its not benefiting you on anyway shape or form. 
From their work with your doctor  or psychiatrist to cut down on some of those added medications that you might not need. once you're in counseling and able to deal with anxiety and grief and also with the drinking because that's doing a number on your system as well. I can't understand what you're going through. But I have been addicted to drugs in the past and then on multiple antidepressants and anti-anxiety pills, which I am no longer on. If anything from where anybody is suggesting to you and trying to help please get into counseling and if you don't like your first counselor find another one it's totally worth it. It's hard, it's frustrating, it brings up feelings you don't want to face , but it's totally worth it to gain your sanity and your self-worth and a purpose in life",1
Im a mixed bipolar with severe anxiety. But my mental dr put me on Latuda which has helped me a great deal.,1
You just have to find one that works for you. I tried 4 for my anxiety til I found one that worked.,1
"This is my story, thanks for your reply. I always had anxiety and bi polar but after my son was diagnosed  was when depression really hit",1
"Also, do you exercise ? I found that to help so so much with my anxiety and depression and even my mood swing from my personality disorder. 

I stopped taking meds completely for 13 months due to the seroquel giving me memory loss and a stutter and I felt 100x better than I ever did on meds. I started taking a multi vitamin and exercising daily and I was feeling great. 

The only reason I'm back on mertazapine is to help me sleep because I have really bad insomnia. But it also helps majorly with my anxiety so if I feel anxious I wil take a med that day and be better. 

I don't take them every day.",1
"In my opinion, get off the seroquel. That shit is so bad for your brain. 

I found it made everything in my life worse. Harder to deal with emotions, harder to control my mood swings, have me memory loss and caused me to stutter. 
The only thing it helped me with was sleep and even then I was seeing shit and hearing shit in my sleep. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone. My uncle has schizophrenia and bipolar and I even told him to get off the shit. He's 50% better than he was on it. 
I highly recommend mertazapine for an anti anxiety/anti depressant as i to have tried many different one and this has worked the best for me. I have little to no anxiety most days. 

Everyone who I've told to try this have all had major turn around and good results. 

Everyone is different with medications but I think it's worth a try. 
Goodluck",1
I found Olanzapine 10mg and going gym works also avoiding alcohol.,1
Thuis is goed olanzapine??  Also for anxiety??    ,1
"I have never been in a  long term love relationship and i'm 37, they just last a few weeks and they can't handle the darkness. So I just completely stopped looking for a partner, and without any real friends around, i started focusing on what i can do on my own. I started on a healthy diet, cooking good healthy food, I go for walks every other day down by the seaside with some dark  (not sad) music, the sight of big waves crashing violently on the rocks calms me down.
As for a relationship, i think it might come my way, maybe not, i believe stressing about it won't help me but it will drag me further deep into depression.
I hope my short story helped. Good luck   ",1
welcome to the group i am bipolar have social anxiety ptsd and last week was diagnosed with stomach cancer i am scared too but keep the faith this is a good group to talk to my meds make me sick too so i keep trying new ones i have been bipolar since i was in my teens so i understand you just plz keep your faith that you will get better i do and take your meds and when you need to talk post on this page,1
"Lamictal gave me a rash. I had the worst reaction to geodon that you can have, it effected my speech and coordination, thank God I was in the hospital when I was on it. Got a shot to counter act the effects. Scary!!",1
"I had the bad rash reaction to lamictal which made me sad, because within 2 weeks I was feeling more stable and happier. I tried geodon but it not only did nothing for my moods it flared up acute pancreatitis. So I am back to taking only xanax to manage my anxiety and also helps curb my hypomania a bit.",1
Lamictal and geodon. Geodon worked but the withdrawls were horrible and lasted forever,1
"I took Wellbutrin but after about two years it began making me extremely anxious. But it was great at the beginning, and I don't think that's a typical reaction. I've been on Neurontin (gabapentin) for several years. It's been really great for stabilizing overall, but I really need to find a good antidepressant again, one that will help with anxiety. I also have ADD but my last psychiatrist said I shouldn't be talking stimulants, so I'm kind of a mess. Hopefully I can get some changes made.",1
Don't let your boyfriend continue to rule your life if he had chosen to leave you. From your post I'm guessing  you are fairly young. Are you still living at home? With a baby on the way you need support from family and friends. Don't ignore them ask for support its nothing to be ashamed about.,1
Why are you stuck at home? Think of who you have for support and find comfort in them instead of someone whos trying to control you. If hes choosing to leave you dont let him visit whenever he feels like it. Thats not fair to you. You dont need stress while growing a baby ♡,1
I have bipolar 1 my bf of 15 years since we met has a hard time wants me to do more . On my good days I can do half of what I used to I often grieve for my old self but w several diagnosis I have to come to grips w this awful illness . It's something you can't explain we been to many Drs. And it seems the older people are just don't get it at all . They think I'm lazy mean even faking it . I'm glad for this site the more it's talked about more awareness comes. Everyday is a struggle .,1
The medication abilify 5 or 10mg changed my life. It helps with paranoia I know I am a very paranoid bi polar patient. After taking if for a month I was able to work through the emotions that I internalize and bottled but. BUT WHAT DOESN'T HELP IS A PARTNER WHO IS NOT SUPPORTIVE.,1
"I'd tell my husband there's the door don't let it hit ya in the ass on your way out!!     I have bipolar,severe depression and bad anxiety and I told my husband I really don't give a flying fuck how my husband feels about my issues cause I'm sure the son of a bitch is probably cheating on me we r not even in the same state!!",1
"I'm so sorry.  I have depression/anxiety and I believe I'm BP2.  I hate my job and want to do something else but have settled for staying with it unitl I just can't do it anymore.  Luckily, my wife is very supportive but she wasn't so much last year and the year before.  She was tired of me and threatened me unless I got help.  Maybe, if you could give your husband another chance and talked with him about how you really feel he might be able to be more thoughtful and supportive.  I hope so.",1
i am so sorry i am bipolar 2 also and i know what you are going through my husband did not understand either been through the psychiatrist explained everything to him he said there was nothing wrong with me and after 20 yrs of marriage we got divorced and i too had a terrible time atwork the medications make me sick i have ptsd social anxiety fibromyalgia and severe rheumatoid arthritis i finaly got my disability      and amstilltrying to survive,1

"A feeling of muscle quivering, restlessness, and inability to sit still, sometimes a side effect of antipsychotic or antidepressant medication.",1
I had it big time along with restless leg on latuda. It started about 1 month into taking it so I stopped and it resolved immediately,1
"Yes. I've had akathisia on Latuda and several other meds. It's horrible. My pdoc prescribed cogentin for it, but it didn't work for me, so I had to switch anti-psychotics. I'm on Rexulti now and haven't had akathisia at all.",1
Thank you so much for the comments and advice everyone; I am really overwhelmed by the support.,1
"I have rapid cycling bipolar. I think everyone with bipolar has the chance of a sudden rapid cycling (circumstances, environment, moon phase, time of year, hormones) if its not normal for you then makes someone close to you aware of what's happening. Its hard to keep track and you will not see the shift yourself. Its okay. Just breathe if that's all you can do, concentrate on that and the loud fast rushing will get quieter. If you havnt experienced it before, it is very frightening. Try writing whenever you can, then when your well sift through it all. You will remember the days and maybe be able to start identifying sign and your own red flag behaviours that signal a change. I hope someone close is helping you through, try and keep people in your loop. Take care. L x",1
Twice a year I rapid cycle just like this. I've been diagnosed with bi polar since 14 and am now 33. I've also been diagnosed with schizo effective disorder agoraphobia ocd and anxiety and I am now on tygretol and wellbutrin xl and have been stable for almost 2 years but recently have had the psychosis return and been put on sulpheris  (sorry spelling that one sucks) I totally get ya so many different combos so much happening. I hate it the spinning but with meds and support we will all get through it. Hugs n positive thoughts your way.,1
"I had rapid cycling bipolar. The swings are unbelievable. Just one straight after the other. My depression never lasted long or never happened at all because I was straight back up there. I appeared to drop from full blown mania to hyper mania then back up again. I was put on olanzapine lithium and an anti depressant. Can't remember which one, I've been on that many. These meds sent me totally the other way. I was a zombie. Anxiety and depression really bad. Just could not lift my depression at all. And the anxiety was so bad I wanted to die.  Any way. After trying lots of different types of mood stabilisers and anti depressants I have now found what suits me. I too am on lamotragine also risperidone and my antidepressants is venlofaxine. I feel better than I ever have. I still have bouts be just mild. It took a long time to get there and I thought I never would. Keep taking the lamotragine and hopefully it will be your saviour too. Good luck x",1
Honey get out and  distress your baby needs that,1
First thing don't get overwhelmed change the small things u can manage first break it down to small tasks some are unchangeable erase all guilt and/ or self pity start with ur daughter and dogs look on the bright side wen u can for instance no water damage that could have been worse make urself happy before you begin to look for sumbody.  Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  Not preaching i jus know were u are at.  Get out in the sun around nature and people we  don't want our children seeing us like that it can be a learned behavior.  Hope I helped at all.,1
"We're listening!    It seems like you're going though a lot right now. Do you have a psychotherapist? I find it's really helpful talking to someone who understand mental illness. She makes it about me and my feelings as a person, not my illness, and helps me find ways to cope and deal with stress so I can stay grounded. I suggest psychotherapy to help you through this difficult time.",1
"That's a lot of things to be dealing with. All at once. Without enough money. Or enough support. It must feel overwhelming. You have a lot of responsibilities and things you are trying to solve but you need help. I'm not sure how to help but I think some of it will work out somehow if you have a little patience. First one thing will be solved, then another, until you are in a different situation and state of mind. It may not seem possible to solve these problems now because so much is happening at once. But things will change. It is so great that you rescued two pitbulls. That is a wonderful thing for you to do. They aren't always so lucky to have someone like you helping them. Keep on helping them, and loving your daughter, one day at a time. The other stuff is less important. Make sure you are on some good medications that work for you because you need to be stable while going through these challenges.",1
"Hi there. So sorry for all your troubles. With so many anxieties you're dealing with, negative circumstance will only add to your dilemma. You seem very confuse even on little things. And I understand because of the mental illness. I would suggest a simple step. It's still up to you, though, since you know yourself better than I do. 

(1) Get a piece of paper and write down all your problems
(2) Put big problems, small problems in a column and think through which one you want to prioritize first, then second, third and so on

This might seem silly to you but our perspective normally change when we see in writing that some problems are not really worth worrying too much about. And yet some problems also needs quick action on our part. ❤️

This might help as well. See the link. Take care ❤️

"Sounds like you need to visit the doctor, you seem a bit confused, you could be bipolar but you're not actually very clear about what you're saying. Go and see the doctor and have a talk.",1
"I think she wants to know she's not alone and that someone cares, maybe get some advice from others in similar high stress situations about how to deal everything she's going through.    ",1
"She's speaking about her battles & looking for some comforting words if not suggestions to help her situation. Compassion never hurt anyone, every person who is a part of this page would appreciate this. I find your comment unnecessary. ""If you don't know what she's asking, if anything"" don't comment, if it were on my post I'd be upset!",1
"I would just say to you it is very early days and it is normal to be looking at the service sheet etc, you are coming to terms with your very sad loss and you are probably in so much shock you think it is a nightmare you will wake up from.  You don't want it to be real.  If you are struggling then contact a bereavement association or councillor,  its never weak to ask for help it is our strength that permits us to admit we are struggling.  Even medication can help you through.  But remember it is very early days, a week is no time at all.",1
"Yes, I had sever post-partum depression after my second child.  It was the scariest thing I ever went through.  I did not have this when my daughter was born.  I have always had depression.  But when my son was born it was unbelievable.  I had thoughts of wanting to kill my own son!  I wanted him to be another girl.  I knew that this was NOT ME. But I could not stop the thoughts from coming.  Luckily we had a close friend that was a Neurologist that told my husband to get me to the doctor right away.  It still took almost 8 months for me to recover on meds.  I could not remember how to write my own name.  If I showered, I could not remember if I washed my hair or put on my conditioner.  Please get to a psychiatrist and begin treatment for this right away. It can get worse. It is dangerous for you and your child or children. Feel free to message me if you need to talk.  Don't wait to care for yourself.  You need to care for yourself first, so that you can care for other 's later.",1
That pretty much sums up my PTSD & anxiety!,1
Funny these all fit we are more anxious due to the fact that we see and understand more of what we see going on around us and it stresses us.,1
"Seriously, I have always thought my ability to think reasonably clearly in very chaotic and stressful environments was a very minor superpower. I thought it was due to being brought up by doctors and nurses but this suggests my neurodiversity might be part of the reason (recent ADD diagnosis added to anxiety and depression).",1
"ADHD, anxiety and depression whuuuut? why am I not the best damn person in the world yet? XD",1
"Creativity comes in lots of forms, it's not just about drawing or playing piano    (anxiety, depression and ADD mean I am a compassionate and creative problem solver)",1
It really is . I have had personal experience of this it's very frightening !!!,1
Panic attacks anxiety attacks is not good im just thankful my medication works cause mine get so bad I end up at the er,1
"Thanks Sagaren, l'm so happy that you found the strength to conquer the feelings of insecurity and lack of self worth. I pray that through your post above many will see a seed they can plant and are able to implement the three steps to self healing. We need our meds perhaps for the rest of our lives but as with diabetes or hypertension, our minds may need these too. These various chemicals are critical to stabilize the much needed balance and hopefully we find that balance. The rest is up to us and even more critical l believe we have to stop all the inward-directed thoughts. I have.. I have... I have (sorry everyone). Sure we have.. 
But with the practice you outline above we can begin to make even one small shift in our minds. One small shift of mindset today followed by another small shift next month.. Followed by more and more and bringing some small degree of happiness to ourselves!  All by ourselves. What an achievement! Go tell your doc/psych what you've achieved, tell your family - no, SHOW them the new you! You have the power, it lies within the mind that makes you dwell on the negatives. Try, hard, to be kind to yourself, learn to love yourself, find the happiness and joy that lies  within you. Sending everyone struggling and hurting all my love, I shall keep you in my prayers. Love and showers of blessing, film <3 <3",1
"I'll ask a question to answer: do you notice any thought patterns, activities, times of day, places you go where you notice your mood shifts dramatically? Or is it more sporadic? I believe (do your own research) that the former is normal in people with BPD and features in bipolar II, not AS familiar with PTSD yet but I'm starting my own research on that one...

However you would know yourself best and if this feels different or worries you that it feels worse than usual, hit up your therapists & medical team for advice",1

"I had it and anxiety too. Some people with post natal depression don't bond with their baby but I did. But you feel you're all alone and letting your baby down. You feel you're not a good mother. You think that everybody thinks you're a bad mother. You cry all the time. My anxiety meant I would not let my baby out of my sight. I wouldn't let my husband take him anywhere alone. If he did I would be pacing up and down unable to rest till he was back, crying all the time he was away from me. I felt that I would never see him again. That something would happen to him because I wasn't there to protect him. I hid it all away from the midwife and health visitor because I was frightened they'd take him off me. It was three years later when I was medicated for it. I had taken my son to the doctors and she noticed I didn't look right and asked me. It all came flooding out and she gave me some Prozac to help. So please don't leave it like I did. Go see your GP straight away  before it gets any worse. My son is 22 now but I remember the nightmare so clearly.  Hope you feel better soon. Good luck x",1
"Meds, love them or hate them, one needs them like a fish needs water. Or a diabetic needs insulin or blood pressure meds or anti inflammatories for arthritis. So whence the hate? Change that to necessity. Be creative. I hate the packets. I have two small lunchboxes. One with a sticker of a little girl watering her plants (am) and the other with her in her nightie (pm). I typed a list of each lot of meds plus how many and glued it to the inside of each lid (in case family needs to know.) I keep the tubs at the table where l watch tv and over the years have learned (after stopping twice) and suffering the awful outcomes, that l need these little things in order not to melt into a pile of bones. I know I need them during the day, but especially at night, to help me sleep. Sometimes l get into bed and just. can't. sleep. Then l realize ah ha! I forgot my evening meds. So make your meds containers pretty, accept that you have to take them, truly this will help you. Wishing you much happiness and stability <3",1

"Steps to loving yourself and living with this monster. Refuse to give him more power over your life. I hope you don't think me presumptuous with my posts but l've been in the darkest pit but am gratefully coping okay nowadays.

And oh how glorious that is. Wishing you lifetimes of sunshine <3 <3",1
"Been in both the jaws of this monster. Both of them very frightening but praise God and the help of two very inspirational people who constantly shot at me with bullets of powerful positive reinforcement , and gratefully the correct blend of meds and very patient listeners, one day I thought to myself, l have to change the conversations l'd been having with myself, change my internal dialogue. I was advised to find at least three things about myself that have merit/value or things I liked about myself. Tough one. 1. Even with the terrible highs and lows, my superior at the Military Hospital where l worked, once told me l have a charming disposition. Wow, it stuck with me. My ingenious and artistic gift :-o and my voice over the pa announcement system. Which gifts do you have? Write them down. Beautiful hair, Beautiful smile? Personality?  The gifts/blessings must be there. I promise. 
People?  Those who love you matter and those who don't understand or love you?  Make like a duck and shrug them off your shoulders and out of your life, don't waste a single moment trying to explain things. Be strong and resist, reject 
every single negative thought .

"Ok yes I get this but I have one point to make and please don't get too mad at me for this. Sometimes giving up on someone, even someone with a serious mental health issue that is in no way their fault, it the right thing to do. Not because the person isn't worth the time or effort to support and help them in any and every way you can. But because being with that person, whether being their friend or significant other, is physically or mentally damaging for you. I knew someone who had some serious issues that were in no way his fault + I wanted to help him and did everything I could to try and help him but being with him was seriously damaging for me. My mental health is in no way as bad as his but I still have issues with anxiety and depression and being in that relationship messed me up more than I could cope with so I ended up giving up because it was the only way out I could see where I didn't end up killing myself (something I'd been close to at times because of this person's actions). 
Tldr
 I'm not saying you shouldn't do anything you can to support people with mental health issues and be there for them to help them but if it is physically or mentally damaging for you then you shouldn't sacrifice your own health for someone elses. No matter how much you want to help them",1
"Yeah. But people without a mental illness don't seem to get it. They say they understand. But their patience dissolves into frustration. Which no doubt it's frustrating. But how much more is it for those with the illness. It's like with any illness, ailment, disease, disability, or limitation. It's hard to put yourself in that person's shoes. But it's always worse for them.",1
"That is so wonderful you have someone who understands and is supportive. I have bipolar disorder 1, as well as major depressive disorder, ptsd and panic attacks beyond normal.

Usa for you 1 off the most ill countries on earth and take more drugs than anyone else my friend was on strong depression tablets and he was so sad and down all the time i told him he will always be the same untill he quits them he was unsure at 1st he went down little by little ending on a quarter of a tablet now on nothing they have there social life back go out and is happy again,1
Is there anyone who can have the  children for a while. This is going to be affecting them badly. You need to try and get the best help u can. I would not dream of having another child I have one and feel guilty about situations. Do what you have to do to make life better but please don't put your kids in the firing line,1
I will always be on meds for my bi polar 1 and my anxiety and ptsd too til I die,1
I couldn't do with out my meds ..yes know the feeling can't go out today and getting on train or driving frightens me to dead.....feeling numb myself and yes no one understands...I only good thing is it will pass and your gone out the other side but it rules my life so isolating and a horrible feeling and illness....j,1
Go to your doctor with someone who cares for you. Going alone is scary I know. I've been there.,1

"This Zee person obviously doesn't know a single thing about the reason/origin of the causes of the various conditions of the mind. They are extremely complex in origin and after all the centuries of medical investigations and expertise the medical professionals can still only hazard a guess and experiment with the thousands of drugs available, to try to obtain a combination that works. Single parenthood???  Most certainly not. It's easy to be judgemental, until it strikes you!  So I would tread very lightly before another careless word is typed here.. It could just cause the push over an edge that for some of us is a very narrow one. I am bp2 after a severe head injury as a teenager and it changed my entire life...and has worsened as the years, stresses and misfortunes have taken their toll. So the stresses and misfortunes caused by the illness exacerbated the condition which caused more impulsive and wrong decisions, which led to more stress and misfortune. So please be careful what you say to someone, words, once they leave your mouth cannot be taken back and the effects they can have on many, may be an eternal sentence of doom. But I forgive you for your comments, ignorance is bliss but be warned...you may need our advice someday...",1
Sorry Zee... I'm the 33 year old I was married for 9 years 3 babies to that ONE MAN too may I add just in case bipola is caused by having kids to different men. My mother and father have been married for 41 years last Feb and she too also suffers depression and anxiety my father always by her side no matter what... So that marriage shit you can put it up your nose n blow it outta your bum.. Dumb things that come out of some peoples mouths can and will one day push that suicidal person over the edge.. Got nothing nice to say keep it to your self.. Hope to god you don't EVER be in a place not only am I in but 1000's of people too.,1
"Actually that's not true, I was a single mother with my oldest son for a while , I was so happy I can't ever remember being more happy, now I have two sons n am with my youngest sons father, he loves my oldest like his own, takes care of both the boys and me he's amazing ... But I'm miserable. Relationships can take a toll on bipolar people. Sometimes it's better not to be with someone. Kids or not",1

"I have been on bipolar meds, anti-depressants, anxiety meds, sleeping meds, adhd med, etc. Spent time in Amsterdam  (where its legal). Found that Marijuana treated all these problems. They are even more affective than what big pharm has to offer. Now that you don't have to smoke it. I  can't see any reason not to use it medically....except its illegal. Even if you qualify. The clinics need your other drs approval. I really don't see that happening too often. Most drs want to keep you as a repeat customer. So most drs aren't going to give approval.",1
I suffer from depression and anxiety usually lasts about three weeks but I try to focus on family and work before I got on meds I was a complete mess,1
"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder over a decade ago and I used to self medicate until it almost killed me. Now I'm taking a more holistic approach. Meditation has helped me immensely and is proven to lower stress levels and a ton of other benefits. That's the only thing I can recommend but I too sleep a lot and find it extremely hard to leave the house but the rage has definitely decreased a lot and I know it's bc of the meditation I do. I need to be more adamant about making it a daily practice instead of waiting til I'm way far off kilter and have to meditate my way back to sanity. But it does help to some degree. I just don't know if I can do the whole lab rat thing anymore. I've been on probably 40 + different meds over the years, sometimes 6-8 prescriptions at a time...and meditation has helped me more than any of them. I can only speak from my own experience but I think everyone can benefit from meditation and it's worth looking into. You might be surprised by what exactly meditation is...as well as what it isn't. Best wishes <3",1
"Honestly, my best resource has just been YouTube. I would start with a video called something like ""Buddhist monk explains meditation"" it's a really good place to start bc the video explains exactly what meditation is and isn't. If you can't find the video I'm speaking of, let me know and I'll find you the link. Meditation is a deeply personal thing and I think it should be customized to what serves each person best and the great part about it is, you can literally do it any time, during any activity. Its more about retraining your brain rather than trying to clear your mind of all thought. Feel free to add me as a friend and I'll help in any way I can. I know the struggle and if I can help lighten the load for one person or help them find some hope and peace, that would help me as much as them <3 hope you find this helpful",1
"Yes my thoughts exactly. I am on a lot of medication, and live with the side effects everyday because my 4 kids need a mum who is semi- functional. If I don't take me meds..... woaah- scary stuff can happen",1
"Not many Dr's prescribe lithium anymore as there are ""better,  newer "" ones.  My boyfriend's on lithium and the change has been amazing! We naturally have lithium in our brains but a lot of depression,  anxiety,  etc, comes from our lithium levels being outta whack.  Should definitely see a Dr and ask to get his levels checked and hopefully start him on it!",1
I think it will be the best MED for your boyfriend without a doubt.   ,1
"Amber I understand, when I was first got sick and a few times in between the road is quite bumpy, it's not a good journey and very scary. You are probably the first person that he lashes at because he loves you and you're the closest person to him.  You need to take care of yourself as well especially if you suffer with depression, sometimes you will have to distance yourself if you can for self-preservation. The best medication for me has been lithium plus Amisulipride and Duloxeteine. I think the lithium is a universal Med and available in the US. It is one of the older types of medication but it is reliable and it works well. Maybe it will be worth having a conversation with the doctor tomorrow about it.   ",1
"You can take natural stuff for the aches and to reduce the inflammation in your body. You can take ginger in a shake,or tea, sperilina, activate charcoal,bathes with Epson salt, essential oils,white willow bark, accupunture,massage ,stretching very day,hot yoga, juice fast but still take your meds on the juice fast, sanas, steamroom, meditation . There a couple that the stuff that has worked for me. I not a doctor but I reaserched alot about depression.and all that stuff has worked for me. Hope it helps",1
"For me, massage therapy works wonders on my body. Getting regular massages can really help with the pain associated with depression/anxiety. Drinking lots of water can aid in the muscles not being as tight. When the pain is bad and I can't get to a massage session, I take ibuprofen, but be careful as too much can mess your stomach up. 

Oh, and get a new doctor. This one that you have is wrong.",1
"I get intense, deep muscle aches all the time. It's not in my head either, it's the worst part of my anxiety disorder. I have over the counter wrist braces for when my fingers burn and those help. I use a lot of icy hot, and that helps for a bit as well. I reluctantly take aspirin, but it does help a bit too. Those are the only things I can do anymore myself. I hope this helps you a bit. It's not in your head an it may not even be the medication. Depression/Anxiety does take a physical toll. Or, as i had one doctor explain to me, ""All pain is biologically in your head, pain is real.""",1

"I take Welbutrine to help with the irritation.

Trazadone helps with insomnia.",1
"Interesting Michelle that you mentioned that you get that irritation feeling in your body, Bcuz I'm experiencing that! I didn't know a good way to describe it, but that's it! I'm diagnosed BiPolar (last year) and General Anxiety - I currently take 150 mg Seroquel, 40 mg Celexa, 20 mg Paxil and 1 mg Xanax at night (but I just stopped taking the Xanax a few days ago). But now I'm wide awake      Anyway, I have that same odd sensation I was going to mention to my Dr next week.",1
"Fibro and bipolar/anxiety/borderline here. Turmeric as in the spice like my dad used in pickling stuff!? I've never heard of that. Stress and temp changes (overly hot or cold) are my main triggers. Stress has been off the charts lately due to new medical issues being diagnosed, so fibro has joined the party big time.",1
"I ache all over,  it takes me about half an hour to rev my joints up.  I find sport relieves my aching painful body but it takes real self motivation to do as I doubt my ability then the anxiety and headsweats kick in but I have to do it to keep supple and I feel,at my best when I do sport.",1
"I have the same issue, my old dr moved away and the new one doesn't get why after 10 years he had me on vicodin and xanax... because nothing else worked. Trial and error of psych meds nearly killed me more than once, I can't take ibuprofen or gabapentin due to pancreatitis. But new dr is so worried about them being addictive and high risk for resale. If my old doc trusted me for so many years with never missing a follow up test and never asking for more or higher doses, why not give me what we knew works?!",1
"First. Get a new doctor. Because a doctor that's telling you that it's all in your head, is a piece of shit. Second. I take 1200mg of ibuprofen 3 times a day. I know it's a lot, but that's what it takes. When things get really bad, like from my RA, my doc will give me a single script of morphine or Vicodin. I've also found that weighted blankets are fabulous for body aches. I have one that weighs 25 pounds. And believe it or not, it helps calm anxiety attacks too.",1
"If i try to go without it , i need to do it three times as much, and trying to restrain myself drives me nuts, and i think about it all time, church didn't help it just made me feel guilty 24 /7, thank God i just masterbate alot to cope with it, to keep the cravings down , i love masterbating , i think everyone does",1
"Thank you! That's been the only way for me. I could not go 'out there' to find satisfaction, for it would weigh heavy on my conscience. I would never be able to forgive myself for *using* another for my own personal need/gain. 
   I do not judge others. To each his own, right. I just wasn't brave enough to try. 
It would've been more satisfying, no doubt. There was also the fear of being rejected. I don't think that would have happened, but the fear was always there. 
 But, for me, my butterfly is my favorite. ( the urgency can and has happened away from home)  tmi - my apologies.",1
"My sex drive has gone to litterly nothing over the last 2 yrs I am 35 I feel sorry for my husband in a way but I can't give in to his needs because than I would feel dirty, used, etc and I refuse to do that to me... yes I do hear about well back when you were a teenager or in tour early 20's you enjoyed sex or he threatens to go elsewhere and I have started to say ok go if you need I am working on ME right now and clearly you don't understand what I am going through... I have aniexty/panic attacks, sever depression, bipolar, PTSD, OCD, chronic fatigue",1
"I have almost no libido at all, and I am diagnosed with bipolar depression (bipolar II), I also have other mental illnesses as well like panic disorder and terrible anxiety. But could also be my meds. Either way I don't think that one symptom overrides all the others. Get a second opinion.",1
I agree this is something that no one talks about because you get called names. What people don't understand is that it's really a sickness and an overwhelming addiction. It ruined my first marriage.Praise Jesus he helped me through it. I've been a faithful wife for 5 years on my second marriage ❤️,1
And the guilt is excruciating,1
The guilt nearly crucified me and like you say no one to talk to. I totally empathise here have felt exactly the same. If this was a closed group I could talk more. Feel free to pm me if you want to talk. x,1
"More scary than anything, my period started and didn't stop for six months. (Pergesterone stops your period, estrogen makes you ovulate) and because testosterone is produced elsewhere I now have alot of unwanted hair across my body... Which I'm insecure about and that definitely doesn't help the libido issues. But after that all happened they tried me on lithium which made me overly suicidal so got taken off it and they don't want to try any other meds because of the issues.. so have had to do a bunch of therapy to teach me other ways to cope and try to control the swings and recognize them, etc. It's hard and definitely not easy to be with me. Just hoping we can sort out our issues and fix things before it's too late.",1
I'm so sorry. That sounds miserable :(,1
"DO NOT EVER GIVE UP YOUR MEDICATION AS THIS IS ONLY COMPLIMENTRY AS WELL AS. IT CANT GET RID OF THE CHEMICAL IMBALANCE THAT IT IS. ALWAYS TAKE MEDS WHEN ITS A VERY SERIOUS MENTAL CONDITION. IT WAS AN HORRENDOUS TIME WHEN SOME STUPID NEW DR TOLD ME TO STOP TAKING SOME TABS AND TRY OTHERS..  BUT STOPPING STRAIGHT AWAY AFTER 20 ODD YEARS OF TAKING THEM.. ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE. PANIC ATTACKS EVERY DAY:( EVENTUALLY AFTER QUITE A WHILE TBH, THEY FINALLY FOUND THE RIGHT MOOD STABILISER.. AS THEY SAID I HAD BEEN ON ANTI DEPRESSENTS THAT JUST MADE ME MANIC MORE. THEY NEVER DIAGNOSED BI POLAR TILL 11 YEAR AGO:(",1
Lamictal saved my life. Started on 25. Upped very slowly to avoid rash. Now on 300 mg. been on it 15 yrs. I'm bipolar 2. psychiatrist has had to adjust antidepressants over the years to keep depression at bay but mania is controlled perfectly and the constant roller coaster of moods is gone. I used to cycle a lot. My daughter is bipolar 2 as well and is on 200 mg Lamictal also.,1
I found it took months for lamictal to kick in and I struggled for months and still do.  If you're concerned talk to your doctor because there are other stabilizers out there.  I waited to talk to my doctor until I was on a stable dose because it keeps going up until the doctor thinks it's appropriate to stop upping the dosage,1
"I can relate to what you're going through.  I'm struggling right now too.  Just had a bad reaction to a new drug I recently started.  Yes, it gets extremely frustrating at times, but please know you're not alone.  I have struggled with most of the available mood stabilizers.  In fact, there is only one I haven't yet taken.  I don't respond well to these meds so my psychiatrist recently recommended genetic testing.  That's been a real eye opener and  finally explained why there were problems taking certain meds.  I recommend to anyone who has been unsuccessful with medications.",1
"Talk to your dr about this, there are other pills than Lamictal. Finding the right combo of pills can be horrible but you'll get there!",1
"If reaching out to me is something you feel may help,I'm here and I've shut many out on my journey and been so scared it's like I'll never walk out the door living alone trapped for many months.So I mean it when I say I'm here for you...",1
I didn't like this stuff. My anxiety was horrible. And anxiety medications didn't help much. I am off all medications now (cause I'm pregnant) and feel much much better. I hope you feel good soon ❤,1
Unfortunately getting the right dose and playing lab rat sometimes is needed to find the right meds at the right doses. It took me 18 mths to find that lithium mirtazapine and olanzapine worked for my bipolar I and anxiety. I know all to well the limbo you feel. You need to speak with your psychiatrist and tell them how you feel. Open honest communication is key. I keep a mood journal and practice cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness. There are plenty of resources on the web and mindfulness apps for your phone. Take care,1
Do you take anything extra for your anxiety?,1
Yes but I got diagnosed with anxiety along with depression and the anxiety meds made all the diff!!!!,1
"Yep.my depression makes me angry,sad,and impatient.",1
Yes all the time ... so easily overwhelmed,1
Please find a new doctor who will address your liver failure. That is scary. Do not let that go on.,1
"Don't worry dear things will take its path. I,m bipolar, my both daughters are epileptic and both are studying to be teachers. We are also going through a bad tym. Their father is unemployed and we don't HV an income. But we use each other for strength. That's wat helps us through. I,m sure u HV yr family so draw yr strength from them you will get through it. God bless sweet heart",1
"I have taken it for psychiatric purposes. It didn't agree with me, but I think I'm more of the exception than the rule. A friend of mine that has ALS takes it for her ALS. It can be used for nerve pain as well. Lyrica is the BEST for nerve pain. However Lyrica induced depression in me. I've heard so many uses for it. Although, I also have never heard it prescribed for anxiety. Don't be discouraged by my experience. I have met plenty of people that it works well for. Stay in close touch  & be totally honest with your dr. Be patient, its well worth it in the end:-)",1
"Just remember everyone is different, they gave it to my adult son for anxiety and for some nerve damage he had.  It helped, no side effects and didn't have a hard time getting off of it.  Unfortunately it is trial by fire for all drugs but it is also a process of elimination, too.  God speed.",1
Didn't work for only because maybe I've been on benzos for ten yrs .nothing is better for anxiety then benzos they ate addictive tho .,1
"I just started it two weeks ago. I also take Prozac and Geodon. I have BP 2. So far it makes me feel like I'm in a fog. I have a hard time waking up, several nights I've confused dreams with reality and vice versa. I've not been  bothered enough by the side effects to stop taking it.",1
"I take gabapentin for fibromyalgia, but my anxiety is still really horrible. I didn't even know it was prescribed for anxiety.",1
Seratonin syndrome put me in the hospital..I felt horrible and had terrible side effects.,1
"I've been an RN almost 25 years but haven't been able to work almost 2.... with all 5hose years nursing and my own psych history, I can honestly say 5his is the first I have heard of gabapentin being prescribed for anxiety. I am very familiar with it for neuropathy. I'm not knocking it because docs prescribe meds for other than their intended purpose all the time, just saying this is first I ever heard of it.... weird. I've taken some of my boyfriend's trying to ease this nerve pain I'm having that docs don't believe I have and I can say it don't do shit for my body bad nerves or my anxiety either, so.....",1
Horrible med!!! I just detoxed from it. I was only on it for a few months and the withdrawals were bad!! Not nearly as bad as all the side effects tho. I thought I had MS due to all of them. Messed me up neurologically.,1
My sister is bipolar and has horrible anxiety like myself and she is taking gabapentin and klonopin and she is down a few doses of her klonopin. I take gralise which is gaba extended release and it helps me some .,1
"If anyone else wants to try gaba. You can order it from ""Thorne Research."" I take the ""pharma GABA 250."" They make a lower dose as well. For sleep I take L-Tryptophan capsules at bedtime. I also take GABA with it. Puts me to sleep & the next morning I'm not groggy or hungover feeling.
GABA is calming. If I feel anxious. I take 1 or 2 GABA capsules. I have Xanax at my disposal. Yet, its a good idea to substitute GABA for Xanax when possible. GABA doesn't make you tired like xanax or other benzos. It decreases anxiety though:-)",1
"I was put on it in my hospital has to stop not helping with my anxiety it made my speach
Bad and very blurred vision . Now I'm in bluspalits worked very good",1
I took it for migraines. Didn't work for me. I ended up in the hospital with serotonin syndrome bc the side effects were so bad. I ended up in the hospital. I would call your doctor tomorrow and tell them what's going on. It made my depression really bad to where I was crying and had bad thoughts. My anxiety was so high I kept on having panic attacks,1
I take it for nerve damage    My anxiety is still shit tho.,1
I love my got a pad at work good for my pain and my anxiety,1
"They gave it to me for my anxiety and depression and for the nerve damage I got in a wreak. 
It helped nothing and made my anxiety and all much much worse",1
Gave me horrible migraines.,1
"I care,worry,etc...Just have no strength I guess to get up and do anything...    just don't know what to do..",1
How can I sleep though when all my anxious thoughts come rushing back at bed time TTATT,1
I don't have a problem now thanks to a week at a time day And night pill box and phone alarms. Piece of cake. The pill boxes are less than $10. Simple and effective.,1
"   always happends to me, for the most part i blame the fibro fog because of the fibromyalgia I have but it isn very risky and annoying when I can't remember if I took my antidepressants or no to   ",1
Sucks horribly going through these especially in front of my eight year old little boy it scares the crap outta him   ,1
These suck and unless you have experienced one u can't relate to the horror,1
"sitting here reading these messages with tears in my eyes,ive suffered for 17 years with it and depression and panic attacks, i feel for each and everyone of you ,i dont no wht  being normal is anymore , ive tried most things to try and help me but not 1 thing has worked so if anyone has any helpful tips on this plz tell us, ty xx",1
Mine hide pretty well. I can be freaking out unable to breathe and still function. Still keep working. I'm shaking unable to breathe eyes dilated feeling like I need to run run run I'm terrified of something I can't consciously see. But I keep working. I keep moving. I can't sit and break down. Sometimes I can separate myself and work on breathing but usually I can't. My Zoloft helps control those better so I haven't been slammed with these attacks in a while.,1
"Hi Ally. So sorry for your dilemma. It must've been hard dealing with it. I know it's not easy. Anxiety involves feelings of uneasiness, nervousness, or worry. Because we live in an uncertain world, bouts of anxiety can overtake any of us. However, please don't give up. ❤️

I'd like to share this with you that might be of help; as it already did many others. 
Please take care. ❤️

First: I know exactly what I get I don't need you trying to explain it. Second: this post specifically says anxiety attacks maybe read first before trying to look down on me.,1
Basically you get anxiety attacks. The post however describes panic attacks.,1
"Lol how can you read my comments on here?? I dont care that YOU can but can others? Im brutally honest on these sites because O feel like there is no judgment and I dont know anyone. Lol 
My attacks are causing me to question do I need mental help? Like Im terrified to be one my own... What happens when my anxiety hits am I going to be able to care for my kids properly?? My head is a mess. My thoughts come and go so quickly and mix with each other Im like unable to function. Some days I feel like Im rocking the world and then other days I feel Im letting the world down and am a huge failure to everything I have tried in my life. I love my kids but I question my strength. Im tired of feeling this way. i want to wake with energy and filled with life. I dont know how.. I have people telling me how and it sounds great and something I am interested in but am I strong enough. Lately I dont have the strength to run to the mailbox...  ",1
"The past few weeks have been horrible for me. Im getting paralyzing panic attacks. They are horrivle and almost always hit me as soon as my eyes open.  Before I can even think of anything my heart is racing, insides turning to liquid and quickly escaping my body, uncontrollable shaking.   I feel my heart racing like Im running for my life and I start to tyr and control my breathing.  I feel so broken. Im a mom of 2 who is pretty much single so when these happen I feel like Im not even good enough to be a mom. I am doing therapy but im not sure what else can help... Or how much longer I can mentally handeling having these.",1
I feel like that myself for weeks and today I was shaking and crying...it's a horrible feeling and my anxiety level is over the roof..don't feel like doing anything...so I know exactly how you feel.......,1
Now that's a REAL anxiety attack! I have had to pull over on the side of road or in a parking lot to call my mother because she knows exactly what to say to me to calm me down.,1
It takes time... I have been on it for 10 months and mood swings have settled down. Just make sure you dont hav the shakes or any other sise effect too. It took a couple of adjustments to my dose to reach where I am now,1
This has been the hardest for me.  I used to be a fairly outgoing social person... now making a phone call to my daughter's school leads to a panic attack and rage..  it is so tiring..,1
"Wow!!!  I never knew. In school I would literally try to make myself as small as possible so as to not be touched publicly. I have always hated shopping alone or paying for stuff alone I get all red faced and embarrassed. I really hate eating alone as I feel extremely fat not just a little bit but like I am suddenly triple my size. I can't even go Christmas shopping without dragging a friend along to keep my nerves calm. Heck, 1 time even with them I wound up sitting on the floor crying for no reason and all they did was sit on the floor next to me and talk me through it. Then we were able to continue.",1
90% of the above.  It's horrible.,1
I'm a bipolar doctor. Never met a borderline I didn't like and admire . My last partner of 2 years was borderline. Volatile and explosive at times . A strong intelligent independent and humorous woman  despite some difficulty I gained much from our relationship and we remain good friends.  Be proud of who you are embrace your different ways of operating. No shame. You have endured much and tour and best is in front of you persistence and look to take the chance to be kind whenever the opportunity arises. John x,1
Lol... I had to laugh but it's so not funny living like that on a regular!! So dysfunctional and irritating!! Especially when you've been you doctor's medication guinea pig for several years and still no progress!! Then they wonder why the only time I leave the house is to when I have to do something for my kids...,1
Future problem.. Worry about the now sweet lady!!  ,1
"I don't doubt your grandfather's wise words, it's a matter of my anxiety making it difficult to believe that.",1
A piece of advice I was given by my grandfather that ALWAYS held true was 99% of what you worry about NEVER happens. If you can just try to go by that your thoughts should start to settle down.,1
"Thank you, sometimes it's my way of closure, but sometimes it can be my down fall. My major problem is that it keeps on working all the time, so many thoughts and no breaks  within my mind. I'm always thinking, my mind is never silent. And it's always about things that most in the world don't think about nor worry about. Thus making me feel like I am slowly going insane... I feel like I am stuck in a world of people that are unaware of the hidden dangers. Amongst the many I so rarely find people that think the same as me, and view things truly open minded. I am self aware of my own faults as well as others'. It's a blessing and a curse all together...",1
"I can really understand and feel the way. It's a daily struggle! You just wrote everything I go thru n feel! I have anxiety ptsd BPO 
I self harm alot more then ever now
Cuz all I hear is how I'm not good enough and I can't do anything right!",1
"It could, but the horror of it all is that you carry this darkness around all the time and there are many moments when all of that stuff doesn't matter to you anymore. I understand everyone has some type of problem in life. But, I would honestly rather be homeless and starving than deal with the shit that goes on inside my mind 24/7...",1
"Another small gem given me by a beloved friend, that my attitude is more important than the facts and it's not about what happens to us, it's what we do with what happens to us which will determine whether we go up or down. And something l've struggled with for awhile up to last Friday, our negative thoughts create our own reality. And the best little cliche lol, our attitude determines our altitude! 
Find something to laugh about, read some funny jokes online, watch a funny movie, take a walk on the beach, see all the beauty surrounding us, rejoice! And you shall rejoice again one day, you shall again know happiness and peace. Each one of us holds the seeds to our own unhappiness within us. But we also hold our happiness there. We are left to make the choice. And remember that our happiness doesn't lie in our partner or in things... Let's CHOOSE to be happy. Bless you <3",1
"Oh wow I know all about these feelings as described above, each and every one of them. They used to hound me every minute of every day until I lived in this awful vacuum that was slowly sucking me in and sucking my life out, suicide seemed the only way to escape the pain, the frustration, the black clouds surrounding me. The black pit that was my life threatened to drown me in its slime. My daughter had by now completely rejected me but I can understand why. 
There was so much hurt from emotional abuse l'd suffered from the men in my life  (l was unable to be all l should have been in my marriages because of the awful love/hate l felt for my verbally abusive dad)
Diagnosed BP II in 2008 after a severe head injury and full left Hemiplegia, motorcycle accident '75, l struggled to keep going but the anger and rage poured out on my elderly late husband every night  ( dangerously stressful job with severe discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment for ten years )
I was severely suicidal and told my very wise and wonderful sister of all my problems. I was shocked, stunned. I've never seen her like that, she told me that she'd wanted to tell me for a long time...
She said ""Stop feeling sorry for yourself!! You're healthy physically, you have eyes, ears and all four limbs. Stop being a martyr, stop all the me me me me me and get a life!!! Think about all you have, start being grateful. 
She loves Joyce Meyer and loves her popular phrase ""stinkin'thinkin'.  Get RID of it!! Find something you're passionate about and DO it, whatever it is. Help others less fortunate than yourself, climb out of yourself, start being kind to yourself, start loving yourself, spoil yourself, STAY on your meds. Change your life... Only you can. 
Well thanks very much Missy, l'm older than you, how dare you speak to me like that???  But you want to know something,?  Today l live a wonderful positive peaceful and happy life. Whenever negative thoughts try to creep in l say out loud, move back on out, l won't allow you to destroy me again. Speak to God, He is right there to help you and He will. We screwed up in Paradise and that is why we have illnesses to try us but through the Lord we can and will overcome. May God bless you in your new mindset. Love Felicity",1
"Sounds like its time to say WHEN. I was desperate for my marriage to work. In the process, I now see I stayed too long. Don't waste anymore of your precious time on your husband. If a person can't meet you half way. Then find someone that will.
I'm so much happier all alone than I ever was when I was married. Some people aren't marriage material. Know that you can't change that.",1
"I know for my fiance and I we struggle with communication so there's always a point where we sit on our bed and just have a talk I let him go first and he can vent and talk about how he is handling things what he's stressed about, etc then I will chime in don't blame him for the way he is feeling or anything like that just focus on trying to understand each others thoughts and feelings. I am so sorry that you are experiencing this I really hope I was able to help at all.",1
"I'm type 2 also, and with high anxiety. Be patient and kind to yourself. It might take a while to get the meds that'll work for you, but you WILL.",1
"The meds antidepressants make me paranoid. Remeron, lexapro.",1
Have you changed meds? Some of the side affects are dry mouth and that caused some dental problems for me. Have a dental appt tomorrow and I'm anxious about it.,1
Such simple words - doubt they'll ever help me   ,1
Agree and I think that is why some of us worry so.  Some things are simply out of our human control!,1
"Most of 'what not to say' has been said to me by my family who  from the word go had decided that they weren't going to acknowledge my ptsd,severe dep,anxiety issues..It is during this time that i needed them the most , that they decided not to be there for me..A couple of years on now and they still don't support me what so ever..Never even ask me simple things like - Do you eat regular.Do you manage to sleep,Do you manage to get any support-just nothing...Well what i learnt was family isn't always loyal..",1
"No your not you can talk to me anytime you need, yes I have anxiety, depression, OCD, PTSD, panic attacks, and I have all kinds of medical issues that go with that oh and let's not forget my favorite I'd love to beat myself up you know I don't need anyone to say what I should or shouldn't do I do a good job of that myself but really if you ever need someone I will be the most least judgemental person you will ever meet my name is Amy and you can reach me through my Facebook page or just by instant messaging me",1
A lot of people have no idea what it's like to have severe depression. They are very fortunate but because they once had a bit of a low period they think they've had depression and judge it on their experience. They have no idea how debilitating it is. You just get looked at like you're talking a load of crap and exaggerating. It's the same with anxiety. It's pure torture and they don't believe you because they once had a bit of anxiety and it wasn't as bad as you're making out. Would love to see how these people would cope with severe anxiety and  depression. They'd never judge us again.,1
What if you're too afraid to be in public?,1
"You could try to meditate go on youtube and put in guided meditation for bipolar or for anger, insomnia, anxiety, stress any of these things.  I used to walk away and go and meditate.  Initially up to 8 times a day.  Make sure its guided though and not just the music, the breathing is important.  My personal faves are Jason Stephenson and The Honest Guys. Good luck so hard without meds.  Change Doc as soon as you can once your finances are sorted but do not let him win by having self doubt, keep your studies up.",1
"I hate the term(just shy),and a lot of people with mental illness have drug problems from self medicating years before they seek help.I don't like this doctor.I hope he doesn't discourage you from future help.good for you for trying.god bless",1
I struggle with bipolar everyday I was diagnosed when I was 9 it's hard at times especially when you're in a despesive state I've learned my own coping methods like if I want to say something rude I think of my favorite song or I take a deep breaths. I've also noticed if I have something in my hand all the time like a stone or anything small I will rub it constintally and it helps a lot to keep me calm and focused,1
"My 34 year old son has come up with his own techniques.  When he is angry he holds up his hand like stop and that is our cue not to talk to him, when he returns to us and starts talking then we know it's safe to talk to him again.  When he gets anxious he rides stationary bike, paces a lot, does other yard work, etc.  He used to write a journal which I do think is a great idea.  Hope you can get to another dr. quickly.  If you are in the US you might try calling MHMR, here in Texas or at least where we are they will treat you for free.",1
Mindfulness is a godsend for me to help dealing with my anxiety and anger. There are plenty of resources on the net explaining what it is and what to do. There are even apps for your phone. Don't get too caught up on a diagnosis. Keep a mood journal so when you can see another dr you can show them to help diagnosis. Take care.,1
"I know the gym has been mentioned. I gone to the gym for 19 years. It the best angry release.  Start off slow. If you can't join a gym you,Can always take long walks. You can adjust your diet too. It makes a big difference. Try meditating it will be hard a first but your mind will get used to it.put on some relaxing music it well calm the mind. Take baths  cover your head with a beany , they say that some mental illness are due to some abnormal swelling in the head. Go in side a sana or steam room. Try taking coconut oil, ginger , sperilina, omega to help with the swelling of the head. If you can get accupunture,or massage to reduce the tension  . Yoga , steraching, journaling has help me track my triggers. I just send my self text message to track my triggers and talk about it with a therapist. Aroma therapy. Essential​ oils to calm the mind",1
"I've had the same issue and all my life - I'm highly sensitive and my family life was a chaotic mess as my parents were narcissists and bipolar. I went through hell. I've learned a few things to share. 1) eat healthy food at regular times per day. 2) avoid sugary and fatty foods as they fuel problems. 3) write letters daily to yourself. Write out your pain, fear and anger. Put them in a safe place. Also write your goals, dreams and things you're grateful for. 4) listen to happy or classical music - proven to change brain chemistry. 5)  read about anger - it's a message that something is wrong. Change what you can and accept what you cannot. 6) be really compassionate to yourself, no judging.  7) learn meditation - online is fine. Hope these help!",1
"Hi there. I'm sharing you two beautiful links that's beneficial. 

(1) To control your ANGER, must start with in you. Sometimes you might become angry because you see only one aspect of the issue—the part that affects you. Try to consider the other side of the story. There's usually an explanation that can help us show a little understanding.” Do you have access to the Bible? Please read this Bible principle in Proverbs 19:11. The wisdom in it might help you. ❤️

Here is the Bible-based article related to your anger-problem situation.

"Just shy I use to hate people saying that to me..I don't take medication, this is my own choice. My life is strict, its very scheduled and and I have a psychologist, I have regular sleep hours, very important but what has helped me massively is my gym workouts, I work out alot. Could you see a psychologist ?",1
I am on it too and works how and again but have anxiety attack today couldn't even go out...,1
"How long have you been on it? Is it possible that you need a medication adjustment?  I found I was worse on the higher doses sertraline than the lower ones. At 50 I was ok but anxiety wasn't controlled, was upped to 100 and had multiple panic attacks a day, generally unwell.

Hang in there.  Medication can be frustrating.  I've been messing with mine for a year and finally have an apt with a new dr for evaluation.",1
"I find anxiety to be debilitating, controlling & terrorizing all at the same time. ☹️☹️",1
"It usually ""blows""through high blood pressure or bleeding ulcers, better to to find ""relaxation response"" or a  ""funny movie"" .",1
"Take your husband  to your Doctor when you next go, If he`s a decent Doctor he should make him perfectly aware of how serious an illness this is, that is NOTHING to be ashamed.",1
Thats shameful of yr hubby to speak to you this way. Love to you   ,1
"My ex husband is a narcissist..when I confront him of every day issues like getting health insurance for our baby, when I found out I was highly pregnant, He said we would pay cash when and if needed to.    ..I then realized he did not want children... I spent 2010 working with him to make our future, 2013 married him,2014 gave birth, 2015 divorce.. Due to my ex being a narcissist... I'm recovering from depression/anxiety due to me giving up my life for my ex husband who is all about himself... He has nothing to do with our child unless its court ordered.... It may be Him..and not you...",1
That's a crock! Shame on him! He is NOT helping you.,1
"I suffer from depression also.I have anxiety pills with me all the time,we I take them whenever I need them. Apparently your husband doesn't understand how it works and his words were harsh. Even though we know your not a junkie,i would have said to him""yea I'm a junkie,so what"". And turn around and leave the room. Don't let it get to you! Don't let it keep going around and around in your brain. Take some deep breaths.Let it go! And pray to God for answers.",1
"I lost my job due to my mental health, so my husband walked out, he said I was a lazy sponger, he doesn't understand what it is to feel so hopeless, but I suppose I only have myself to worry about now.",1
"Probably sounds really dumb of me but......are there classes where the family member's can go and learn about it? So they can educate themselves a bit. Personally if I was the family member and had a mentally ill loved one. I'd go to book stores, libraries, the internet and educate myself on my loved ones mental illness, study and write things down. When you truly love someone you'd do anything to help them feel at ease, you would love them, support them, listen to them. And they will love you back. Love both ways. If someone loves you they wouldn't act this way. I'm so frustrated about them not wanting to educate themselves or find a book or something. So so many don't bother. That's not love. I have full blown panic/anxiety attacks and take my meds to calm me down. I guess I'm a ""junkie"" too. A junkie is someone who is addicted or dependent on drugs or meds and can't stop. Sorry this has happened darling",1
"He needs to realize the difference between maintaining mental illness with meds and a junkie.  Someone that is mentally ill wants to get better so they can maintain a quality of life and be as ""normal"" as possible and medication can help them do that while a junkie takes pills and meds to help them avoid dealing with life. You sought help and ate getting more help that doesn't happen for someone that is faking it..... I'm wondering if you talk to your doctor about maybe explaining things to him. He needs to realize that you need his understanding and support and negativity won't help you.",1
hi i was put on zoloft 300mgs i feel they dont work that much but everyone is different & i do have alot of stress in my life atm which doesnt help,1
Depends on your diagnosis. I'm diagnosed bipolar 2 and mixed features Zoloft made me very irritable and brought out the rage of my bipolar. My psychiatrist said Zoloft for bipolar is a bad idea because it'll flip you into a manic episode (which it did),1
You mentioned bad thoughts. Many people with bipolar disorder  have psychosis at one time or another during their life. They put you on an anti-psychotic medication  (usually temporarily). Even though it feels embarrassing  taking an anti-psychotic medication. It takes away the bad thoughts & made me act normal again. I realized the bad thoughts weren't caused from my depression. Although it did make my depression worse. The underlying cause was psychosis. Its hard for bipolar people to keep regular sleep schedules. Lack of sleep can bring on psychosis.,1
I've take ablify along with zoloft. I've bern on Zoloft about 18 mths and had no probe.  Previous to that I was on effexor and before that many others. Started ablify due to paranoia compulsive self harming thoughts/ behaviour.,1
my 13 y o is on that combo and it works for her bp and anxiety - she's been on it for many years - she was also a Zoloft baby - as I took Zoloft throughout my pregnancy bc back then they deemed it safe - same with my son - he was a Zoloft baby too and he has been on Zoloft now for his depression anxiety for almost a year :(,1
If ur bipolar....not a good med imo. My daughter was recently prescribed it and she went into psychosis..it was awful. At just 25mgs....she had horrible withdrawals from zoloft too. Which surprised me because she was only on it for 2 weeks at the lowest  dose.,1
"I worked in mental health care for 10 years and was very good at my job, but between mental illness, job stress, and events in my life I was rendered a mess that can barely take care of himself yet alone others.  I'm disabled now.  All I can advise is to get a support network of friends and family and get meds and therapy and try to work through this.  I haven't lost hope that I will get back to where I used to be.",1
"it's not your fault and you aren't ""stupid."" it is not your fault. i work in an incredibly busy pharmacy and i know it doesnt come close to the stress of nursing but i managed to force them into scheduling me only part time and at night. it's okay to work with anxiety and bipolar, i have bipolar 1 and ptsd and anxiety disorder. they say that working with these chronic conditions is how we can get through them, they're never going to go away and that isnt our fault. granted i dont do anything, at all anything, on my days off. i just said alot of words but the real thing i want to say is it is not your fault. [heart]",1
"Anxiety is a monster. Not sure what you do about it, as I never found the answer, and no one ever seemed interested in treating that aspect of my illness; they only wanted to focus on, and treat, the depression. I wish you the best.",1
"i feel that way alot but im sure my job is half as demanding as being a nurse. People dont understand what it takes to get out of bed, get in the car , get even to the edge of the driveway.  The stress and anxiety, the constant thinking going on in our heads, Negativity and shaming constantly.  I understand everything you think , everything you feel. You are not alone. I wish I could stand up and say i cannot work. If they only knew how i feel every day. Great Job standing up for yourself . You are awesome",1
Yes and like you I feel so stupid for allowing myself to get in such a state of panic and dread around situations that other people find easy. I've lost jobs and interviews due to this in past and even socially I find it hard. There are many techniques but it isn't easy to just suddenly become confident smiley individual. Take small steps.,1
Sounds like anxiety.,1
"Such a fear of medication screw ups... Ha can't even think of the right name for it... Smh... Bottom line is, I couldn't live with hurting or worse, killing someone!",1
"Yes... I was a janitor at my kids' school. It slowly changed into a para too. Then one of elementary schools closed and became a special education building.  They wanted me to stay and have a couple of ""goffers"" to teach daily living skills. Ok, no prob...
The starting of it was ok... until it morphed into 3-4 classrooms of 30-40 spec ed high schoolers! The panic set in, I don't have the skills or training for this.... other than my own two! 
The sit down plan did it! Come to find out one of the young men that was a ""goffer"" had a heart condition too and should have NEVER been doing some of the things we were doing!!(IEP wasn't shown to me until, the sit down) And his daily para WAS there pushing!!!! That was it i was done! No way I could have lived w/myself had something happened to him! 
I walked away from the school systems.... miss the kids, but not the stress or worry! 
I have not worked in several yrs.",1
"Yes.  It happened to me.  I always worked full time.  Two jobs.  Single mom of the year.  And then like a strike of lightening......it was like the flood gates opened and my whole life fell into my lap at once.  I have bipolar 1. Ptsd. Anxiety.  And borderline personality disorder.  I started medicines that seemed to help. Then I lost my jobs because of my irrational behavior and tardiness. That was last June.  I literally went from being Wonder Woman to a shell of Wonder Woman.  I still want all those things.... Job,  money,  social life,  friends and family...... But I'm crippled with irrational fears and anxieties. I stay home with my kids now.  I try to stay busy so I don't feel so worthless.  I craft. I force myself to make 1 phone call a day so that I'm not completely alone.  I try to make the best what's right here in my comfort zone.",1
"I cry over anything and everything.  I think sometimes that I am way too emotional, but then people who don't show any emotion kind of scare me!",1
"Interesting point. Before I got treated I would list all the things weighing on or annoying me. What I learned was that it was hormonal and brain chemistry caused. I don't discuss my chronic anxiety  or depression with most people, I have a therapist to help me with that. I do discuss my pain and exhaustion due to fibro because that disables me more visibly.",1
"If you're struggling and your people are just sitting there watching you struggle, they're not your people.
So Be It",1
"Caregivers must be well in order to properly look after their loved ones. Seek the treatment you need and, though it may be hard, cast aside any guilt for seeking treatment because there should be none. You don't need your family's consent or their approval to seek treatment. Forcing yourself to suck it up may make things worse in the long run. Can't offer people something to drink if your pitcher is empty . Do what you have to do for yourself, for your well-being, and for your future.",1
"pray ask God come into your  life, its satan thats doing ths to u hes giving u a horrible life, God will heal what satan scumbags damaged do it now you will have peace love contentment keepin u in prayer xox",1
Go back to the hospital. Seems like everyone is focused on their well being you should do the same. It's not being selfish or anything of that nature but how do they expect you to tend to your mom if you're unstable how do you think that you're able to so? My family puts pressure on me knowing I'm not doing very well almost like they tend to forget at times I honestly feel they don't care about anything but what they need or want and then I end up relapsing. I have learned how to distance myself from those type people to prevent having any setbacks. Every situation is different but if you're feeling that bad I pray you find it in you to go seek help immediately!!! God bless you and I hope all turns out well!,1
"Exactly, I fear not being on meds. It took many many years to find the right ones, but now I know how good I can be with the help of my meds and counseling. I never ever want to go back to depression.",1
"I take Zoloft, i was told by my doctor not to stop even though i have horrible migraines, i feel tired sleepy. I dont see the energy she said I'd have i dont like this medication and i do want to stop taking it.",1
"I have depression, and anxiety. But okay? I choose to deal with mine naturally, medication isn't a solution for everyone was my point. And some things are better managed  by vitamins exercise and Whole Foods.",1
"I was really bad about not taking my meds after I start feeling better and every single time , weeks or months later, I crash and burn. For the past 3 months I have been taking me meds everyday like prescribed and I haven't crashed and I feel ""normal"" , what I think everyone else feels like. I knew better than to stop taking them, I knew what would happen I don't know why I would do it.  There are side effects of the meds but I would rather deal with side effects than live without the medication and depression, anxiety and mood swings.",1
"LISTEN, EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT HOW THEY ARE WITH THINGS. WITH BI-POLAR FOR GENUINE, THEN YOU MUST TAKE MEDICATION TO STOP THIS HORRID HORRID FEELINGS AND PANIC ATTACKS YOU GET IF YOU DO NOT TAKE THEM. IVE HAD THE LOT. NIGHTMARES EVERY NIGHT AND DISORIENTATION WHEN I NEVER HAD MEDS. DEEP DEPRESSION, HORRENDOUS ANXIETY, BUT WHEN I FOUND THE RIGHT MEDS, I WAS FEELING GREAT. SO DONT START THROWING THESE MEDS AWAY. ITS DANGEROUS. IF YOU FEEL OK WITHOUT MEDS, WELL YOU HAVENT GOT GENUINE BI-POLAR OR ANY GENUINE MENTAL ILLNESS. I FOLLOWED WHAT MY PSYCHIATRIST SAID, AND NEVER LOOKED BACK.",1
I take all my meds as prescribed sure they don't cure me. However they do stablize my moods. I am productive almost every day. I still have days where I don't want to get out of bed. Other days I talk to fast or get irritable. For the most part my days are good.  I don't think my meds are a miracle cure. They juts enhance my ability to enjoy life.,1
"Medication doesn't feel fine, medication makes you want to go get a rope and go out the back yard... its better to live with your insanity and not want to breathe & living with your demons is the lesser evil even though both are misery lol ....",1
Had to breath slow and steady all day. Anxiety all day,1
and ofcourse islam. islam has a bad influence. all those terror attacks are credited to muslims with a mental disorder.,1
Anxiety and depression  is a killer,1
"oh my gosh, that is scary. wish I could start sleeping regularly.",1
"I feel the same way about my anxiety. Sometimes, I can't explain why I'm feeling anxious because I don't know why.",1
In my  dreams I can't ever read the chalk board writing. Its like its shorthand. It makes me soooo depressed and I fall into a deeper depression. I wake up crying and shaking and i pick up something and read and feel better.,1
"I sorry you have been suffering. You probably have bipolar 3 where you don't see thing . You have extremely high where your funtional. Then you have a drop a low of a period of depression. It goes up and then it goes down. You need to be on a ant- depressant for a period of time enough time for it to work . We as a society take ton of meds but when it comes to mental illness we refuse to take anything bc your afraid it will make you look weak. Or be judged. The all person by that is judging is our self bc that what are mental illness does to us your fine . You will feel better soon our brain tricks us constantly.i had clinical depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar 3, obsessive  complsive  desorder .  For years I lied to my self and refused the help because I had my highs. But we I got therapy, meds and tried everything to read up on the illness I began to be consistent . I get accupunture, and , massage,therapy, emdr,meds,I workout,take vitamin,jucice, coffee enamas, sauna,bath . With mental illness there is abnormal inflammation in the Brian ,so I take omega, coconut oil,ginger,white willow bark, I cover my head while I take a bath to warm up my head like with a beany. I meditate, I tell people I have a mental illness and the don't believe it bc I so funtional. Don't be scared of it just try to find stuff that helps u. I make art and pottery for me creating things is an outlet. Maybe try a new hobby. I not a doctor but I hope my suggestion helped.",1
"I'm embarrassed to admit this. On Mother's day I fell asleep  (don't even recall lying down). I didn't wake up till 8:45 pm. We were supposed to have dinner etc. I missed all of it, Nor did I call until I woke at 8:45. The worst part is that I'm 40 years old. I absolutely felt like crap. Possibly ask your mom if she could teach your daughter to do these things. I was raised by a single mom as well. It never occurred to my brothers to get my mom a card & gift. Once I took them out shopping for her. They got the hang of it. I do feel for you though.  It must really hurt to not even get a 99 cent card on mother's day:-(",1
"The MOST awful feeling is being estranged from your children.... and when you're bpd/ptsd/anxiety/ocd/adhd etc that feeling without your family is magnified by 100x. It's the worst feeling in the world. You're not selfish you just FEEL more than others.... Take your daughter to dinner- tell her Happy Mother's Day- without you; she wouldnt be here. Tell her you love her and just enjoy the moment- doesn't matter what day it is you're still M❤M. Remember: just as you suffer from these debilitating titles so do our children- they are hurt by our hurt and relationships are affected by the slightest. Be patient and selfLESS... time is on your side.   
Happy Mother's Day!",1
"No, I felt the same way yesterday. No acknowledgement, no gift, nothing. It was a horrible day.",1
"I almost forgot it was mother's day personally. I have no relationship with my own mother and my youngest son is entering his last week of his freshman year of high school, my horse gashed his forehead open, my A&P class started, I had served on a major criminal case jury the week before last, my oldest totally took over everything for me while I was stuck at a courtroom for 12+ hours a day. So we all forgot until my dad reminded me Saturday. Mother's day isn't a big deal to me, my kids appreciate me every day of the year, they have been known to give me father's day cards too in the past because I am a single mom and play both rolls. I don't hold one thoughtless moment against them much, they are teenagers, teenagers are notoriously selfish (it's just how their brains are), doesn't mean she doesn't love you or appreciate you. Yes your mom could have done something, but she didn't and why get upset about what could of would of should of? It's really not worth the energy. My ex never did crap for me on my birthday, mother's day, any holidays, and I spent a lot of time being miserable, and letting him ruin it. We run into problems when we expect people to treat us the same way we treat them, rather than accepting that people do the best that they can do, even when it's far from acceptable to us. I've worked hard to learn how to not rely on others for my happiness",1
"I am astonished by this conversation. I have no children by birth but 3 grown adults for whom I have been a special ""mom"". I am acknowledged weekly with love and appreciation for the contributions and nurturing I've given through the past 10+ years. I do not selfishly look for this. It comes as a result of building and sustaining a strong relationship. I have no ""anxiety"" over the issue whatsoever and personally feel you have blown this way out of perspective and are creating your own malcontent experience.",1
"It's far from selfish hun. Its just the way you're feeling at the moment and something so small, that possibly wouldn't bother you, has become more prominent and it's upsetting. Maybe have a little word with your mum as to how it's made you feel, I'm sure she didn't want to make you feel this way. Its good to talk hun xx",1
"On my very first Mother's Day, after years of infertility, my husband never even got me a card. My son is a teenager now, and it still hurts. I didn't suffer from anxiety or depression back then, so I don't think you're being selfish at all. It's still hit or miss some years with hubby...last year nothing, this year cards, gifts, and dinner. It's not about the gifts, it's about feeling loved and appreciated. We all want to feel that regardless of our mental health.",1
I dont think your being selfish ! Maybe anxiety & over thinking too much about it . I'm not saying that in a nasty way to you . My kids are in their 20s & forgot Mother's Day too. But I've never encouraged Mother's Day / Father's Day etc just another day for me . Xx,1
Its true. And I lost that when my Mumma passed away. Been a year and a half of struggling alone with no support and it sux.,1
I'm sorry. It's the things that bother us even though we feel like they shouldn't.   Keeping a very detailed journal for your therapist will help more than anything.  It's so hard to say what you want to in the short time you get.   It is a difficult challenge to do. And when it happens the distress makes it hard to write or remember. Keep something on you at all times to document.   I wish you the best,1
"I felt the same way up until last year. My dad took me to a Krav Maga class and I learned how to defend myself. The first time I had to hit the other woman's padded bag, I broke down in tears. The instructor came over and encouraged me to hit and keep hitting. I was sobbing the whole time, but it really helped. Now I know where to hit an attacker, what will bring him/her down quickly. It was so empowering that I'm now able to leave the house. I still get some anxiety when coming home late from work, but I remember what they taught me. Muscle memory and to immediately react if attacked.",1
"I do this. It's like I have a bubble around me that shrinks. What you need is a distraction. The fear isn't really your environment, it's in your head.",1
I moved to Portugal and for the first year I was too scared to go out alone as I didn't speak Portuguese. Now I can so feel much better. I'm so sorry you're having this problem but I can relate. For years I was afraid of the night because that's when our grandfather would get drunk and chaos reigned. I was also afraid of teenaged boys for years due to harassment. You're doing the right thing by talking about your fear. I hope you will be able to share with your Dr. Hugs,1
"Taking what you've posted on this thread already, should give your dr. Or therapist enough information to be able to begin a treatment plan to help you overcome your fears of being alone.  Do you think you could possibly have a deep seated fear of abandonment?  That was a disorder I had to deal with because of issues that stemmed from my childhood when my parents divorced.  No matter which one of them was taking care of me...the other one was absent in my life....this was what set me up to feel abandoned when I was left alone in my adult life.  With the right treatment plan, medication & learning how to cope I was able to overcome those desperate feelings of abandonment.",1
As others have suggested if you feel uncomfortable verbalising things then write it down infact what you have posted is exactly what you should show your Dr. So that they can make a proper diagnosis or refer to specialist etc.,1
"Idk but try searching about paranoid personality disorder. And maybe when you know more about it, you can comfortably discuss it to your doctor or therapist.",1
"I suggest you write down everything that's going on, everything that scares you. How you feel, better, copy paste what you just posted and hand it to your doctor. He has to know so that he can help you with the right medication. It works for me. I have problems talking and I can't talk on the phone neither. Let your feelings flow on the paper.
It will work. Take care.",1
"If the doctor and therapist don't know they can't help.  Please let them know.  My son can be alone but can't sleep in his room upstairs, he is 34, he sleeps on the couch to be nearer to us.  But we can go overnight about twice a year and he says he isn't scared, has 2 dogs that is what helps him.",1
"I did this too, writing everything I was experiencing, when I went to a psychiatrist the first time. I hate meds but I have a lot of things wrong. There are some that are out there and it would ease the anxiety. I think after that your behavioral therapy would be easier. That is my opinion. Like everyone seems to be saying, you need to open up to your psychiatrist or you're not going to get the right help. You've suffered enough! Tell him everything and how it makes you feel. Thoughts and prayers",1
You probably have severe anxiety. And anxiety can come form anything high stress . Or some childhood trama. If therapy is going to work you need to be honest with your therapist in order for them to help you. You need to be able to Except there is a problem  in order for you to address it and get some coping strategies. Also there lot of defrient anxiety med . Tracking trigger will make you feel more in control. Tell your family even as silly as you think it is. They will support you and cope better. Try exercising an order to burn off extra energy from your body. Be kind with your self one step at a time,1
"Use this religiously it can be bought at Wal-Mart, CVS, Walgreens. This little bottle is about 6 bucks ... I bit mine at Walgreens because it's bigger, I use it every time I shower where my hair grows (I can shave now) and *embarrassing * under my fat roll.... NO MORE SORES",1

"Yes I am going through this. I have gained 100 pounds in just a few months from medications that make me hungry, and depression because the pills aren't helping me so I don't care what I eat. I'm trying to get control and trying different meds. That's one reason mental health problems suck. So many drugs they put you on. Then there are new side effects and it's just a never ending circle. I've also developed poly neuropathy. I'm sad I let my body go but depression makes you not care. You will eventually find something that has less side effects. Don't be upset about your weight. It will come off. Please stay
Positive about yourself   ",1
"I gained quite a bit of weight on lamictal, so I'm pretty sure it's a common problem and yes my face broke out like I was back in puberty. Struggled for a long time with both, but finally found a cleanser that worked for my face. It's called cetaphil but I don't know if it's available in your country.

"I just love when people say you have to be strong.....um let me see you live with this illness, work, raise kids alone, deal with everyday life struggles, cry your eyes out almost on a daily, endure tremendous emotional pain that gets so bad it becomes physical....and still smile. Never tell a survivor of mental illness they need to be strong....only the strong can keep going and never give up no matter how much they've gone through. People live their lives trying to avoid feeling uncomfortable, or only understand grieving when they lose a loved one or get divorced, or any life tragedy. People with mental illness get to know what that pain feels like already...and we still are trying to survive. Warriors is what we are...and to be a warrior and survive this illness takes more strength than most can even wrap their mind around.",1

4-7-8 breathing technique. Shown to reduce anxiety by 65%.   ,1
"I use mindfulness. It has been a godsend. There are plenty of resources on the internet explaining what it is and what to
Do and there are even apps for your phone. A simple eg is colouring. It helps you focus on one thing so you change your mindset. Like I said it's a simple example. It's something you need to practice everyday so you are ready when your anxiety starts to take hold. Take care.",1
If you have a generalized anxiety disorder it might not be possible to come up with a reason for the anxiety or anxiety attack- I usually lose my hearing and most of my sight in a panic attack and I find the take an ice cube in each hand and squeeze method to be very effective.  My psychologist told me about it - just hold an ice cube in each hand tightly and it really helps I think it cools you while slowing something down and distracts your mind with the sensation.  Once I start to come back down to earth I start repeating to myself you are here you are safe and push your feet into the floor and feel the sensation.  Look around and notice things to remind you that you are safe in a safe place ...I use these they are simple and they work for helping me gain back my faculties especially.,1
"I just learned this... in order to identify your anxiety, you have to know what feeling your having, and then figure out what feeling made you have that one. Example: had a great day, found out both my teens had plans today, I immediately went from happy to sad to angry to self destruct mode. And in reality I was just truly hurt. I'm told it's a learned behavior. Which still I don't know from where, I can see why. I believe it comes from a mix of being abused, and people being mean, and eventually being taken advantage of. It's very frustrating I know. And it just plane sux!!!! But if your able to do that it will help. Took me about 5 hours to see that and a lot of talking and distracting myself. Will I remember for next time? I hope so.. hope this helps somewhat!! Best of luck!!",1
"Deep breathing is the absolute best way to handle anxiety. Take a deep breath in through your mouth, hold for 5 seconds, then release slowly as if you are blowing through a straw. Repeat multiple times. You should also look up progressive muscle relaxation, it's a very useful tool where you tighten parts of your body and release. Sounds weird but is very credible and works.",1
"I have shared this words so many times. I'll share it again... If an incurable disease has invaded your life, refuse to let it touch your spirit. Your body can be severely afflicted, and you have a great struggle. But if you keep trusting God's love, your spirit will remain strong.",1
Omg! The struggle is real.,1

"Many people (including me) suffer from this and it's apparently part of anxiety. I googled for it and a lot of links came up.  I personally looked at them as biochemical errors and did not worry about them. However, I did seek and continue treatment for anxiety which made my life so much more pleasant. Others cannot see your thoughts but I think you are suffering greatly from this problem and it's totally desirable and worth seeking professional help. You are not strange, you're perfectly human!",1
Hello no i get more anxiety on this medication.,1
Hehe..charlie brown actually calms my anxiety..iguess he worries for me.,1
if I don't have something to worry about my mind will definitely find something more to obsess about and then some.,1
"There is light at the end of the tunnel, its a struggle but worth it.  Ask your doctor to change your meds.  I am on venlafaxine and stresam and all I can do is praise this wonderful combination.  Also meditation and cognitive behavioural therapy worked for me too.  Perhaps try exercising too I took up golf.  A great tiring walk with a purpose.  Good luck remember you have people who love you.",1
You are not alone. I've had some very dark lows myself. I have c-ptsd with anxiety major depressive disorder and repressed memories. I've been to that dark numb place where everything that could harm you reminds you of how much easier it would be. But don't give up. It may be that you are on a medication that doesn't work well for you. Or the dosing could be incorrect. I went through a dark period for weeks feeling like I just wanted to end it all I was numb and felt empty. I didn't have any real good support around. I finally got back to my doctor who adjusted my medication  and a few weeks later I started to feel better. It wasn't perfect fast and believe me I still have really bad days. But you are not alone. I am here if you ever need to talk.,1
"please feel free to express and even if you don,t want to just don,t do it pretending everything is okay is tough not only tough i think its just disgusting so stop it ,its you and only you who knows how u feel what kind of chaos going on in ur mind ,i had spent almost 2 years in bed just like doing nothing at that time only thought i had was as if am gonna pass away soon anytime hated everyone who tried to symptahize or help me then there came something and i really don,t know where it came from i mean the confidence that i can be normal again will smile again and it took years to that nothing is permanent you are in same situtaion like me the soon you want to get out of this shit ,the worse it gets so be patient medicines do work but it takes time meanwhile you better quit seeing normal people do not loose hope after all we all fall down and its not our Fault you just need to stop worrying about everything not only your illness but everything in ur life",1
Iv been there. Been on citalapram for years also got propananol for panic attacks. I often wish I could have a heartache or something to get help.. it's hard to get ppl to understand how it feels.. I struggle with feelings about selfharm and suicide when I'm low but there is another side. I try my hardest to tell myself tomorrow could be better.. or the next day.. fight it. Take care of yourself even if you have to be selfish.. the medication might help but 4 wks is probably not going to be long enough to notice any improvement.. I also find writing things down gets it out. You can read it later and see if you still feel the same or just bin it.. xxx,1
"I have never admitted it before to a group. I suffer every day. I was diagnosed with ""manic depression"" back in 1994. Now they say it's a bipolar disorder I've got? Idk what the hell I ""have"", but it is hard as hell to go through each day. I was a cutter. I did the suicide attempts and gained a bad liver and kidneys from it. I've smoked weed and it helped. But I would slip into these funks and it is so hard to get through them. Especially when I'm full of fear, shame, and self loathing during these times. It is so hard to let people see me that way. I've been struggling pretty badly today. That's why I  happened on here. It's a little easier knowing I'm not alone. Everyone who posted here, reminds me of myself in one way or another. Keeping focused on the small positives helps sometimes.  I hope you find strength and hope each day in little and large things. I always have to remind myself that I have control over my life.

 Thank you for sharing your story. I understand how hard that probably was, and how brave you are for reaching out. Idk about everyone else on here but when my loved ones watch me going through my episodes I just wanna hide. Or disappear. Sending hope and good vibes.",1
"Yeah. I don't want the world outside to exist sometimes. Like I'm trapped in my own head. It's hard to explain. But 2 of my kids are still young & I find myself setting them up with activities to keep them busy, and hiding in the shower  stall crying because I'm so depressed and I can't snap out of it. The doctors think I may have an OCD too and that feed my anxiety. During my episodes the feelings of no control, add to the flames of depression. And I spiral out of control. Other days it turns me listless. Those days I find someone to take care of the kids so they aren't contaminated by me. Sometimes just seeing people happy makes me depressed. Cause even when I'm happy I don't feel happy or it doesn't last. Sigh.

Thank you for sharing a part of ur world. It really really helps to know that others understand me. Even if my own family and support group don't truly understand my struggle. ♡",1
"I agree with so much of what you are saying.I was diagnosed bipolar 20years ago now, l have far greater problems with depression than mania.Struggle to get up every day and totally hide away won't answer the ph or door, push everyone away hate been seen, won't reach out or go to Dr just inside trying to distract myself with books puzzles film and feeling totally worthless....",1
It's going to get better your doing everything you can right now . Your going in the right direction.i felt the same like you . I actually had 3 sucides and I cam back from all of them. I happy now I got treat with the same meds your taking. If there not working ask for something eles. If you don't do anything all day it ok you are doing enough by surviving. Try baths or massage .I could not even leave my house bc of my anxiety I pretended for a long time to be fine . Therapy and meditation combo helped.,1
"Take a deep breath. I have experienced everything you have mentioned at one time or another. Make sure you stay in close contact with your Dr. 
I lived in constant fear that tomorrow would bring something that would cause me to give up. 
Nights are hard for me. So I made me tell myself ""it'll all be better in the morning."" I know IT will never be better, but concentrating on only making it till morning seems to be manageable.",1
"That you are reaching out to us is amazing.It's not that caring isn't in you it's just that everything in you is fighting to survive and you're exhausted.Just as this is terrifying for you ist is for those who love you too, so use what you have left to not pull away from them.
Going into Hosp as a Voluntary patient may be you answer.You can leave anytime it feels wrong and if it does work you will at last be able to let go and heal.Allow any med 10 days then change if not working.But ask for the side effects beacause we can be allergic and need to come off as fast as possible.I believe you can heal :-):-):-):-):-)",1
"I've been living with Bipolar Disorder, Chronic Depression, Extreme Anxiety, ADHD, Insomnia, OCD, BPD, PTSD, and Self Harm since I was 5... I am now about to turn 34. I have no memories of a ""normal"" life because I was born this way and it showed up early in my life. I have been on every medication, I have had unsuccessful ECT, I have been hospitalized a few times and seen countless therapists and psychiatrists.. the side effects of meds have almost driven me insane. I used to be embarrassed about my mental illnesses, but am trying to become and advocate for it. I am resistant to all treatments I haven't found much of anything that helps, but I have seen people get help and I have seen people be able to cope with it! Be as honest as you can with the friends and family you do have. I have been torn down by so many people I love, but I am choosing to be a warrior and fight this damn battle until one of us is dead! It's scary cause even as I write this I am suicidal and have a razor in my lap ready to make some more scars. I know that sounded not hopefully, but it's meant to show I have a long way to go, but look how far I have come!!! Everyday is different and a struggle and honestly just plain hell. Panic attacks always feel like your dying no matter how many you have! Medications can be helpful, you just need to find the right combo for you specifically.. it's a challenge, but hang in there. See your psychiatrist regularly and keep a journal of how you feel everyday not just oh good or bad.. rate your anxiety from 1-10 and your depression etc. then you can see what maybe is working and maybe what is not. See a Therapist often especially in the beginning talk about any and everything no matter how dumb or insignificant or embarrassing it might be.. you can learn some coping skills to help aid the meds. I believe in you! You can do this! If I can you can! It seems to me the people with mental illnesses are strong they just need to find that strength within them!! Hang in there. Recovery is a process not and event!",1
and you know what every morning i wake up after 15 mins my vision gets terribly disturbed i litreally see things moving where actually there is no movement at all but the only thing i know is one day it will be free of this shit,1
"I know as impossible as it may seem right now, these feelings/thoughts will not last forever. Don't give up. As hard as it is to feel this miserable you have to take it one day at a time. Hang on to one thing you have to live for. For me it was my kids, even though I truly believed with everything in me that they would be better off without me, the pain they would live with kept me breathing. Never give up.   ",1
I'm sorry you are going through so much turmoil. I know it is awful. It is definitely worth getting better. You can start enjoying g things again  and get a regular sleep schedule. It will a.so help with your desire to self harm. That doesn't do any body any good. If I were you I would go ahead and go to the hospital. It really does help. There is nothing to be afraid of or ashamed of. The help is there for you. Take it before it's too late,1

"Ive gained 20lbs. I absoutely hate it. Ive recently been going to the gym and trying to eat healthier. Sometimes i think I look okay. Im only 4'10. But then sometimes i can really see the weight. Its frusterating. I know i need the medication to help with my anxiety and depression, which it has. But its difficult sometimes looking in the mirror.",1
"Exactly, there are times I will worry about my weight, but I have to take other things into consideration. I will work out like crazy and lose twenty pounds at the most and plateau. I've just accepted it.",1
I replace breakfast and lunch with diet shakes and I'm losing small amounts of weight not a great deal. It's really hard.,1
I lost 180 lbs after my divorce. I lost 30 lbs and 150 lb man. When I became happy again I gained 30 lbs back. Not sure if it's the meds but it is horrible,1
"It has for me.  I've had a falloff because change of meds for anxiety,  re stepping back onto it.  Before,  I managed to lose 15kg just by controlling  my calories.  I am back where i started however,  I know it's possible. 

Using fitness pal to track all you eat is essential and helpful. Also big motivator to curb snacking on high calorie foods.  :)",1
I'm fine Hun honest don't worry babes xx,1
"Girl. I just got out of a marriage with someone that didn't get my anxiety at all. 
It was hard. But I left. I would rather be by myself, and wait for the true person that is going to love and accept me for me, anxiety and  depression and all and not going to get mad in the middle of the night because i need to breathe and need help. Because there is someone out there like that. Being alone and figuring out how to love myself has been such a great journey. Know your worth beautiful. Don't accept less than bullshit.",1
"I'm so sorry to hear that. It's horrible to be in that situation. Hopefully you found something to help.
If not writing do you draw? Or something else? Sometimes the distraction is the best thing for coping in the immediate.

If he's usually like this might be time to move on. Trust me when I said I made the jump and you don't need someone to survive. You are strong in yourself. And if you're worried about being lonely. If you've got the time and resources maybe consider a pet?
My cat is my saviour when I'm not doing well. She knows and comes and gives me cuddles.

Also your parents have no right telling you that you have to fix things when it's causing you severe distress to be with him. They should support you making the best decisions for you!",1

If you struggled with voices illusions suicide and huge stages of depression you would do a lot of blow drinking and drugs to have a little sunshine in your life too. Bipolar sucks live strong,1

"All of those saying they don't struggle, are the 40%.",1
"I believe this is true because substance abuse comes in all kinds of forms it's not just  drugs, it can be tobacco, shopping, gambling, drinking, porno, anything a person can turn into an addiction to try to mask the pain of this disease.....and I believe Bi polar disease goes hand in hand with STRESS ...our society over taxes our bodies with more stress than ever before.",1
I don't STRUGGLE....,1
"That depends. Are you part of the 60 percent that are likely to use drugs, or the 40 percent that don't have substance issues? Note the terms "" expected to struggle "". Just because you have the cravings doesn't mean you give in to them. It just means you struggle with them. You pious, sanctimonious, self righteous little prick.",1

Thank you Paul it's been a true struggle. After I quite I was diagnosed  Bipolar 2.,1
"Hyper-mania would be referred to as just mania. Mania is considered worse than hypomania as the severity of paranoid delusions, hallucinations etc are much worse. In my personal opinion that are both just as bad, hypomania is consistent with Bp2 which is harder to diagnose as the milder symptoms get dismissed or overlooked.",1
"I have had unwanted thoughts in the past and found them disturbing. I'd read that they can be due to nutritional impoverishment or emotional abuse. I'll go check it out online and report back. Remember always that you are part of humanity and your experience is never unique, many have similar experiences. Hugs.",1
"Bless you,  I used to be high flying multi tasking superwoman, now I get overwhelmed with too much work, but you are young and need to stick at this so personally I would take my medication and I would listen to some motivational getting up for a positive day guided meditation, I would listen to another one at lunch or break time and then another relaxing sleep talk down at night.  Good luck, I love my work again now but am just not as speedy as I used to be.  Good luck and don't let it beat you.xx",1
I'm struggling myself..,1
"I have been forced to take time off work, sick for up to a yr at a time due to my bipolar type 2. Im bk at work now but some days i get going no problems other days i battle with myself to get out of bed. I struggle to keep going and working can be so hard and drain me. But if i didn't force myself to go to work id be stuck at home feeling worse. Its hard but keep fighting ❤",1
"Due to my schizo effective and bi polar I haven't been able to hold a job for over 10 years. It makes me feel horrible like why can't I be a normal functioning adult and mom at the same time. It took a long time and the people who love me and the greatest man I met two years ago to help me realize that I may not be able to work like everyone else but I do a damn good job being a mom and taking care of so much more that's way more important than being a ""normal "" adult and holding a full time job. I got a job only working 3 hours a week and had a panic attack over that but I'm slowly working on getting there and it's helping. You'll get there too. But first thing comes first and that is you. If one thing I've learned is you gotta take care of you first. I still struggle with that but I'm getting there. And you will too. Hugs",1
I struggled with the same kind of thing whether it was school or work. I eventually ended up going on SSI,1
"I don't know if I have bipolar 2, but I have been struggling with depression and low self-esteem for a long time. Depression and anger cost me a job I only had for two weeks back in 2014.",1
"Up until the last 3 yrs I had worked full time as a primary teacher, then I had 2 yrs when I took a significant chunk of time off due to this. Last year I started full time and had an acute episode in April and haven't been back full time since, I tried part time but this yr, 2 days a week but have yet to have success, have been given till the middle of the year on sickness and will go from there. It has been horrendous, I have so much guilt from not being able to contribute to the family income. But I can't teach if I'm not even in my own body lol",1
"Totally get it.  Depression and anxiety have always been constants in my young adult life.  I had a mental breakdown back in December, and I have been out of work ever since.  It wasn't until January that I was formally diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder.  

The mere thought of going back to where I worked brings on a panic attack.  I constantly obsessed over what my coworkers thought of and were saying about me behind my back.  I always worry about being good enough.  Suicidal thoughts plague my life, and I have been hospitalized once for them.  There are times where I just want to wave the proverbial white flag and not wake up.  I have a really difficult compartmentalizing and dealing with stressors, both positive and negative.  Sometimes, I get so overwhelmed that all I can do is cry endlessly.  Most days I feel like a failure and a burden.  I'm only 27, and I am currently looking into disability options.",1
"I find my bipolar 2 is kind of cyclical. I can be very high functioning or unable to cope at all. Did the student/job/kids/exercise for a couple of years and then after a life change shifted back into bad habits and then a depressive episode where I can't cope again. 
Just take it easy on yourself. The transition from student to employee might of set you off so practice as much self care and eliminate as much stress as you can. I'm pregnant so was going off of work this year anyway and could use that as an excuse with my employer and keep my good reference. Without that circumstance though I would have chosen to focus on another area of my life to cut out some stress. 
You made it through school! You will transition and have a great career once you get through this depressive part of your cycle!",1

Thank you Brenton Gandy I don't ever want to be back where I was before my diagnosis.. when my doctor told me I have depression and anxiety I got with my family ( kids and husband ) to figure out an action plan . when my son was diagnosed a year ago with bipolar and syncophenia we put in an action plan for him as well .. he is almost 22 .,1

"I was very afraid to share this. Most people didn't know to the extreme I went or even that I was suffering. I felt stigmatized. But then, I realized that there are so many out there that feel all alone, like I did. And a guiding hand or a shoulder to cry on could help. I want to be that person. It was therapeutic to share my story. I cried in relief after I wrote this. So much weight was lifted. I pray others can have strength to keep fighting like the warriors they are.",1

Good luck to all of us in peril.",1
I'm crying. I read this all the way through and I am where you were. I'm scared and so alone and I can't ever stick with treatment because I can't keep up with copays. Everything is way out of control. I hope there is a life after where I am. I cried from start to finish and through comments.,1
"There IS!! oh honey, hang in there. The road is hard, but you're not alone. I'm here, even with whatever distance is between us, I understand that spot of fear, and unknowing. I lived it for longer than I thought bearable. You are so loved!! I'm not just saying this, I really will be here for you. Message me if you need to vent. Let me hold your hand.   ",1
"From the sounds of it she lives where I live and that will be no help.  They may possibly give her 1 dose of an anti anxiety med and send her out. Unless you've attempted suicide you get close to nothing.  They will call her med seeking and not help.  I was not suicidal but wanted to harm my children,went in immediately to be hospitalized. They put me in a hall on a bed for 12 hours in er then sent me home because I was no danger to anyone and they couldn't waste a bed on me",1
"I got free help at a state run facility while I was in Utah. I let slip that I was considering suicide a few years ago, my mom saw and got scared, she called my university health center, they called the cops, the cops paid me a visit and go me in. Not the preferred route, but I got the meds I needed and the only thing I was required to do was to go to a group therapy session once a week. Didn't matter which one, I just signed in and it counted. I would highly suggest going to the nearest department of health and welfare and explaining the situation. It may take you a few days, it may not, to see a doctor but they'll get you squared away. 

Do you have any family the kids can stay with in the area? It might be better for them; they won't get lost in the system, you can see them whenever, and they won't have to see you go through this. There's also the possibility that during one of your drunken moments, you hurt one by accident (I dunno if you're a mean drunk or not). You have to ask yourself, do you really wat you two precious little kids to see you do this to yourself?",1
"Yes, from all the comments here, there are many things you can do.

Check with your state to see what mental health services they offer. Most will have free meds for you. And you can call their emergency number which is listed on the state website. 

Some states do use the first call for help line of 211. 

And hospitals will help. You will not lose your kids as long as you show you are getting help. Social Services may visit you in the hospital to see how you are doing, but that's ok. As long as you have a stable and safe, clean home, they won't take your child. Most of the time they don't even get involved unless someone calls to make a charge, so don't worry",1
Yep I am off my meds for 6 months. Miserable and not functional. To go see a new dr with no insurance is ridiculous.,1
U WILL NOT lose ur kids if u get help. Thats absurd. If anything it shows ur taking care of urself. I live in the states as well..ive been hospitalized a few times and still have my child...there was never a threat that i wouldnt so please dont let that deter u from getting help.,1
"She's the one who said she was afraid her kid would be taken away. So I assumed the dad is not there.

And from what was written it seems she can have the meds if she goes to an appointment but she can't afford to go to the appointment. I.e. no car or no gas money.  Which is why I suggested medical transport.  We have it in MI but I do t know about other states. We also have your ride which is similar but you have to pay for it and it's like 2 bucks",1
"Cut them off! It is what I had to do with my family. They knew, knew more than I. Hospitalized twice in my teens and no one would tell me what was wrong. Chose, instead, to demonize me for using drugs (really didn't want to see me without them). Knew I was sick yet chose to judge me as a horrible person and dope fiend. When I finally found out and that they know all along, I cut them off. I don't need them.",1
"I have excepted what I am, my worst fears I see it in my kids and don't know what to do to help",1
Colleen I'll listen to you I've struggled for 20 years and girl I've survived you can too!!!,1
"And!... Just to top it off... I've lost all confidence in my gp... Who doesn't think I'm bipolar, how can I express how I feel when I have to judge people's response before I even open my mouth? Well!!... Guess what?!... I haven't been able to "" pull myself together "" or ""give my head a wobble"" for over twenty years... My world gets smaller n smaller every day. But I go on... Fight... Struggling along... With something no-one sees...",1
"Their life is not my obligation. I owe them no debt. I will say what I will. If what I say hurts you, it is YOUR obligation, YOUR duty to avoid me. If you can't, that's not on me.

That being said, there ARE people that use it to garner attention, or that do it as a fad. I have met plenty.",1
I always feel better after I have done it. Feels like a release of pressure.  Not done it for a long time now. I have my son to live for now. I think those days are gone for me now.,1
I exercise hard now instead but no for me my self harm (cutting and burning) was cathartic it was the only way I knew to reset my brain when it got overloaded with negative thoughts or I get stuck in my analytical loop it was how I started breathing again. Mine was also hidden on parts of the body that werent seen...so yeah defo not for attention...but I find working out or doing yoga actually helps the burn in my muscles helps in the same way :) but Im not bipolar I suffer major depression and anxiety,1
I use to do this.. For those reasons.. Rub the scares when I get upset..promised I wouldn't do it anymore..,1
Alcohol and drugs will not only interfere with your antidepressant it is potentially very harmful to your unborn child.  To be honest your post come across as being a bit blase you need to take to take some  responsibility. Depression and anxiety are not excuses for being aggressive towards other people. Has anyone mentioned anger management to try and find more positive ways to deal with your emotions and anger. Don't know how old you are but you sound fairly young. Are you really ready to be responsible for another human being? It doesn't sound as if you are particularly as you are doing things that could harm your baby.  Seek support from your family friends or social services as you are going to need it. However you also need to work towards better health it doesn't just happen by itself unfortunately. Wish you good luck.,1
"I would recommend to see. Therapist.  Also maybe change your meds. Also energy drinks trigger, anxiety and depression,drinking with meds wrosen your simtons . It also think you might have bipolar 3 borderline personality disorder I am not a doctor or specialist​. But I been treated for over 12 years so I seen tons of therapist and take natural  meditation as well as Western medicine.accupunture works for me massage meditation. I also stress levels cause change to your depression . Not having a job allows more time to think. Try to keep busy if you can go for a walk take a bath. Juice fast my work too. You can do 3days. Coconut oil reduces inflammation in the brain. Omega too helps the brain function better. Ginger . Like I said this is all the stuff that has worked for me. I am not a specialist. Try talking to a therapist sometimes when you voice the ideas you have in your brain it loses it power. Writing . Pick up a new hobby till you get your job. Don't worry on the thing you can't control. Do small progressive thing around the house stuff you can actually control. Don't rominate about stuff thing eventually work them self out . I had 3 suicide and I was revived from all of them. I happy I was I have done a ton of wonderful thing and picked up a ton of hobbies I getting to see my daughter grow up. Your son needs more then you think you can't replace a parent . One thing at a time . Maybe the pressure of becoming a new parent might of triggered your depression. But taking your life is not the way out you need to see your son grow. I been through 2 divorces .And I have survived there been dark times but I kept doing thing until I got better. Exercise has helped me alot also. I wish you luck and I hope I have helped in any way. Having a mental illness is not the end of your life learn to except it and finding new ways to deal with it like any disease it's not the end all. Your life is just beginning",1
Sweetie get on different medication. Does your area offer anger management classes or anxiety classes,1
I know you are right I just worry about what they would think of me.,1
"What if your struggling and no one knows how to help.  When you wake up from a dead sleep feeling like you're  drowning. When ppl tell you how to fix your situation but you can't bring yourself to do it.  For what ever reason.  I'm lost,  I don't know what to do.",1
"you need to get help, that deep of depression osnt something you can help him woth, you need a pro. but i agree with eveyone else, if the threat is real you need to tell someone or get him to a hospital.",1
"I suffer from Bipolar, Mdd, PTSD, psychosis and anxiety/panic disorder. I suffered since age 13. I tried every medication out there, I got so bad in October I did 16 rounds of ECT.  It was a life changer for me, then it wore off, so we tried Lithium and vraylar quetiapine and prozac and it brought me back up. There is a treatment and medication out there it takes time to find it. I researched alot myself and luckily my Dr. Was listening to me and was willing to try new things. Keep trying never give up hope it took 25yrs to get to where I am at today.",1
"If he's threatening to take his life, you need to call for help. All threats of suicide should be taken seriously.",1
"My husband also suffers from depression and to be honest I found that just being there next to him, whether it's sitting in the bed just reading or being in the house as much as I can is a great comfort. We aren't all capable of expressing our feelings and at those times I just leave it until he is up to talking. Being bipolar myself I know how much I can give him before it affects me and I feel no guilt about it. A weak me is going to be no good if he is weak too.",1
"If he's threatening to kill himself, the threat should be taken seriously.  If he's got a therapist, that person should be notified (at the least).  If he's on medication, it may be failing and something new may be needed.  At the worst, he may need to be hospitalized again, which (I'm sure) is not something either of them want to hear.  If he's a danger to himself, his health and welfare is more important than anything else.  The poster may want to help their boyfriend, but the truth is that they likely don't have the necessary skill set to do it and are too close to the problems.  An informed professional might be able to give him a better perspective on things.  The boyfriend needs to be talking to a therapist or needs to be in the hospital right now if he's gotten this bad. That's the only advice I have, sadly.  :(",1
I recently completed a 6 week treatment of TMS for my depression and has worked wonders. I completed the treatments about 2 months ago and haven't been on medications except for my anxiety meds since almost the first treatment.,1
"You sound an aweful lot like me. I was diagnosed with bipolar 16 some years ago and went through a really bad depression/high anxiety bout about a year and a half ago. I've been treated like a guinea pig over the years with one med after the other which has made me very hesitant to change. I also deal with low sex drive and my husband was (and still is) my biggest supporter. But I finally found the right combination of medication, therapy, and I've become a facilitator for DBSA where I can help others who are still struggling. I know changing meds can be scary but you owe it to yourself to be 100% the person you can be.",1
"I know how you feel, I felt thst way since I was 13 years old. It's crippling and you lose hope and faith. I suffer from bipolar, Mdd,  psychosis, anxiety/panic disorder and PTSD. I was put on everything from the moon at back. I finally underwent ECT with keto mine treatment 16 rounds. It wore off 2 months ago. Fearing I needed more ECT I went back to my Dr. And we went with lithium, vraylar,   quetiapine, clonazepam. It has been a great success. I regained my hope and faith in life. It took 25 yrs but I can't remember the last 6 years of my life.  Which Iam ok with. There is still hope. Never stop looking. Try old medications with new ones. There's something out there. If it gets really bad try Clozaril it's not just for schizophrenia patients, they treat hard to treat depression with it. Hang in there",1
"I so know where you are and what you are feeling, 
sadly there are no easy answers.  When you are at this point of distress and frustrated,  you need to go back to basics.   start again and stick to your medications to work. if you are not experiencing the worst reactions, it takes 6 weeks to be effective . trust me I know, 100 tries later for me. there are new meds now that are terrific, called  5th generation, bipolar, depression , Im on a assortment, plus this new one, I, in 40 years feel great.   Please ask your doctor,....these are all 
systemic of our disease and it sucks,...
God bless you,....",1

It's a struggle daily not to self harm . I hope I made it through this day,1
"All i ÷ver hear is how crazy and psycho i am. I just cant take it anymore. After 8 years and many ups and downs we have decided to split up. I know in my heart it is over. I am so terrified i am going to fall into depression or mania which she predicted. And some other very harsh things. 
Im just tired of the stigma and falling in it sometimes. It sucks. Thanks for the rant.",1
That person is most likely a narcissist and would find a way to make you look guilty/bad regardless of your mental issues. Trust me on this. #NarcissismSucks,1
I agree it's so damn irritating. One person said yo me your meds are making you mad. Really!!!!,1
"It's hard, I've been there many times. If you have a good day you must be manic, if you have a bad day you're depressed. If you get mad or upset with someone for the way they treat you you're crazy and need to get your meds in check. I wish I knew the answer.",1
I use to have that problem but now I'm on tygretol and wellbutrin and a new anti psychotic called sulfris not sure if I spelt that right and have had no weight gain issues. There is no associated weight gain with any of those and they work very well. My diagnosis goes between bi polar and schizo effective with agoraphobia and high anxiety but those meds seem to keep me very stable. I was over 300lbs and yes I had help losing 175 of it but since then and the new meds I've had no issues with weight gain.,1
"I take lithium olanzapine and mirtazapine for bipolar psychosis and anxiety. Yes they mean weight gain. Over the past 3 yrs I've managed to lose 35kg ( not sure what that is in pounds) which isn't a lot but it's still a loss. I replace breakfast and lunch with diet shakes, in particular optifast which I really like) and I have a small dinner trying to avoid carbs if possible. I have chronic pain as well so moving is very painful but I manage to walk 2 20 min blocks 5 days a week to and from work and the train station. I'm lucky that I have no choice to walk if I want to work. It's difficult and can be demotivating at times but it is possible. Take care.",1
I'm afraid to get one.  What if I get tired of it? I'm so indecisive.,1
Oh yeah. After my first miscarriage I spiraled down a dark depression hole I hadn't been down in a long time. Almost destroyed my relationship with my now husband. I needed to mother something so when I brought up getting a kitten my husband jumped on it and agreed. Ended up finding a bonded pair siblings we couldn't separate so they both came home with us. They pulled me out of that hole and saved me and my relationship. My boy is currently curled up on my hip as I type. Hes always near me and knows when I'm upset or sick and he takes care of me.,1
"Never say can't. I struggled since a young age with schizoeffective disorder and borderline personality disorder. Been hospitalized many times, and tried to kill myself twice. I received healing, and if I believed that I could not overcome this horrible deepest darkest nightmare, I probably would not be here today. The struggle is real, but there is hope.",1
A daily struggle,1

"I'm sorry that's not true. And what's more, the bible doesn't teach that. And it won't back you, God is merciful and kind and The book of proverbs speaks repeatedly of his understanding. The bible shows many who suffered from different illnesses and sense then, many more plague people. Furthermore, the letters to the congregations and the apostles in the greek scriptures share more detail of how we should console the depressed. Don't use the bible to crush the helpless. I live in a family plagued by this illness and trust me if it was all in the head, fearing God wouldve cured it a century ago. You should stop talking. And you are still quite ignorant...",1
"If societies expectations and institutionalisation wasnt so limited we wouldnt be suffering from these mental states, we are not born into this world to be trained and taught how to live in only one acceptable state, we are here for a purpose to share our natural positive gifts that cannot shine or enlighten us in a blinded high society that corrupts all that is natural and beautiful in ourselves and our beautiful world of abundance created to sustain us and all living things. Instead we bow down to monarchy and legal chaos to survive, not intune with the divine essence of our human race, but the disgrace of hypocricy and uncertainty of ourselves",1
Don't think I'm anxious anymore more fucking angry than anything else but now on meds and feel calm and at times depressed,1
I can't even read it because of the red background.  The contrast will trigger an anxiety attack if I force myself to read it.,1
"What others do or think can make us hesitate to take a stand, until we realize God holds the now and future in His hand.",1
"I live in Aust and work in this system,   Firstly get your keys back , even if it means police involvement,make your self safe.  The unfortunately.. until he actually hurts himself or someone you can't do anything.. so gently with someone there for support. Tell him he can't come to your house making threats and treating you that way ,  because of his age and reguadless of his age you can't do anything unless you are his legal guardian,  then he can't get a passport without your signature..   but it's a lot of legal stuff and  he needs to. Agree unless deemed unfit .. but none of this will happen without him having an incident that called for legal interjection... the law is very definitive for people with disabilities. And mental health...  if you are threatened again or frightened lock yourself in the car or go to a neighbour and call police. This can initiate the process. He needs proper support from professionals maybe even a stay in a locked facility because you can't force him to take meds.. and even a group home isn't gonna help him in this state esp if he's violent .  There are lots of rules in group homes.    You need to get the police involved have him sectioned to a ward for evaluation for fear of your and community safety.      It's really awful to go through but please put yourself first and be safe..     ",1
Just remember the page you are on and the people who are giving advice. You are all he has and now the his mother has passed he is surely lost. The trauma of losing her is most likely horrible for him as it is for you. Try to find this woman and explain the situation if you can . Maybe just maybe she is ignorant of his disability's.,1
"He definitely needs professional care so hospitalization may be best. He is clearly not capable of taking care of himself, and while it's good of you to worry and obviously try to help, it is beyond your ability. Especially if he resorts to violence. Putting yourself in harm's way to try to protect him is doing NO ONE any benefit.",1
"If you are worried about your physical safety, him having your house keys and all, call the police and make a report. Then call mental health services in whatever state you live in and the police report will help fast track your brother to being seen and evaluated. Can't imagine what you're going through but the outbursts and threats/ physical violence are a priority in this situation.",1
"Two points: 1. Don't bring him to America.  2. A hospital stay can only help, don't fear the unknown- it's all trial and error.",1
"Since he's 30 can you even commit him to hospital without his consent if he's not currently a threat to himself or others? I'd call someone for  legit advice, hospital, police. If he is violent. Or let him make his own mistakes, maybe he will learn about himself and the world if he goes to America",1
With his history he must be well known to services or have a case worker? If you have contact numbers ring them as soon as you can. He is your brother but he is not your responsibility. It is never easy to do this. He is vulnerable and needs protection as much as you and your family do.,1
"You need to get him professional help, he needs it for himself and for the women he threatens. Don't feel bad, you'll be doing the best thing for him.",1
Yes..call a hospital because he is a vulnerable adult. He is mentally incapable to make such a risky plan.. He also needs to get his his violent temper under control before he really hurts them..or maybe even kills them. I know he is your brother and you love him. But only tough love will help him.  Call Hospital!,1
You need help call for help don't feel guilty just do it and live your life.. protect your self and him call for help,1
"I have a nephew like this. He has thrown stuff, hit us his grandmother included, wrapped his hands around our throats till finally we had to literally choose did we want to live in fear of what he could or would do to us and/or others. After battling years and him physically attacking a police officer, the courts understood our plea and put him in a mental institution. It's never the ideal situation.",1
Don't do nothing for me or my anxiety 400 mg 3 times a day. I'm start to only use it once with my Xanax when I have a bad panic attack just because,1
I believe this person is describing mindfulness. It is a great tool in keeping in the moment and not obsessing about that which you cannot control. Rather it is a means of acceptance of yourself and that in which you can change.,1
"I am on Gabopentin for anxiety, and it knocks me out. I sleep all night. I have never been able to do that with any other med.",1
"I am on olanzapine/zyprexa for psychosis, mood stabilising and anxiety including anxiety induced insomnia. I sleep petty well now. The thing that is disturbing my sleep is pain now but when that is under control I really do sleep well. I also take lithium and mirtazapine. I have bipolar and anxiety.",1
Have you considered  using cannabis for stress and anxiety?,1
"I have about 7 years of success with Zyprexa. For Bipolar, for anxiety, for insomnia (to some degree. I black out for 5 hours during which I'm said to be sleeping. Then up and down almost every hour since... going back on the ambien too. 10mg of Zyprexa isn't touching my insomnia).",1
Zyprexa doesnt help me personally with sleep or anxiety.. i use ambien a few days then lunesta for sleep.,1
I took ambien for about two years and it started doing that to me. I too cannot figure out what works for sleep. I wish I knew. it is awful to have a horrible day and then lie in bed all night having panic attacks. Good luck to you. A low dose of Xanax helps me now but that also comes with its own demons. Wish I could help you more but I am in the same boat.,1
I suffer from bipolar and anxiety and I take lithium and quetiapine plus diazapam,1
Does it not affect anxiety more though does it chill you out ?,1
"My advice would be to seek advice from a professional, read about different anti depressants and their possible side effects - dint think anyone who has responded to your question as referred to anti depressant which is what you are asking about many antidepressants are also good for  anxiety ocd etc too. Any drug has side effects ranging from minor to more severe and very common and rare. Sometimes you need to weigh up benefits of a drug against side effects and  accept themas long as they are not severe.",1
"Zonisamide followed by Lithium, both are mood stabilizers with agents designed to swat anxiety!",1
I use olanzapine. It's a mood stabiliser antipsychotic and it provides a calm from anxiety. I'm also on lithium and mirtazapine. All 3 can cause weight gain so I'm not sure which one or all to it but it has been the best for me. Outside medication I also use mindfulness. It has been a godsend. It's easy to do. You practice while you are feeling ok so when you start to feel anxious you can use it. Check it out online you can even get apps for your phone.,1
"Thanks Sue. I don't like to see guys treating people in an adverse way, it gets us all tarred with same brush. Her guy has issues but she is not the cause, if anything he is the cause of her anxiety. . . I hope she gets support via this group who will put her in the right direction of realising her true worth, once she accepts how important she is she will be able to then choose who she shares her life with and not feel she has to stay with a manipulative jerk because he has made her lose her own identity to support his. . . .   ",1
"Your guy is a control freak and using what is known as projection techniques making you feel everything is your fault, he is incapable of thinking of you as he is a narcissist and wants the world to revolve around him. You need someone who will support you when you're low and share the bad times as well as the good and not lay the blame at your feet. . . You are worth more than he is but you need to show him this. . . Tell him to take a hike and come back when he appreciates what your feeling, what depression and anxiety is and how low it makes you feel. Once he has had a taste of you not caring about him and concentrating on yourself it may teach him a serious life lesson. If not your better off on your own. . . Don't allow yourself, your feelings or emotions be manipulated by a fool that doesn't support YOU!. . . Good luck  ",1
"My mom does this to me sometimes. My partner and I chose to get married abroad and she decided she didn't want to come, blamed money but we had offered to pay for her flight and she found an excuse anyway. Two days before we were due to fly she rang me and said that I didn't see what I was doing, that it was because I was bipolar and depressed that I wasn't considering her feelings and we should essentially be doing things on her terms. It upset me massively.

Thing is, it wasn't me. I had done everything to include her and she had refused. It was a means for her to try to gain control over me. We went ahead with the wedding and didn't let her stop me. 

You might love your partner lots, but you have to ask yourself why he is doing this. Is he trying to control you too? x",1
"Yup.... We make up being depressed, fearful, manic.... So much fun! We love messing with people, starting fights, being told it's all in our heads.... I'm sorry if a doc diagnosed us then they arent the ones that are wrong but our family and friends that treat us like liars are.",1
"The problem with those with mental illness is they can easily be taken advantage of and people can easily manipulate them, make them feel like they are crazy, at fault all that time because they refuse to take responsibility for their own actions. The gaslighting mentioned by Alice sounds a lot of what he's doing. If he refuses to see that you are I'll and making an effort to get better and be supportive, I know this sucks, you don't need him. It's not healthy for you to constantly struggle to be better so you don't lose a relationship that is not doing well because your partner is manipulating you into feeling worse. 

Focus on you, your health and mentality is all that matters right now not him.",1
"And it seems like her comment is gone. Talking herself up like she chose help and we don't ""I'm a success story, I'm not a victim, your opinion is your own IM going to continue to better myself"" saying we aren't trying. We sit in this group and play victim oh and we are insecure apparently. She's all perfect now because she doesn't get mad lol. And because she chooses to love and have confidence. She made me feel like a piece of shit! Well if she's all better she can leave. She was a piece....",1

As far as being worried because ssri don't agree with you. This isn't of the ssri medications.",1
"I did on on seroquel xr and celexa which is am anti depressant. Or just wasn't the right fit though and I kept having breakthrough episodes, mostly of hypomania. And I had to stay on my anti-anxiety meds. But I tried it for almost two years so it didn't have any major side effects.",1
"I've been on that combo for about 4 years now. It's honestly the only combo to work for me. I've been on almost every med they make, and was diagnosed bipolar 2 when I was 13. I also have 3 children. The Seroquel xr wasn't for me. It made me feel like I have restless leg syndrome. I hope you find that it works as well for you",1
Ask for Sertraline. Taken in the morning  it keeps u on track in the day and its effects stil help u sleep in the evening. I do not have bipolar.

In Australia prescription medication isn't allowed to be advertised. Only the over the counter stuff. It would annoy me using actors although a person with anxiety and/or depression might be too anxious or depressed to actually do an ad. What would be good is if they consulted with people that are affected by the illness and maybe had people say what it's really like so am actor had a small understanding of what it's like.,1
"Talk to her we are all different as for me I don't like to talk to my husband about it, it's embarrassing so I just want him to leave me alone and give me space when I cry.",1
Just be understanding. My wife left me about 4 months ago because she didn't know how to handle my anxiety and depression because it was so hard to explain to her how badly it changed who I was. Just be supportive and listen. If she's worth it to you keep fighting and know she's not doing it to upset you.,1
"Let me first say that I think it's awesome that you're reaching out to see how best to handle this situation and the love that shows you have for your fiancee. I have been with my husband for 15 years now, married for nine of them. The best advice he would give is never minimize or make fun of the way she's feeling something. Bipolar people in general feel things more intensely. People in the hypomanic (bipolar 1) spectrum feel things even more deeply. We are prone to be more angry, fearful, and hurtful to those closest to us. In my case I would constantly question why anyone would want to be with me. Do not take this as a personal attack against you. It is more indicative of how we feel about ourselves. Gently make sure she is taking care of herself--meds, proper rest, proper eating, etc. When I'm in a depressive low, my husband has to remind to shower. Read and educate yourself on the disorder, triggers, and symptoms so you can help see if a cycle is happening. Even if she gets angry with you, do it anyway. Most importantly, remember that she is a person, not a mental illness and that's who you fell in love with in the first place. Good luck to you both.     ",1
"I've read a lot of posts but I eventually cried over yours, and I began to feel sick to my stomach that I had nothing rightful to say to you in the moment. So I shut my phone and ran an errand, got my composure back, and me back, and eventually returned to you. I think you have to call upon your son and open up. Write a list first of what's wrong, and then give it to him to process. You must give your son an open door to possibly collaborate to help you. It would be absolutely cruel of you to take your life without giving him a chance to earnestly help you. He's your son, he loves you more than words ever do. Second, there are people called life coaches. This ties in to you wanting to get back to your old self. These folks have seen it all, nothing to be shy about. Try it, you've got nothing to lose. I do happen to believe that serious depression benefits from mood stabilizers since anti depressants can make things way worse. Talking Lithium, Zonisamide type drugs with a sprinkling of antidepressant. And force yourself to write down a list of what you know you enjoy even though you aren't doing it. Share it with your son and the life coach. Collectively you'll gently come up with a plan. No more talk of suicide or those thoughts for at least a month, just Barr them from having any power over you. Not an option. I just gave you a slew of things to do my friend!! Xxxx",1

If they really don't like you, they will soon be out of your life but try to enjoy their company as they pass through it. 

Some will stick around and will be willing to wait for you to ""open up."" In a few months/years/whatever you may actually feel different towards them and feel more trusting and secure. 

I know it is difficult, I'm going through this process myself. But I'm slowly giving up a life of isolation for a life with a few acquaintances who may one day be friends. And I'm winning as I'm not so isolated any more. Still have no friends who I totally trust but maybe that will come. But as I say, I'm already ahead by being able to join in with company.

Setting an alarm has worked wonders and now I eat on or around the time the alarm is set naturally because I'm so used to doing it.",1
Stay on your meds. See your Dr and get a good therapists. I'm in the same boat. Exercise some way it alleviates depression and anxiety.,1
"After my visit to docs today to be told "" ive been seeing that docs place for 2 yrs and should be normal now and taking my meds not trying to lessen or zero my meds and still have anxiety days..."" i felt like telling him my anxiety has been with me for over 2 decades.   And have always done what everyone wanted me to do to get better.  Not what i needed to do to get better.   And in the last year or two i have had improvements.  And what the hell is normal.  Im different.  Not broken.  Im me.  I would rather be interactive with my mental health plan...not complacent and just take what im told.",1

"Serious therapy. Medication. If that doesn't work and you still worry about being a danger to yourself or someone else, hospitalization. I was TERRIFIED of what that would mean but admitting myself to the hospital saved my life.",1
"Glad to hear you are going back to therapy, that is the first step, you may also want to concider medications if you are not already; they have helped me a lot (diagnosed at 8 as well). In the meantime...if you feel a mood swing take a step back. Remove yourself from the situation and breath slowly, concentrate on your body limb by limb slowly and relax; meditation can help too.  it sounds silly but it can work. The self harm will be more tricky, it helped me to keep my hands busy during triggering situations. I took up knitting, crocet, and drawing. it also helps distract from the anxiety, giving you something manual to concentrate on.",1
"If it gets bad, go to the hospital.  Don't fuck around.   I cut my throat in November and was hospitalized for 11 days.  Got out, family abandoned me, wife left, lost job.  Now I'm trying to rebuild my life.  Don't wait too long.  If you're feeling suicidal, go to the hospital.   Now I have a nice scar.  No shame in going for help.",1
"You are ill.... You know you are ill and are trying to get help that in itself is difficult and very brave of you. For the first time ever I've been in the same situation and to be honest I've felt shame but that is the illness shaming because you and I have nothing to be ashamed about. Things get so overwhelming and out of control and for me I self harm to change my focus because I'm clearly not taking care of myself and it forces me to do that. I'm not sure what your reason is but changing your focus is important but finding a healthy way to do that is even more important. Especially finding  something to keep your focus that you enjoy doing.... Art, colouring, reading, watching tv, cooking for friends, asking for help. Don't be afraid to ask for that.

I'm not sure what relationship you have with your family but if you are close to them, they will understand. If not find other avenues of support. You need to surround yourself with people who will stick with you and realize how difficult that level of control is or can be. If you want them in your life write them a letter or sit down and talk to them.... Tell them what you need and why, tell them that you need them, that you love them. Doing that is all you can do and sometimes knowing that you atleast tried is all you can do. 

Focus on you and your health.... I wish the best for you and your struggle ❤️",1

"I have more than just dogs, and my only current dog is my service dog. I am more worried about my various reptiles who need various things because they are rescues and come to me as special needs. Anything from every few hours of hand watering and a few times a day of hand feeding to just giving meds once a day. The issue is I have their trust, a lot of them could seriously injure who ever watches them. I also have birds and rodents and cats too. One of my cats is a diabetic. Until I can find someone to take care of all of them I can't in good conscious ever put myself first. And cost is one of the things that holds me back. I have a vet who could do all of them. But it would likely cost several hundred dollars for all of them just for 24 hours. I would rather put that towards their vet fund. I feel there should be a simpler answer... But I guess there isn't. Thanks for all the suggestions everyone",1

"First of all, why would we compare them? They're both horrible and unacceptable. But if we are going to compare them - physical abuse can become murder and it almost always comes with emotional abuse. Emotional abuse alone is dreadful, and I wish no one ever experienced it, but I can't say it's worse. Again, why compare? Stop them both!",1
Chronic persistent emptiness and low mood is one of the characteristics of BPD. When I was much younger I used to overdose like you every few weeks partly as I felt so bad I wanted to be in physical pain  but also to cleanse and start again as I would try to do things get on with my life but things would always just spiral downwards every few weeks.  At the time I don't think I had insight but looking back. I do still self harm I hadn't for years up until past few years when things have been bad again. I'm in the UK and I was diagnosed with BPD about 25 yrs ago at a time when it wasn't even thought to be a proper mental illness and as a result no treatment. I have since been diagnosed with BP2 and also suffer from depression and anxiety. Things have changed since then and it is recognised as serious MI and therapy especially DBT which is a form of CBT is the most beneficial. So far as medical records I don't think anyone has ever mentioned BPD or any other of my diagnoses in any detail. GP or consultants and OH  always write in very general terms in what they say they may refer to underlying MH issues but they will not specify diagnosis. I have always worked in my adult life and have been on long term sick several times recently 3 months and 11 months 2015-2016 and 8 months in 2012-2013. The medical line from hospital basically says nothing and GP will ask what you want put on your line is stress depression etc  I have never really had specific therapy for my BPD so it has been  always underlying everything.  There's no specific medication for BPD but  depression anxiety  commonly accompany BPD or as a consequence of how it impacts on your life. Even on the medications especially antidepressants which I know help I still struggle with feelings of emptiness and pointlessness and feeling worthless but I can tell when I'm also severely depressed and when I'm not. Of course you may not have BPD but it isn't to be ashamed of and unless you tell people no one will know.,1
"Thank you. I sometimes feel like my thoughts and sadness are just in my head and I need to just snap out of it, but I've tried to ""just snap out of it""...it doesn't work. So I just kind of ""coast through life"" with the fake smile and the ""I'm oks"". Then I feel guilty because my issues aren't ""real"" issues, then I'm angry for feeling like this. And, then the pretending like it's all ok. The never ending cycle of ups and downs, I sometimes feel like I'm living ""Groundhog Day"" over and over and over. How do I deal with this never ending feeling of hopelessness? I just can't, no matter how hard I try, or how much I read about it, or how hard I try to lie to myself that it will all be ok.",1

If you should feel guilty towards your niece, you can still pay her a visit to wish her good luck... if she doesn't appreciate the gesture, that's her problem! try to find at least one person who accepts you for who you are, where you can rely on, and understands that you're not always upto being around people ... it makes a big difference if you have ""a person"", then you won't feel so alone... you are worthy of having someone who you don't have to explain yourself to... just being you should be/IS enough! big hug to you!",1

I know this is hard but my Brother got me this book that was titled""Don't sweat the small stuff,and it's all small stuff"" mind you my Sister nlaw told me after my Brother killed himself this past September 22....There is 10 months and 3 days between both suicides My Dad was my abuser....And my Brother only months before told me he knew why my Dad did to me(a blessing) Since I carried the nightmare since I was young and now I 50.  It was hard to tell myself it's all small stuff after I was the last to talk to my Brother before he killed himself...But he was sick and he isn't suffering with esphogaus and stomach cancer...Which he got from being in the Marines/ Camp Lagune NC drinking contaminated water the whole military base was...Life is really hard for most of us out there and you have to take time for yourself..To heal.what you are troubled about Hopefully you will find some peace hopefully you have a friend you can talk to...Do you have an animal who needs you and can give you some unconditional love...

I'm really pushing myself to go, because he's my only sibling and I helped raise him, I just really want to be there. I'm not going to let my mental illness stop me. BUT, that's my situation. If there is an abuser in that scenario, or your mental health is too overwhelming right now, you have every right to not go. Do what YOU need to do, to stay safe and stable. You can't help what you have and it isn't your fault. Don't let anyone make you feel guilty for something you didn't chose to have in the first place. I hope you are able to slow down and settle for a little while. You will get back to where you need to be. Huge hugs <3",1
"Put yourself first. I wouldn´t go if it triggered me. This is one of those times you need to cut out the toxic people in your life. If they can´t understand what you´re going through, than you don´t need them to bring you down. Either they respect your wishes, or they don´t. It may seem like alienation, but you´re trying to survive with mental illnesses. You can´t control the way your mind is. They will come back around when they realize you´re trying to make yourself better. Seek therapy and stay in it. It´s hard for people like me with Borderline to find a good therapist or stay in therapy. I highly suggest DBT. That´s a good therapy for Borderlines. We are our greatest enemies. It´s okay to say no. Don´t worry about pleasing everyone. Your sanity will thank you, for putting you first. Those people have their own issues they need to work on themselves. Yoga helps, writing in a journal, helps. DBT helps replace negative thinking with positive thoughts. Find positive quotes online and write them down. Start with one little thing that´s positive and work on that. You´ll see a slow change.",1
"Great advice! I agree! I'm on my 3rd week of group DBT therapy and was hesitant at first but it's actually comforting to know I'm not alone and now with a caring group of people.

Not knowing her whole situation (whether the niece knows or not) she may be trying to show she cares by insisting for her being there maybe not knowing? 

If she knows, then she should definitely be more understanding. If not, it's good to know she cares enough to want her there, I know not being wanted is a bad feeling as well.

It's a shame abusers go unpunished. In a perfect world, she'd be able to attend and that jerk would be banned. Sad.",1
Medication is only part of the solution. I have bipolar I and anxiety disorder. I would strongly suggest seeing a psychologist/therapist. While you are waiting do some research on cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness. They have been a godsend. Therapy along with the right meds mean I can hold down a good full time job now. I have my bad days and I tend to collapse on the weekend. It I still feel I have a purpose. Medication can be a lot of trial and error. It took me 18 mths to get the right combo. Also be careful of xanax. You can either grow dependant on it or you can just get used to it so you need more to give you adequate relief. Chat to your dr about your meds and therapy. It can and does get better. It just takes time.,1

"Underlying Factors
“Much of the decision to die is in the construing of events,” says Kay Redfield Jamison, professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She adds: “Most minds, when healthy, do not construe any event as devastating enough to warrant suicide.” Eve K. Mościcki, of the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health, notes that many factors—some of them underlying—work together to lead to suicidal behavior. Such underlying factors include mental and addictive disorders, genetic makeup, and brain chemistry. Let us consider some of them.
Foremost among these factors are mental and addictive disorders, such as depression, bipolar mood disorders, schizophrenia, and alcohol or drug abuse. Research in both Europe and the United States indicates that more than 90 percent of completed suicides are associated with such disorders. In fact, Swedish researchers found that among men who were not diagnosed with any disorders of that kind, the suicide rate was 8.3 per 100,000, but among the depressed it jumped to 650 per 100,000! And experts say that the factors leading to suicide are similar in Eastern lands. Still, even the combination of depression with triggering events does not make suicide inevitable.
Professor Jamison, who once attempted suicide herself, says: “People seem to be able to bear or tolerate depression as long as there is the belief that things will improve.” However, she has found that as the cumulative despair becomes unbearable, the ability of the mental system to restrain suicidal impulses gradually weakens. She likens the situation to the way that the brakes on a car are worn thin by constant stress.
It is vital to recognize such a trend because depression can be treated. Feelings of helplessness can be reversed. When the underlying factors are dealt with, people may react differently to the heartaches and stresses that often trigger suicide.
Some think that one’s genetic makeup may constitute an underlying factor in many suicides. True, genes play a role in determining one’s temperament, and studies reveal that some family lines have more incidents of suicide than others. Yet, “a genetic predisposition to suicide by no means implies that suicide is inevitable,” says Jamison.
Brain chemistry too can be an underlying factor. In the brain billions of neurons communicate electrochemically. At the branched-out ends of the nerve fibers, there are small gaps called synapses across which neurotransmitters carry information chemically. The level of one neurotransmitter, serotonin, may be involved in a person’s biological vulnerability to suicide. The book Inside the Brain explains: “A low serotonin level . . . can dry up the wellsprings of life’s happiness, withering a person’s interest in his existence and increasing the risk of depression and suicide.”
The fact is, however, that nobody is destined to commit suicide. Millions of people cope with heartaches and stresses. It is the way the mind and the heart react to pressures that leads some to kill themselves. Not just the immediate triggering causes but the underlying factors must also be dealt with.
So, then, what can be done to create a more positive outlook that will regenerate a measure of zest for life?",1

"No matter how much we want our families to understand what we go through, they never will. The only people who have true empathy for us are our fellow survivors. I say survivors because we have to battle our brains on a daily basis, but we survive. Maybe we go through this to be able to help one another. I've been fighting this battle for over 40yrs.  My life is chaotic on the inside, but it's still a life worth living. Most people fear what they don't understand and will lash out. And we scare the hell out of them. All you can say to them is that ""this is what I need to do to live my life. Your approval is not needed but your help would be appreciated."" Seek out a support group as a place to vent your daily problems, feelings, fears, etc so you can see that you aren't alone in this. When we isolate ourselves and only use our family for support, it will amplify the pain. Suicide usually happens in a moment of helplessness and darkness. It sucks at that moment, but it will pass. Find something right now that you have a passion for. It can be anything that makes you feel happy and alive. If you need to loose yourself in books, movies, video games, searching the internet, hiking, listening to music, going out with a friend, etc, go for it. Just tell the illness that you need a break and delve into something you want to do. It's a part of you, but not the only part of you.  Just know that you were born this way because your soul is strong and can find your way. And all the people who commented are sending you support, acceptance of who you are and love for a fellow human being. We care about you and the pain you're in. We see you. You are not alone.",1

"Self harm does not generally mean that someone is hurting themself in order to kill themselves - people who self harm generally do as a copies mechanism to deal with distress, hurt. pain or to actually feel something. It doesn't mean they are at the point of suicide . These are things that can distract until the urge or compulsion to harm calms down. Rather than burn or cut yourself for instance and leave permanent damag or harm  it's to try and find something that does not cause permanent damage such as ice cubes drawing on arms with red paint or excercise etc.",1
"I know the struggle. Take care and please try to find people to surround yourself that are understanding, compassionate, and supportive.  Family relations are important but if they are unable to be there for you you may need to distance yourself to find what you need to be well. Take care.",1

Could also be a picture made by sanding through multiple layers of paint on a used car.

"I understand,I've been hospitalized 3 times for  same. Came out and started an out patient therapy and recovery center. It seemed tohelp. I learned new coping skills. I truly believe this is why I look back now and see why I struggled so much in school and my past mirrage",1
I've lost a lot of jobs due to my bipolar disorder and very bad horrible anixety. Right now I'm working one on one with  clients in a health care setting and I'm thriving. Even able to work overtime. Just have to find the right field of nursing for you. I know you'll be able to do it with the right combo of meds and some time.,1
"I'm right where you are, actually worse. I have nothing. No significant other, family is dying left and right, lost everything after working in the mental health field as well as with convicted felons on parole and being traumatized by 9 yrs of that, as well as bipolar, alcoholism, meds leading to paranoia, car wrecks leading to a broken back that brought on more trauma, more meds, more self abuse, more lost, if you ever find a way out, please share, cause i think i'm already dead and stranded in my own lonesome purgatory.",1
"I have these same diagnosis. Some days I can't even go into a crowded store, in fear of no way out I guess. I've just been working damn hard to cope. Therapy, every tool and can use I use it. CBT/DBT skills, journaling, some days fighting to breathe. Just know you can live a good, happy, fulfilled life if you work for it. I know that may not seem fair, just always try to find something to be grateful for, and know it can always be worse.",1
"Not an RN but LPN of 15 yrs and my last day of work was May 12th.of last year.

I too.loved my job but, I cant begin to imagine going back.to it yet,  if ever. I have since lost so much self confidence and self esteem. I truly know where your coming from.  I have so damned many diagnosis. I literally lost everything I had in Feb of this year and am currently living with a family member that don't understand my issues and is verbally mean... I pray to get out soon.. I will pray for you as well.",1
Thank you Cathy Allen and I have to retained a lawyer and unfortunately is not the best I could have got. Have been denied once and waiting for a decision now and am about 3 months in to that decision. Only makes me more anxious.,1
"I worked in non-clinical jobs for our local hospital for 23 years. I worked 2 years longer than my psychiatrist wanted me too. I am now seeking disability. I have bipolar disorder, PTSD, General Anxiety, and, on the physical side, fibromyalgia. I was out of work for about 8 months before I could really look back and see how stressed out I was. I believe I was close to a breakdown. I have my disability hearing in July after being out of work 2 and a half years.",1
I think you might need to try a less stressful environment with predictable patients and hours- could you work in an office?  Like a physician's office?  Or have you thought  of applying for disability?  It is not much money but after two years you get access to health care.,1
Even recovery  rooms  can be extremely  stressful. Some patients do not come out of anesthesia  well at all- having screaming and violent  episodes (through no fault of their own).,1
Those can be very stressful environment- do not suggest there.,1
"Take a step down from RN. Think of being a school nurse, less stressful.",1
Consider going that four hours. You're more valuable than your illnesses. It'll work for you. I've found in 60 years of depression/anxiety that the right doctor can make a HUGE difference!!! Do it!,1

"I agree with Susan Bates  I know what you mean about good days and bad days.  The bad days can be miserable if we allow them to.  Find more positive, supporting, friends, activities, hobbies.  Your family sounds very supportive, allow them to help you when you are overwhelmed.  You are not a burden to anyone.  God Bless.",1
"No you don't ruin every thing. That's you're depression and anxiety telling you that. Your family won't think that at all. They sound like they want to support you, so let them. They love you and want the best for you. It's very hard to see when you're not well. You are very lucky to have a caring family. Embrace it and take strength from it. When you're feeling a bit better have a think about it. Think how you'd react if it was a member of your family that had your illness. You'd probably want to be there for them. It's difficult to see whilst you're  ill. Fighting the demons suck to living life out of you and you're unable to think rationally. Like you said you feel on burden on everyone you know. But we're not. Take care. I hope you have a good period soon. Listen to your family then. X",1
"This is your damaged mind saying This, not the true you.  You want to live life and see your children grow, but the illness makes it difficult.  Try not to feel guilty or have shame over what your illness is doing to you.  Just keep living life and seek help if you can.  Surround yourself with a support network, and believe that one day you will pull through this dark cloud.",1
"I feel exactly the same. My son is 22 now now but I feel I've been a terrible mother and he deserved better. He's had so much to put up with from such a young age. He was 10 when I got diagnosed with rapid cycling bipolar. I talk to him about it, which is usually when I'm depressed and he always says I've been a fantastic Mam and that there's no need to worry about it. He said he had a really good up bringing and couldn't have been more loved. I've been a single mother from him being 6. Your children will probably say the same to you one day. We're good parents but just have more to deal with than other families x",1
"I constantly struggle with the fear that I will never be happy. I have a loving, caring, understanding wife and an amazing, intelligent, creative, and very loving four year old daughter. I should be strengthened by their presence in my life yet I still feel crippled by fear and doubt. I've been actively working on improving myself over the last six years and I feel like I've barely made it to where I should have been at 22-23. I'm 28 now. Being an extreme introvert and having an anxiety disorder, OCD, poor impulse control, and fibromyalgia makes it feel impossible to be my best and be happy. Financial insecurity is also a problem. Sorry if this was just an unhelpful rant. Basically I struggle with happiness, and have been told I don't know what joy is.",1
"I have been on medications, many, for depression , anxiety, bipolar:severe,mixed, insomnia, chronic pain and muscle spasms,etc.!

Try not to worry.  I am famous for being late on things.  I forgot to pay for my daughters field trip and felt like the worst parent in the world.  She still brings it up.  NO PARENT IS PERFECT!

"I been on all 4still on lithium but still not feeling well,I couldn't take Effexor gave me like little pulsation in  my head and latuda omg I was so restless like really awful,, really I think the lamictal worked best for me but everything works different for everyone",1
Managed to lose 2 st but extremely hard even with diet and exercise plus I  take 200mg of sertraline  and other meds it's a constant struggle,1
"I am on both hydroxyzine and seroquel. I don't really think the hydroxyzine helps with anxiety, it does make you sleepy. And I can't sleep if I don't have the seroquel. Hopes this helps.",1
"Hydroxyzine..it is not a strong drug but works for anxiety. Serequil is hard core and hard to get off. Hydroxyzine is also used for itching. Basically, it's a Benadryl on steroids.",1
Hydroxyzine calmed me but also put me to sleep. It was fast acting. The seroquel i just stored taking because it have me the worst restless legs I've ever experienced. But as they have all said its different for everybody.  All you can do is try it and find out.,1
God not seraquil. Also named quitepin. They hand them out in old people's home to keep them quiet. When u first take them u feel like u have. Been Brainwashed. Horrible nasty drug.,1
Seroquil scares me ... I stopped taking it because it was making me sleep walk.  Freaked me out.,1
"Hi, I have been on citalopram and sertraline for severe clinical depression in the past. Neither added to the quality of life and between them the side effects werent good. Recently I have been made reundant and also threatened with homelessness all within a month. My anxiety and depression is through the roof. My GP suggested I try an snri instead of the usual ssri. He put me on Venlaflaxine for both anxiety and depression. After 3 weeks I feel in a much better place and apart from a mild headache during the first week I have had no side effects at all and that includes in the area of your life that ssri's usually spoil   ",1
I have taken both. Seroquel caused me rapid excess weight gain (40 lb over 2 months). Vistaril (hydroxyzine) did not help with my anxiety,1
"I'm on Seroquel. Have been for almost 10 years. I love it. It's a mood stabilizer, and given for sleep. I'm on 600mg now, but find that I wake up feeling refreshed. Didn't like the extended release, because I felt like I had restless leg syndrome. But the regular release works awesome. Before Seroquel, I would stay awake for WEEKS with no sleep in sight.",1
"Hydroxyine (Vistaril) is an antihistamine  used to treat allergic reactions, nausea sickness and  tension and anxiety as it has sedative effect. Seroquel is an anti psychotic not an anti depressant and normally prescribed in addition to an anti depressant if person is suffering depression.",1
"Oops, didnt mean to send that yet. Hydroxyzine works with my minor anxiety but not much else. Good luck.",1
"I have taken Seraquel for years and it helped with my agitation, I take it at night and sleep good now that my anxiety is better. Before I took Trazdone for sleep, it works great but as my anxiety improved it would make me tired",1
Hydroxyzine works great for my panic attacks and calms down my anxiety.,1
Hydroxyzine is amazing for pain or if you're going through withdrawals from drugs or coming down from drugs and seroquil worked for maybe 2 weeks for me. I took it for sleep. But then I started getting restless leg syndrome and muscle spasms. Would be up all night. You also gain a lot of weight on seroquil so be careful!,1
"I'm in between medications. I accepted my diagnosis in 2014. When you see the worry in the faces of the people who love you, you realize that there's a problem. I have Bipolar I, Borderline, Social Anxiety, PTSD, and Generalized Anxiety disorder. I don't want to see that look of worry and panic in their faces again. It's nice to silence the noise in your head. I've probably battled all my diagnosis since I was 10. I can remember acting out of anger and frustration for so many years. Now that I lived with them for 27 years, I'm still here. I've learned to find artistic outlets to keep my mind busy. I will always have that struggle, but it's up to me if I want to go back down that dark road again. I choose not to let my mental illnesses take over my life. I'm lucky that I have an accepting family and a wonderful husband. It doesn't matter how others feel about me. As long as I have my family in my corner, I can face anything. I know this sounds hokey, but it's true. I want to defy the odds. So many therapists list that I can't do this or that. I want to prove them wrong. It takes a lot of time to realize it isn't really you, it's just your brain is on a different wavelength than so called ""normal"" people. But who is really normal anyway?",1
"Vitamin d is helpful for mood function and niacin is also supposed to be a great supplement as well. Fish oil and a regular diet help too!

Talk to your kid. Do they know if his parents are supportuve types and hes hust afraid they wont accept him for being gay? Or are they assholes? If he isnt already being ostracized by hus parents for everything. Go to them. Dont say anything about gay but let them know you are concerned about his cutting.,1
Could your daughter maybe invite him for a sleepover giving you chance to talk to him and get help? I imagine if he's gay and afraid to tell his parents that he's feeling very alone and could make a huge difference to know he does have support and people that care x,1
I totally agree. His parents need to be told. You aren't the child's guardian. If something does happen you may be at risk of blame which could mean a trip to the courts.,1
"You always have someone ... even though you won't feel like it.  A boy is a boy ... boys are dumb and never know a good thing before its too late     Don't be sad ... it just means he wasn't the right one.  You don't need anyone.  You have the love within you to be all you need.  All you need to do is bathe in the glory that is you everyday.

Im glad he did because several months later my now husband started to chat to me.  Yes life is a fight, and you will struggle. But you are not alone and there are amazingly good things and amazing people who are waiting for you. So hang in there and fight because in the end it will be worth it.",1
I suggest vipasanna meditation also known as mindfulness meditation for the reduction of anxiousness. Look up some scientific papers on the subject. It works for me.,1
"I'm an alcoholic which makes treatment extremely hard. I am diligent with my meds but it is very hard. Stay sober and take meds that don't seem to get me stable or drink that seems to make things ok. I made the choice (horrible) to do my meds and it's working. Not saying I don't want a drink but the benefits of just meds has helped me tremendously. Got a job, did well, got a car too. I'm doing better but the drugs are harder to fight. I wish I could help.   ",1
"It does take time to find the ""Right"" therapist for you. You have to be able to trust that person and be able to build a repore, a relationship between the two of you. Sometimes it takes a while to find that right one. 
There is patient/therapist confidentiality. If you did anything to this guy, stopping short of a felony, you shouldn't have to worry about it. 
I found it very helpful to write down my story.  Pour your mind and heart out on sheets of paper. Read it. Feel it. Know that it is you on those pages. 
Holding all your anxiety bottled up will do nothing but eat you from the inside out. As it is now. 
It's OK to see a therapist once or twice and decide if you are comfortable or not. They will not take it personally. It took me several years to find the right therapist who had the right modalities and approach to really set me free from my issues. 
It may take you some time to find the best fit, but DON'T GIVE UP!!",1
"Ive tried all the write it down and burn it bullshit. I hid it for years and functioned for somewhere around 10.yrs or so un til something else happened in my life. All that happened was a fing diagnosis of PTSD, even more meds and extensive therapy, and the thoughts of death on tbe daily. PLEASE, just go to therapy NOW, get it out and move on with your life while your young. Don't end up.like me, basically living in a 10x12 bedroom coming out only to exercise your dog and go to doctors appts. Live a good life and don't end up with social anxiety because of some asshole from the past...",1
i think you suffering from guilt and years of keeping a secret to yourself... i know exactly what you going through... till this day i have not opened up.. not even to my therapist.  am also in my 30s and everyday is a trying day... its so difficult to exist.  all the best today,1
"It took me awhile before I met people that I trusted with some of the horrible abusive stuff ive dealt with. My main issue is I don't like being looked at with pity when i need support. You've taken the first step by mentioning some things here over time I find it becomes easier.  I've forgiven those who hurt me, realized it made me who i am... I still deal with feelings of self hate but talking about some of what happened to people that are struggling like yourself is easier.... We are all hurting in some way the best way to move forward is let it go by crying, writing about it, typing it in groups like this.... It's not a sign of shame or weakness but strength.",1
"You will only deal with this when you are ready to, not before then. The only way around the anxiety is head on into it. The decision needs to be made as to which is going to hurt you worse, talking about it and being brutally honest with yourself and your counselor or letting it continue to eat you up inside. Who cares what the counselor thinks about it personally, you are paying them for their professional advice. But it helps to find someone you feel comfortable with. In the end you have nothing to lose by talking about it. You are the one causing the anxiety to yourself, not the event. Memories only have the power that you give them and truly can't hurt you. Take a leap of faith. I had to and my life is so much better for it. You can do it.",1
It can take a while to learn to trust a counsellor. What I found helpful was writing everything down and taking it to my sessions. I have it to him to read. And he would pull things out for us to talk about. It seemed easier that way. They are there to help us so there has to be some give and take. Oh and have you tried mindfulness for anxiety? There are plenty of resources on line plus apps for your phone. It teaches you to focus your energy on anything but the anxious feeling. Look it up. It has been s godsend for me. Take care.,1
"I went through a trauma in 2011 and had to wait months before I could actually admit that something was wrong and then open up to mental health professionals about what happened. I haven't told anyone other than my current mental health nurse exactly what happened to the full extent - and it still haunts me even though I've been through EMDR for PTSD - but I have convinced myself over several years to be more open about how I'm feeling and how things are affecting me. If you can, find a good therapist or mental health nurse you trust and try to open up to them, even if it's just a little bit at a time. It's important to get things off your chest so you don't hold on to all that stress and cause horrible damage to yourself like stomach ulcers and cysts.",1
"I have a number of mental health issues, sever ones. Ones I'm not willing to admit publicly but I will say they impact my life greatly and the relationships I have. I have sever anxiety amongst them, how do I cope? Truth is, sometimes I can't. But I have a beautiful little boy, who's face lights up the moment he sees me and runs into my arms. Who says daddy 300 times an afternoon just because I have him that day, just because his with me. I live for that, I fight all my problems for that. I use my little one as my grounding source, whenever I get too bad, I think if him or look through my pictures of him. Remind myself life isn't all bad, they're are little things that make it all worth while. My son is mine, what is yours?",1
"All that anxiety you are holding inside of you is a result of you not talking to someone. Let it out (to a reputable therapist) cry, don't hold it in. It's better than any medication. Trust me.",1

"I took it and it made my hypomania worse.    I was evil. 
I've had sleep paralysis in the past and it's terrifying.",1
"You can always call a distress line, mental health or even go to an ER.",1
"Hi, yes I have experienced the sleep paralysis on this drug. It lasted about 2/3 month's on & off. The event's are so real, you would swear on the oath that these event's you where feeling or hearing are real, the realness is unbelievabley real, & increased in severity, to the point that I was worried about going to sleep. Then all of a sudden they stopped & I haven't had an episode for about 4 month's now. But when they are happening, it was one off the scariest thing's I have ever gone through.",1
I have been on it for years and same dosage as well and never experienced those symptoms.  I am sorry you went through thay.  So scary on do many different levels.  Praying for you,1
I recently started taking this and on several occasions had nightmares...i haven't had then since i was a kid so very scary.,1
I've been on Lamictal and never experienced side effects that extreme/terrifying. You def need to get back in with your doc and possibly try another mood stabilizer....,1
Don't be afraid. The demons aren't real. Its just your brain misfiring..,1
"I'm on 100mg Lamictal twice a day and really took my time building up to 100mg from 25mg. My side effects are similar I do tend to ""hear"" things (not voices) and even with my fan going I still ""hear"" things. I do get paranoid and sometimes I have to get up to look around just for my sanitys sake. I also experience something that I can only describe as ""evil"" and feel like I'm being watched in my sleep as well as in my dreams. I always wake up freaked out and I have to go get out of bed and read a book to help me calm down.",1
Wish you good health and peace . Those were some distressing symptoms .,1
Taylor Beebe IM SORRY i suffer as well i guess im in between manic and depression. been diagnosed bi polor im so sorry.HVE TOOK MANY OF THEIR DRUGS AND IM ON NOTHING AT THIS TIME MY INSIDES ARE SHAKING WHEN IM NOT SLEEPING. AS IVE HAD TO DO WITHOUT MEDS FOR 17 DAYS IM TIRED IM SO SORRY.,1
"I don't take Lamictal but experience those symptoms way too often. Mine is a case of hypnogogic hallucinations, hypnopompic hallucinations & sleep paralysis.  It's very scary to experience but is a result of how my body falls asleep and wakes, and is not related to any psychosis. This may be what is happening with you too. Glad you got ahold of the other doctor though. I hope the Seraquel helps.",1
I've been on Seroquel for almost 10 years. And I love it. But the extended release are for the birds. Makes me feel like I have restless leg syndrome,1
I take 2 mg Klonopin and 150 mg of seroquel at bed time and it's lights out no side affects but do need to be woken up don't even hear the alarm prior to starting seroquel I would spend days awake then finally go to sleep for like 30 hours so it's working for me,1
When I took lamictal and trazodone together I would have terrifying dreams within dreams about being attacked in the middle of the night. I never knew when I was awake or asleep,1
"Same thing happened to me. 2 weeks into taking this med I was having horrible hallucinations at night and weird dreams. Then shortly after I developed a full body rash. I didn't know the rash was connected to the medication at first and was misdiagnosed at the first urgent care visit as just having a basic rash. later found out I was allergic to the medication and spent a week in the hospital with Liver Failure, my enzyme levels were in the 500's.",1
Yeah I was warned that there's chances of a life threatening rash. Luckily that didn't happen to me.,1
"I think it sounds like you had a sleep paralysis side effect and then you had an anxiety attack because of it. When you are panicking you can experience lots of weird sounds, feelings and ideas.",1
holy wow that is seriously scary. I've experienced sleep paralysis once but nothing on the level you have and I still have major insomnia problems.,1
"I've been wobbling a lot lately but didn't want to admit it, felt guilty for feeling low when I have so many good things in my life but it spun into a vicious circle. I've got help though so I've broken the circle now.",1
Without a doubt a dog is definitely a best friend. My daft old mutt sensed me having  a particularly dark and grim episode and she got up off her bed to come and lie next to my chair while continually looking up at me like she was reassuring me that she was there for me.  This may sound stupid to some but I for one believe that dogs can sense owners mood and wellbeing,1
"Yeah I had a look last night, such a shame when so many people would benefit greatly from it.",1
"Will be your hero tomorrow as well. My baby boy feels what i feel. Then i feel so guilty.
Then i assure him that mums okay and he can go back being a dog. My baby is Oscar.....your babys name is........?",1
Cats are very intuitive also. Mine stays with me when stressed or depressed. She is a rock.,1
My boy is the same when I have panic attacks. I couldn't be without him,1
Don't know why you think this is weird to be honest. Obviously it is going to be hard for her seeing her ex and you together it would be unusual if it didn't make her feel awkward. Howerver it is really her issue and only she can move forward and accept things. You dont say  how long ago they were together - I'm presuming they had split before you and he got together. As long as your cousin is not deliberately making things difficult for you both I would just carry on as normal. That's really all you can do.,1
"Me myself the self journal helps alot.. this works on my spin downs... keeping busy with even small projects keeps MY mind contrasted off life's course,mind games seem to work when I'm hipper inside I'm just learning this.. candy crush ,works .. also I have been doing a lot of research on different ways of help... I am on medications and in therapy of 14 yrs now so,I could go on and on... anxiety with burst of energy can be used wisely..... your in the right dirrection,MOST wait to LONG to ask for advice.. good luck.. you got this  ",1
Lithium is HORRIBLE. I hope it isn't as bad for you as it was me!!! Only good thing is i felt normal well as normal as I can after I got off. That was a terrible medication experencr for me,1
It's horrible out h get with insurance.  Lose your job lose insurance.  They just passed a bill where anyone with pre existing condition is denied insurance through government our it's so expensive we can't afford it.  I'm just praying,1
Lexapro (escitalopram) has helped me tremendously with both my dpression and anxiety. I take 20 mg,1
Lexapro worked for me for 10 years and I think the only reason it stopped working was because my life became more stressdul7,1
"Struggling to, it's been a long time...",1
I hear you honey X struggling myself ☹️,1

Still feel guilty sometimes",1
I'm going to try and get him to meet with me as well we I'm south Africa if u not on health insurance the waiting list to see any doc is so long I'm afraid it might be too late I myself am bipolar and attempted suicide for times the fourth I pray was my last,1
Take him in for awhile . If he afraid that his parents won't love him become the parent he needs . Try to talk to him and communicate if it's really horrible call 911 n get him help .,1
"I've been on numerous medications also- idk specifics about you of course area, dr, insurance etc but I had a genetic test done - paid for by insurance thankfully and turns out my ""body type"" can only respond to 4 types of medication none of which I had tried- currently in trying the third one on the list- and it helps for the most part- the test also told me about interactions with sleeping medication and how actually my body works  against them. I don't know much about lithium but I know it's an option to avoid - anyways genetics testing Might be an option for you- good luck -",1
I've been indoors over a year due to people and terrible anxiety. I'd rather someone throw a net over me and drag me out of here.    ,1
I'm from Australia and get free or heavily subsidised Drs and subsidised medication. I just can't believe that in this day and age in a 1st world country a person has to worry about withdrawals due to not being able to afford meds. It infuriates me. I'm so sorry this has happened.,1
"If your withdrawing off all of these at the same time them you are going to be in for a hard time.
Its not going to be pleasant and that is speaking from experience.
I would recommend withdrawing in a facility where you can be monitored. As i have Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, OCD, Bipolar 1, Boardline personality disorder, eatly onset psychosis, as well as chronic pain, Fibromyalgia.
And ive done the withdrawl process in order to change meds and when i wanted to have my son.
But in all honesty its not going to be pretty. Please dont do it alone.",1
"I lost health insurance recently too and it took calling around to 10 different pharmacies to find pricing to where it was manageable for my 3 meds without insurance. I've done cold turkey off my meds before and I don't recommend doing it. I was stupid and angry at the world and manic at the time and didn't care until withdrawal came.

When it comes to your meds I would suggest that you see if you can get samples of seroquel if they still do them. Keep the Lamictal and Prozac if you can. Call around to different pharmacies and do a price comparison. My doctor stressed in my situation Lamictal was important to stay on.",1
"As many have stated, take a deep breath. Pharmacies can get you in touch with companies that will either get you samples or coupons for discounts. If you have a Costco in your area, they have the best discount program and good prices. 

But check with your state Mental Health website. It should give you links to the counties where you can get free care. It will take time to qualify for the ACA your area. Or any state benefits. 

I have been where you are. I have slogged through the system and know what to do. After 39 years of trial and error,  it can be very frightening. But DO NOT go off your meds!! 

PM me and I would me happy to walk you through what needs to be done. Hang in there!!",1
I refuse to get started on therapy to lose it suddenly. Its a real threat to not have the coverage! There are ways to manage.,1
"Call the drug companies, they quite often have a plan that will work for you, if nothing else they will reduce the cost of your meds. Then go to the State and stay there until someone listens to you!!! Withdrawals are horrible and if it gets too bad head for the ER, their social workers usually have someone or something that will work for you. God bless my friend, I'll be thinking of you.......",1
You need to find somewhere that you can detox safely especially from the Klonopin I had a doctor abruptly take me off Klonopin did not tell me that I could suffer seizures that could possibly kill me from this withdrawal and the withdrawal was absolutely horrible from what I understand the type of medication is one of the worst withdrawals almost,1
"Seroquel is going to be.... difficult. For me, I had withdrawl symptoms for a couple of months. I had horrible itching and had to take benedryl to take care of it. Klonopin, you might be moody for awhile. I don't recall withdrawl symptoms off of Lamictal. Same with Prozac, I don't recall because I was on that too many years ago, but I remember I didn't tirate off of it. I'm sorry you are having to face going off of your medications. That just really stinks.",1
"I have depression, severe anxiety, PTSD and major OCD I haven't taken any pills in over 10yrs. And cannabis helps me :)",1
You might struggle to sleep,1
Yeah I just came off lyrica and sereque l don't want to scare u but it was horrible. U can't not take your meds u must see your Dr they can bulk bill u and the chemist can set up an account for u just tell them your circumstances. If not go to hospital maybe there is a social worker u could see. If u go down hill u have to be treated good luck Hun,1
I'm on olanzapine was 30mg now 10 as well as lithium and mirtazapine. All 3 can cause weight gain. I've managed to put a halt and starting to lose some weight 34kg by replacing breakfast and lunch with a diet shake and only carbs 2 nights a week otherwise protein and veg or salad. It's tough and boring and yes I do cheat occasionally but it's all worth it because this is the first time I have felt like I'm in control of my moods and anxiety.,1
"I don't know of anyone who has used it either however the psychiatrist I work with has seen it quickly bring patients out of very deep depressions. From my understanding, you do not run the risk of permanent memory loss with it either, as seen in Electroconvulsive Therapy, another treatment option for resistant bipolar.",1
"I suffer from Bi-polar 1. I keep a written list of 101 things I love. When I'm depressed I look at it and try to do one or two things, like have a cup of tea, or light a candle, play with the dog. It doesn't make the depression disappear, but for several minutes I'm engaged in something else besides my own mental and emotional misery.",1

"It took me 15 years to even start to come to grips with my illnesses (bi polar social anxiety disorder ptsd and agoraphobia)...
... For ur case i hope u can learn to cope and come to grips sooner rather than later. U have a proven medical condition imbalance in ur brain and its nothing to be ashamed of. I was ashamed for 15 years. Still am. But i am making progress.
As for meds i just always accepted i will be medicated the rest of my life. Never really had to fight with it cuz i know what im like off them and its not pretty.
Good luck",1
"Bipolar Disorder is a chronic illness & is not curable. There will be times in your life where it's well managed & there will be times where it's unstable. Like any other chronic illness, you need to learn about it; you need to know what may trigger an episode & also the things that help to make it easier to live with. [For me] I found group therapy and peer support helped me to realise I wasn't the only one living with BPD and then to accept that to live my best life I had to take some responsibility for staying well. It was my job to:
☆Nourish my body with quality food
☆Take medication
☆Exercise regularly 
☆Get enough sunlight
There will be times I can do all of these things & times where I find them a challenge. Having at least ONE person who truly 'gets' your illness is imperative; you need to be able to vent & unload when you're struggling & also have someone to prompt you to reach out if you're not coping. Give yourself time to get your head around it all - Mental Illness is not for the faint-hearted. You will discover you are stronger than you think you are. Blessings.  ",1
Check your vitamin levels!! Vitamin B12 turned my life around!! A deficiency in B12 can lead to depression and Mania. Tablets are available but I get injections because some people don't absorb it properly.  Vitamin D has greatly helped my irritability as well,1
"Yes to so many of these ideas. Practicing mindfulness everyday, even when I don't have a panic attack, lowers the number of days I have panic attacks overall. Support animals have been a lifesaver for me. Writing in a journal. Even things like writing what I'm upset about onto construction paper using a map pencil and then tearing it up gets some of the energy of it out - an actual physical expression. Walking, yoga, or even just stretching and progressive relaxation all help me. You can find guided meditations for free on you tube or podcasts. And yes, deep breathing, too, and other grounding techniques. Oh! And yes, supplements-wise valerian root and 5-HTP are good. 5HTP is basically tryptophan- the chemical from the turkey that makes everyone want to nap after Thanksgiving dinner. Chamomile tea can be relaxing, and the essential oils lavender and cedar wood are both known to promote relaxation/sleep.",1
"I have BP2, MDD, and general anxiety. I don't take meds for the anxiety because I don't like the feeling. I use breathing teqniques, meditation, listen to music (like when I'm on the bus), and some yoga to keep things under control. My therapist also has recomended tapping and body relaxation, though I haven't tried it.",1
"Breathing exercises. When you become overwhelmed with anxiety your breathing can become more rapid and if you can control it/slow it you will find yourself calming down some.
Practice visualization to help fool your brain when you become overwhelmed with a situation. Example: Anxious on public transportation while going to work you visualise yourself where ever you feel calm and with practice you can maintain that image easier.",1
It's  really hard  and u r very Brave I have to struggle everyday to get out of a house oh sweet I lot because of my anxieties so I do feel sorry for you just keep on battling all the best to you,1
Weed can make anxiety worse and bring on panic attacks. Go to your g.p. and TELL them (dont ask) that you wish to be referred to the mental health and you then get medicated. Good luck and take care.,1
"Put yourself in the middle of good people and let them show you they care.  If no-one does, then stop worrying and start learning you. Accept you and try to be happier",1
"I do breathing exercises, grounding exercises. I am a Rockhound so I take long walks looking for artifacts fossils etc. Anything to distract my brain from the anxiety.....",1
"I think I get anxiety a lot when I'm overwhelmed then feel worthless when I get nothing done because I'm so in my head. I think it would help to schedule out your day & go crazy on simple ""to do"" lists. That way you can take your day one step at a time & feel good about the things you get done. Hope that helps",1
"This gonna really sound crazy to some but an Adult Coloring book and listening to your favorite music. It helps me. Totally takes me out of the situation. However, I am nedicated and still have extreme anxiety at times. My dog also helos, walking or plaing with her. Just find so.ething to keep you busy.",1
I have bipolar I and anxiety which doesn't respond to meds. I was introduced to mindfulness and I've never looked back. Look it up on the internet and there are also apps for your phone. It's a way of refocusing your thoughts. Of course if you can get to a psychologist/therapist then that would be great but try mindfulness. It has been a godsend.,1
"yes, animals help a great deal. there is a product called valerian root, you can get it at pharmacies and at GNC. helped me some. maybe it would help you. also try to talk about your feelings with others and try to start a journal. hope you get to feeling better soon. anxiety is horrific but it can be managed. good luck and take care.",1
"I know someone is going to blast me for this but I started the keto diet sometime back. My xanax use has dwindled. I'm not saying this has solved my anxiety problems by any means, but it has definitely helped a lot.",1
"My dog helps a lot, he's not a registered support animal or anything but he definitely helps. I've also found some of the most random things that help like listening to an audiobook of Harry Potter helps, or I found out that fantastic beasts audiobook really helped because for whatever reason the tone of Eddie redmaynes voice is incredibly calming to me (who knew that would be a thing ha.) but in all seriousness, animals are the best for anxiety.",1
If you can I think some form of exercise would take the edge off the anxiety and relieve some depression.,1
"I wish I could help but I was wondering how I can be able to cope, lost everything because of my bipolar disorder.now I'm just struggling to get through everything each day I'm tired of fighting, not sure if I can fight another day, not sure if I want to",1
I exactly have this. Sometimes going outside even for 5mins helps. Or fun music while I do a small task like unload dishwasher. Also I don't set expectations for myself at these times because if I can't do them I'll feel guilty in addition to what I'm already feeling!!!!! Try tell myself that it'll pass and it gets better.,1

"Candice Alexis my Aunt has also had this treatment and her memory has been blown. She can't drive because she forgets what the colors of lights mean, stop, go and caution. It's incredibly scary and she is not even close to the same person with or without depression. Hang in there! It took years and years of med trial and error. I feel OK with the meds I'm taking now but I hoped for more improvement. I guess push forward an keep on keeping on!",1
"Is ECT eclectic therapy? What do u know about it, I have severe depression , anxiety , PTSD, BPD , bipolar , im starting to get (agoraphobia?) I can barely leave my house without a panic attack, I'm not taking meds atm (I have before but none ever worked, so I thought I'd try more natural methods, didn't work and waiting on a referral to try new meds again) I had an aunt get the electric stuff done (I always called it electro shock but it's not called that anymore, not sure what exactly it's called) but anyway my aunt had bad mental health as well and they suggested it so she tried it... She's never been the same, she can't remember her phone number or bank info n PIN numbers , she has bad memory loss and is often delusional about people's intentions, she's extremely paranoid and has very bad self care , this turned me off to the whole treatment and I can't understand why it's still used, is that not the usual reaction ? I'd like to know some more information if possible",1
"Gabapentin has a withdrawal syndrome associated with it. Though it is denied by the medical community. People are sufferings alone without the support of their medical providers all the time. The symptoms we suffer are only recognized to happen if they are abusing their medicine. I am here to tell you that people taking their medication as directed are suffering horrible withdrawals. The clinical trials headed by Dr. Scott Rueben for Gabapentin/Lyrica and 21 pain meds in total was proven in a court of law falsified data and he was sent to prison. However, his data is still what the FDA and the medical community uses as a trusted source. Suicidal idealization , extreme anxiety, Akathisia, seizures and more.

"I'm sorry to hear of your husbands condition. Any med change can be scary.  I also take gabapentin, 300 mg 3 times per day when needed for anxiety. If you live in a medical state, why not consider mmj. It could be a quick alternative until he can be seen by a doctor. They are using it for ptsd. Just my 2 cents.",1
Usually used for restless leg not mental issues. VA is notorious for mismanagement of mental health issues.,1
He might have wothdrawal like symptoms because his anxiety is rising over the lack of med and upset caused by the doctors lack of care. Seek out a new doctor if possible. And report this one.,1
It is I was on it for bipolar depression and anxiety. It didn't work for me.,1
"Unfortunately, I have not heard much positives about Veteran hospitals and Doctor's. I'm sorry you're going through so much. I'm sure it's overwhelming for you and the family. Escalate, escalate and escalate for a refill and/or an explanation of the prescribed dosage. Be clear and let them know they made a ""MISTAKE""! Ask for a Director who the Dr reports to and update the Dr of your actions. They usually hear "" mistake"" and respond. Your Husband should not have to suffer through this. Also, he might want to contact he general practitioner to inform of situation. I wish you luck and a quick resolution. I've been in the same situation.",1

"I think that you are really going to have to be straight with yourself!!! Sounds like you are in self destruct mode. You want so desperately to feel better but then on the other side you do not love yourself or even care if if you live or die. You are being pulled in both directions, thats such a hard position to be in sweetheart. You have to make a pact with yourself!!! You must be compliant with your medication!! What do you have to loose? Be honest with your doctor and tell he/she about your non compliance ans see  what suggestions they can recommend.  Do you live with someone that can ensure they can take responsibility for them to dispense , watch you take them and monitor your compliance?  PleAse try and stick to it, have faith in yourself, its only up to you to make the right choice! Live or die ?? You get one chance at life, i know it can suck, im in that place right now myself, but there are also so many opportunities also to experience joy, love, happinesss and peace...... dont waste your only chance at the gift of life :) i know it can be shit and it can also be a wonderful experience too. Only you can create your own future xxx good luck beautiful girl!",1
"CBT has never helped me. I have had more positive results from CT/RT or EMDR therapy. CBT is more or less a ""one size fits all"" type therapy and is only effective for anxiety and depression (even though it did not help me very much) Explore some other therapies and find which one will benefit and address your most prominent mental issues before committing to a therapy.",1
There's a nootropic you can buy inexpensively online called phenibut. It affects your GABA receptors like benzodiazepines do. When I take it my anxiety is gone and I sleep really well.,1
"I cannot move if I don't take my meds, I'm so scared I go completely off my rocket. I'm too scared to try and not take them, and believe me I drink alot. Im also diabetic so injections as well .",1
If my anxiety isn't really bad I use a decider with essential oils and just lay on the bed and try to relax. But if my anxiety is really bad I can't keep still and find it very hard to sleep or relax. I've no advise on when it's really bad because I've yet to find one x,1
"If you have a good friend or family member ask them to sort an appointment for you, medication was the only thing in the end, I am bipolar, general anxiety disorder, social phobia, stress.  How I coped initially was by training in Cognitive behavioral therapy on a distance learning course.  This showed me techniques to stop over thinking and how to handle dysfunctional thoughts.  You can probably go on to you tube and google a session of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety.  The other thing I used a lot again found on you tube was guided meditation for anxiety or you can get a quick one for panic attacks, etc.  Although these coping methods got me through for years, I am just the happiest most balanced I have ever been since being on medication.  I still meditate and use coping techniques and I do battle daily just on a lesser scale enabling me to enjoy.  I am not so quick as I was before but thats okay.  Good luck you can do it.  One vital thing also before I go is learn to breathe properly.  Hugs xx",1
Getting into a routine of exercise and weight training is extremely helpful. No one around here prescribes actual anxiety medication anymore.,1
"I have BP level II as well. My wife keeps telling me to get out and try to exercise (of course with no luck since depression and stress tell me to just stay inside) To be honest, the only advice I can give is: don't do anything (if possible) that could cause you to go into a mania (since manias lead to depression at least for me) and try to avoid any stimulant such as caffeine. Are you in school? I know for me my online classes really cause me a ton of stress even though I make a mountain out of an ant hill. Oh and maybe you should try to find a self help website such as mood gym.",1
"I cope with medication, clonezapam. I have bi-polar2, OCD, Generalized Anxiety. 
To be honest, I'm not sure how I could/would be able to cope. I have been on meds since 2009",1
Medication is part of the answer especially with anxiety / depression. Therapy/counselling/CBT/DBT are also important to explore underlying issues/thought processes.,1
I actually wear a Amber anklet which I find helps with my anxiety especially whilst driving try it,1
"Am i the only one Who is Bipolar, has Depression, and Anxiety but takes no Medicines? and is surviving on my own? alone?",1
"Hear hear..... Well done Kit. I do think that our recovery begins with us, if I'd left it to the doctors I'd still be in a bad place, but by changing my gp (to one who understands ( Bipolar & BPD) and discussing my care plan, getting myself back on track, with her help and advice, I really dread to think where I'd be now. It's not easy and I do have good/bad days/weeks but I know if I'm in trouble, I only have to pick up the phone, to my gp, the local mental health helpline, or any of my very good friends and someone will help me.. I'm blessed xx",1
Keeping you in my prayers. Go to the ER if you need to. My depression and anxiety got better once I got rid of my cheater.,1
"Its hard to think ""future"" when you're in a dark place. Almost impossible, I've been there many times!!! Call your Doctor immediately and see if you can get in ASAP. Do you have a support system?  If so use them and let them know where you're at mentally. I have very little support, but the few I have, I turn to. Unfortunately, if their not in your shoes they don't completely understand the impact our negative self-talk has on our ability to cope. The little challenges are huge to tackle when you're depressed. You're going through some pretty ""life changing"" problems, which only quadruples the situation!  I've been there and no amount of ""positive"" thinking can bring you out of this, from my experience. Get help, even if it's calling a suicide hotline!   You're at the beginning of this roller coaster ride and it will and does get better. It takes time and education about our disorder. I have two children and have seriously attempted suicide three times. I panic at thought, if I had succeeded, where and what damage I could have caused to my children. I also went through some major issues during my ""dark place"", death, divorce and a custody battle. I ended up in the hospital where my battle and journey with depression/bipolar began. Its a positive thing that you were even able to reach out to this group. In the past, I couldn't and didn't. Please, please help yourself and get help, now! Your in control of how you're story ends.........get help, its out there. Trust me!",1
"Hello, I am also in the U.K. And have been through what you're going through... Except mine went misdiagnosed for a good 14 years - if not from birth (I'm now 28), after being diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and depression up until August 2016, when I'd attempted suicide 3 times and I'd run up £10k in debt in 6 months... They home treatment/crisis team's psych decided I had EUPD and put me on quetiapine which I reacted badly to (although they're not a quick fix and I probably needed longer) - I was then discharged back into the care of my GP and referred to a psych outpatients for early access... who changed my meds to carbamazepine and added in fluoxetine and I ended up in A&E again with total depersonalisation for a few hours and uncontrollable crying... after a strongly worded letter and a move of NHS trusts, I'm finally on Depakote, fluoxetine, lorazepam and zopiclone... I'm still not stable but it's only been 2 months. I find exercise really helps me, but totally understand that you probably aren't in control of managing a schedule (as I'm not most days)...

"I'm fed up of feeling tired all the time, even if I've had a good night's sleep. I've begged my Dr for medication again but she says there is nothing that works with eupd, yet I keep seeing everyone mention medication on these chat pages. I miss being happy, I've lost interest in all my hobbies and have to force myself to tend to put ponies everyday, I can't sell them as they do help me when I'm out there (plus my kids would kill me). Even my episodes are no longer a high where I'm bouncing around everywhere, I cry, scream, rock, smash up things and self harm to ease the tension. The episodes are not as often but when they happen they are a lot worse to the point I scare myself. I find it hard to talk to friends, famy even my husband so bloke it all up inside. I've spoken to my mum before and she ended up crying which made me feel bad as if upset her, she cried because she was shocked by what I was saying happens to me. So I won't talk to anyone now. I issolate myself. I wake up every morning and hate that I've woken up. I feel low all the time.",1
i suff to do i get the racing thoughts and can't sleep I am in my room for the only time i feel about getting back to do something that i want to do i don't get the chance to talk about it with anyone they're all too busy to talk about it and make a big deal out of it now I'm going to be going to the hospital and I will be there for awhile my brother call the cops and they are talking about it now I'm just trying to help myself and my mom is getting worried about this small problem because of my brother call the cops and tells them I've been up since he had to talk about it when I'm not been sleeping so I am in touch with my life and I am okay well it's noting that I'm not able too fix myself so don't worry about it when you have a hard time with the mood or behavior changes in a manic depression that you are having it feels like hell and you are able to see a doctor go see what happens if you take medicine,1
It took me a long time to sleep last night      it was my anxiety     ,1

A strong man and a believer of Christ never fear anyone. He always rise when he fall.,1
"I would add, that there are things that might help some of you like:
-holding an ice-pack to your face (a friend of mine tried this and was really surprised it calmed him down)
-try 4/8 breathing (in through your nose for a count of 4, out through the mouth on a count of 8), which is really hard, I know, but if you succeed, I think it is impossible to remain in a fight/flight mode. Humming might work for the same reasons, since it is only possible to hum while breathing out
-remind yourself that in a way you are causing this panic and so you can stop it. you are in control. (I do not me you do this actively, like ""oh, let's have a panic attack"", please do not get me wrong there)",1
I hate the fact that I know some of my triggers but can't avoid them...l have to just keep up the exposure as I've been told this is better than isolating myself in fear,1
Last time I had a massive panic attack there was nothing around me to cause it. My husband and I were watching Disney movies on the couch and I was browsing pintrest for diabetic friendly recipes for dinner with my grandparents. It was a nice quiet night. The panic attack slammed into for no reason. My husband was sound asleep at the time but I'm sure he heard the panic in my voice all I said was his name not even loud just normal volume which usually he wakes up for nothing. I could tap dance on his head and he wouldn't wake up. But he heard me say his name was instantly awake and getting up. I said I needed him to hold me and instantly he was next to me holding me tight while I clung to him. Didn't say a word til I started to let go of the death grip I had on his shirt which meant I was starting to calm down. And then all he asked was what caused it. I'm grateful he will always help me and I can calm down just with him holding me.,1
Shakir,1
I had an anxiety attack today and not all of those work,1
"This is contingent on what the the trigger of the panic attack is IF there is one. If the source of anxiety is caused by an exisiting phobia, there is an establishd and ingrained pattern that is very hard to turn around on the spot without medication. I would say, just don't diminish the persons concerns and hang in there till it's over.",1
I battle depression and anxiety a day bipolar. I have my good days and I have my bad days. It's hard to battle mental disorders,1
I to suffer from manic depression & anxiety.  Please keep passing this around,1
"Idk if anyone else has mentioned this but I stress to everyone if it's urgent go to the hospital and there also hospital programs that are outpatient programs in certain places, it's not just inpatient that is offered. So look up the closest mental hospital. Also, in those that are Bipolar antidepressants can cause mania and fluoxetine is one. Also, it has been shown to cause rapid cycling in bipolar patients. It also may affect adversely the development of the brain in young people. As far as the hallucinations, psychosis can be part of bipolar but not bipolar 2.",1
"She is experiencing psychosis. Let her dr know that you are in an emergency situation & that she is hallucinating & showing signs of psychosis. 
I had an episode of psychosis about 10 years back. Had hallucinations for the first time. It was the scariest thing I have experienced. Unfortunately I was told (& turned out to be true for me) that once a person experiences hallucinations. When in times of extreme stress, anxiety, etc. I start having mild hallucinations. At least now I can usually tell what is a hallucination & what is real. I smell smoke sometimes. I've heard a dog barking in my room, but there is no dog. Hallucinations are not only visual. They need to do something about the hallucinations. I hallucinated my house was on fire. It got to the point that they needed to add an anti-psychotic medication. Some examples are: Abilify, Geodon, Zyprexa, seraquel, & many others. Most of these meds cause a lot of weight gain. Geodon has the least affect on weight. 
If you ever need advice or just someone to talk to. Please message me.",1
"Eh don't worry about it, clearly a good portion of people here (at least the admins) thinks there is a one size fits all solution (pharmaceuticals) to mental health problems when of course that is a silly ridiculous notion that needs to be squashed out.",1
"You need to call her psych & tell them you need an emergency appt. Although I'm in Australia, most psychs will keep time aside for emergencies, I know mine does because I've had my own appt delayed due to an emergency. Also, if you can't get her in early enough, take her to your local ER for immediate mental health unit evaluation in the meantime. I don't want to frighten you but with the symptoms you've described, she needs immediate care. Does she have someone who can care for her & be with her all the time? I truly hope you find the help you need as soon as possible.",1
"I can't fully relate however I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and after a year of being on the same meds they stopped working because I didn't coordinate them with counselling which is apparently what I was supposed to do, my meds are switched now and I feel great again and now I am doing counselling so I hope I can stay on the same ones this time. My point being after being on the same meds for a year they're may have lost thier effects.",1
"Nightmares, flashbacks panic attacks the list goes on, I'd suggest seeing a dr if u have concerns",1
"I know what it's like to wake up every morning wishing you hadn't. Nobody understands unless they go through it. It was my little boy that kept me going. I could never have left him and the thought of what it would do to him. He would have been the one to find me as I'm divorced and we live alone. But I can promise you that it will get better. Once you've got on the right medication things will change. Just hang in there and focus on your little one. He/she is worth living for. Like the other lady said , if you feel that you will be a threat to yourself go to A&E. your little one needs you. And so does everyone else. We can beat Bipolar and we will!! X",1
"I really wish you the best,  trust me. Suicide is NEVER the answer. ESPECIALLY if you have wonderful kids that need you. If your husband can't see what he has then that is his loss and you deserve so much better for you and your beautiful angels. Recently I have had a family member commit suicide and he had 2 children and trust me when I say that those little girls are going through too much for a kid to handle just wondering why their dad didn't want to be with them anymore. Life is beyond too short as it is. Look to GOD and look into those babies eyes and I promise life will start to fall back together. You may be crushed right now but I have severe anxiety and depression and have been there. My mom is manic depressive which is a term for bipolar and she gets pretty bad and I have to tell her how much we all love her and would die without her. She is my rock! Such a strong woman. And YOU TOO can be that STRONG! May GOD BLESS YOU!",1

If you are at risk of harm you must go to the er. It's really important. The 4th isn't that far away if you can hang on until then. Can you see your dr sooner? All the best.,1
Reading this gave me anxiety.. It is all this to a T,1
"Lol. I was afraid to keep reading, like yup' damn another one...",1
I'm afraid of the hospice too but do what you gotta.,1
Did not know that my experience was that it made me irrationally angry pretty much 100% of the time.,1
Hey if you are starting a mood swing I doubt it is the Wellbutrin this fast- it is actually a great antidepressant for bipolar disease.  I bet you are just starting to swing- the question is will it be the big mania swing or just a mixed state.  I second Denise and Kristin- if you need the hospital then just go back and tell them that person is a trigger for you and they will need to help you avoid that trigger.,1
"Just because there was one person having a crisis, does not mean that you can't go back there!! It will happen again, and it could be you the next time. You need to trust the doctors and go back!! Welbutrin is ok, but if it is sending you into mania, that is NOT ok. A hospital stay can regulate your meds to give you some stability,  believe me, I have been there.

During my last stay there was one woman who was not stable and she was all over the place. I just avoided her. When it got really bad, the staff let us watch a movie in another room. 

So please, don't let this get in the way of your health and well-being!",1
"Yep, been there... Latuda, Prazosin, Lurasidone and Cannabis.  NO alcohol. None. Not a drop.  Do everything within your power to keep a regular sleep schedule.  Life isn't over, but it will be different. Bipolar 2 mixed/PTSD (military), etc.  My deep depression is in remission after ECT/Latuda.  Mania is still an issue, but seems manageable most of the time, now.  Hospital stays suck.  I wouldn't ever consider ECT again, but it did temporarily help.  The memory loss that comes with ECT is horrible. You can get through this, just dig-in and hold-on for life!",1
"The hospital is rarely like that. It's scary when it happens though, I sympathize with that. I can relate to a lot of what you're saying. Hang in there, things swing around eventually.   ",1
Honey you DO still have the option to go back to the hospital.  Just because you left once (with doctors okay) does not mean you can not go back when and if you need to. Sometimes it's very helpful to be in the hospital for a bit. I can imagine how hard and scary your time there was though.  I've taken wellbutrin before but it's been a while. If you need to talk to someone like you feel free to private message me. I'll keep your aninimity.,1
"I looked at your meds but I don't see you on mood stabilizers! You are yo-yoing! I avoid depression and mania via lithium and Zonisamide, and I take an atypical anti psychotic ziprasidone to shut my mind down from thinking at night and keeping me awake. Anti depressants can make depression way worse and induce mania. Mood stabilizers don't do that. I would seriously overhaul your regime.",1
"Find a therapist I am bipolar 1 depression anxiety I am on buspar lithium, latruda, seraquil just started seraquil world of difference in the last month hope you find something that makes you feel better",1
"Keep trying.  Never give up. I was at a point where I was so scared to leave the house, I would only go to the mailbox and straight back in the house. I had to change my meds about 30 times but I finally found a working combination 
 I still get the anixety attacks but not every day.",1
I remember my 1st time in a psych ward. Security guards were called twice to hold down patients to give them a shot and put them in the quiet observation room. I was scared to death and add that onto my psychosis and eventually I was the one held down and shot in the backside and In a quiet room. Now I have greater control of my own mental health and I am lucky enough to have the option of checking in to a private facility before I get bad enough for shots and quiet rooms. I have medication but the thing that really helped me was seeing a psychologist. Yes we dug up some painful memories that hadn't dealt with like child abuse and rape and a violent father but my psychologist taught me tools that I could use to take charge of my mental illness rather than have my illness control me. If you can handle it give it a second chance. If they want you to bring up stuff you don't feel safe doing ask them about CBT and tools you can use to help you cope with this illness instead. Once you build up some trust perhaps then can you start digging. I have bipolar I and while I'm not always stable like at the moment I feel depressed thanks to chronic pain I think I'm doing ok. It can happen. You can learn to live with this and be in control. It just takes time and a lot of hard work. Take care and good luck,1
"Its a long arduous journey finding the right meds!!!! & Hospitals can be scary places too!  Look into genetic testing for what meds will work best with your DNA instead of waiting weeks/ months & side effects....we see clients 2-3 times per week & have each patient closely monitored every 2 weeks by their prescriber to keep u stable & avoid hospitalizations, good luck, here's sum info to start...., laterhttp://blog.dnagenotek.com/blogdnagenotekcom/bid/95403/Saliva-DNA-enables-pharmacogenetic-testing-for-psychiatric-medication",1
I've been on wellbrutin as well and think I need it changed. I've had depression and anxiety all my life. You just have to have faith and yes find another Dr. You can trust. I know it's hard but don't ever give up it will get better.❤,1

I went through a wonderful pletra of meds trying to control the bulk of symptoms and maintain consciousness and to figure out exactly what my diagnoses where it's not a pretty road and I am thankful that when I had given up on everything I had someone come into my life and inch and nudge me and build me up to going back and became my voice when I had no words to explain",1
"I am also a suicide survivor! I have so many years struggling with bipolar/depression disorder. I'm so glad that you have interests that can make you happy. I have yet to find mine and its been along, long time, since my diagnosis. I have found things to throw myself into but they never last. At the moment it's an irrelevant job one of many I've had. It's physical so I guess it's positive for now. I also find therapy a must to work through our complicated minds. I only recently found a therapist that I click with. Prior to her I spent years taking the steps but going no where. As of today I'm sticking with the program. Even with therapy and meds I believe I need more! I recently inquired about group therapy. I need, need, need to be around people like me and understand from experience. I'm so sick and TIRED of being ""sick"" and I can't afford to mess up or make anymore bad decisions! Is anyone on this site from Michigan?? I'm all over the place! I just meant to welcome you to this site......welcome! Lol",1
"Same, I don't really get angry tho, more like overwhelmed, when it's really bad for me, I feel like it also just sucks the life out of everyone around me and I feel like such a monster, that I want to run and hide from everyone. The emptiness and depressed feeling can be so crazy, when I get into that 'wanting to end it all' state of mind, it's not that I actually want to 'end it all' I just wish my feelings and thoughts would silence themselves for once.

I think I've got a lot to talk about with my doctor!.. DBT therapy.. Or bipolar?  I'm so confused   ,1
"It's all manageable with DBT Therapy, but it takes a lot of effort on the patient and a lot of times closes family struggle to understand the illness that I struggle with every day. If you are reading this and realize it sounds like you know you can fight it but it takes a lot of work.",1
This explains so much! Everything is about bipolar/depression/anxiety. I understand BPD goes hand and foot with PTSD.,1
"Jason Borderline Personality Disorder ,bipolar, depression,anxiety,ptsd all have some symptoms which may seem the same. This does not mean you necessarily have them. Also therapy can remove Borderline and anxiety but not bipolar or ptsd. But improve it immensely and how to deal with it.",1
Honestly I would ask her about it. I've been through this and it's a nightmare. Anxiety and depression affect me as well and you can't just go on not knowing. If it blows up in your face yeah it's going to hurt but at least you're going to know why she's acting that way. I wish you luck and I hope you can stay strong. This will pass.,1
"I had similar experience. She and I were close for more than a year, but that was it--close. Yes, we knew each other's feeling, she admitted she loved me but she didn't wanna go further like commitment. She told me she had a boy who came to her house almost everyday and her parents seemed to like him. She was afraid to hurt me if we were coupled. Although we didn't have official relationship, but it still hurt me. I expected too much because it's hard, sooooo hard to get a girl in a country which homophobic. Then, she suddenly disappeared. No trace at all. My heart was broken. So, I think it's better for you to make it clear with your girl, what do you want, how do you feel about her. At least you help yourself to get an answer about the relationship between you two. I found it easier to go on or even to let her go after we opened our minds and talked about it. You need to say how you feel. I dated 20 girls (yes, I was a player once), and most of them needed certanty about the feelings.",1

I'm having a terrible day. Angry at everyone. Been so depressed now for more than 30 days in a row. Hiding in my bedroom away from people. Pushing my friends away. I'm trying to fix the urge to cut but fear I'm not strong enough to keep ignoring the call of the blade.  Please I need help.,1
I fight it every day april i only go to work and store because o have to. Really dont want to leave the house tried so many meds didnt work Xanax is helping a little but tried to avoid that drug my next step is to see psychiatrist im thinking try to stay strong i know it is so hard  ,1
"Being angry and full of rage isn't usually part of the manic phase. You're angry and irritable because you don't feel good. Depression gets to you that way.

While nothing completely takes it away for me, there are things that help me take the edge off. Talking to a friend can help relieve some pressure. If you have family nearby, hugs and positive statements can go a long way. Getting outside for a walk and getting a little exercise can help. All of that is easier said than done. Being depressed and holding back anger is exhausting and it's hard to leave the house sometimes. 

You may need to consider medication. It's not a cure but it can help much of the time.",1
"OMG, THIS IS TOTALLY SO SO TRUE.  BEING OUT OF COMFORT ZONE IS TERRIFYING",1
"I take 6 different medications each day. Obviously they all differ in amount (mg), strength/type of drug & treatment/reason for which they're prescribed. 
It's not about how many medications you take, it's about finding the right combination & dosage to level you or to improve your health.

Don't worry about the amount or number of medications your on, worry about feeling whether they're working for you. 
But please make sure to have your Lithium levels checked regularly. I have mine checked every 3 months.",1

"My brothers 30 and has autism, there's no pill for that my darling. And no cure. Just therapy. Bro and i have lived together our whole lives. I know all about it. Yet I can only speak of what it's like to live with an autistic person, I can't speak of what it's like to HAVE it. Although, 30 years.....I've come to know my brother very well. Anyway, with everything else you mentioned a good doctor and medication can make you feel better but not fixed I'm afraid :-) I have severe depression, severe anxiety panic disorder,  borderline personality disorder, avoidant personality disorder, type 2 bipolar, RLS, cerebral palsy and I'm half deaf. I'm a beauty I tell ya lol. There's always help. I'd love bro to go to therapy, but it's hard to explain my brother. He won't go.",1
There's no quick fix I'm afraid and medication is not going to resolve all your issues. I would also suggest seeing another specialist to confirm that all your diagnoses are correct. If you genuinely do have all I wouldn't imagine you would be able to function at all. Bipolar depression anxiety can all be helped with medication but therapy important especially with depression anxiety and eat I g disorder to identify underlying cause. There are no specific meds to treat BPD therapy is most beneficial but BPD can cause associated depression anxiety as above that can result can be treated. Autism not sure about but don't think so. Second opinion is my advice though.,1
"This sounds like me.  Although I was diagnosed with Hypomania.   I take Latuda 80mg, Valium 5mg as needed and 600mg Neurontin as needed.  
I don't get the agitation and irritability but still get depressed.  Most days I'm mildly depressed or just feel flat, nothing.  It's not pleasant.",1

At first you may still feel very anxious. I was dizzy a tad nauseous and tired the first time and this time. This medication has saved my life and family. No regrets, it's been a blessing. Sorry for your loss and I hope your partner gets relief soon. Deep breathing helps and check out beyond blue website for other tips and help. I have called them a few times and they were great. Good luck :)",1
"New meds they say give up top three months to be fully effective HOWEVER he should start seeing some results within a few weeks. I would suggest if his tension and such is high which is understandable maybe find things that might take the edge off while he's adjusting... If he likes the gym, nature hikes, video games, drawing.... A hobby perhaps.... Something to charge his focus from baby even for a moment might help",1
"I have lost many friends. I only really have one friend at the moment. She used to be my occupational therapist, and after treatment we became friends. She is a friend like I have never had, she would do anything for me. My other friends turned their backs on me for many reasons, 1. they couldn't handle my illness, 2. they thought my suicide attempt was just to get attention, 3. they didn't really care about me. 4. I was putting more energy into the relationship than they ever did.
I miss having other friends, as I don't go out allot as I suffer with social anxiety and bipolar depression. So it would be nice if I had more ppl to communicate with and feel supported by. But at least I have my folks and my one friend. You have to weigh it all out and go from there. It definitely isn't easy.",1
"First you talk about contributing to the conflict, then you talk about being betrayed. It's a little contradictory. It's a little hard to give advice because it allows for too much speculation and assuming. But this is my point of view. I have PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Mental illnesses run in my family. My younger sister has the same issues, but also has schizophrenia and borderline personality. She is always using her illness as an excuse, but she may not realize it. I try to give her the benefit of the doubt, but I have cut her out of my life. She is abusive, emotionally and physically,  and believes that people should accept her just the way she is because that's how she was born. I personally think that she should take an assessment of how she is and quit expecting people to put up with being hurt because that's just who she is. I'm not saying this case is like that, but without more information,  I can only go off my own experience. It isn't just about others accepting you, it's about you accepting them as well. Doing things that push people away is self centered and it may be time to take an internal inventory. If you want to be a part of life, if you want loved ones around, don't use your issus as an excuse to treat people poorly. Get on meds, get into therapy, actually care about people, instead of only focusing on yourself and how you feel. My husband and I have a lot of mental issues and fight constantly, I know how you're feeling. Please understand that I'm not try to be a jerk, just speaking from the experience of someone who has absolutely zero friends.",1

I have an alarm set for my meds. I get them all ready for the next day the night before.,1
I'm so sorry...... I'm blessed with insurance from working for 32 years for the state. It seems there should be some consideration  and compensation for those who need their meds... makes me ashamed of our country!,1
I was suffering depression and anxiety. Was at the point of a breakdown. It did take a while to work though.,1
"Yes, #45. Why do you think so many of us are anxious about the future of our country?",1
I mean I'm all about a second opinion  but my actual Dr said it most likely is bipolar and the meds seem to be helping .... minus the insomnia and horribly vivid dreams,1
"Absolutely there are many who suffer PTSD from traumatic birth. Particularly those whose children were born premmie, or if there were medical complications for mother and baby before and after birth. 
I don't know where you are but there are a few pages specific to women whom suffer from Birth trauma. Here in Australia one such page is called PANDA (Perinatal Anxiety and Depression Australia).

You may also have other underlying problems from the type of environment you grew  up in.",1
"I have two autistic sons. There's no 'fix' let alone a 'quick fix'. Autism is to be taken much more seriously than that. If there were a fix, believe me, millions of people would have been onto that a long time ago. It does not exist & I'm not sure one ever will.

So, Bipolar & similar disorders are something that are usually developed over time.

You are born with autism. 

My sons have what is called co-morbid diagnoses meaning they have more than one diagnoses being, ASD (autism spectrum disorder), GAD (general anxiety disorder) & ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Which makes for a very potent mix BUT they are classified as 'high functioning' meaning they function at a higher capacity than other ASD sufferers. 
There are three degrees or 'levels' of function. High, moderate & low. The less a sufferer is able to do for themselves, the lower the level of function.

You need to contact a GP (general practitioner) to request a referral to a specialist in ASD. This specialist may want to do their own assessment of you to gain a starting point. Then they will generally become your therapist/GP who will guide you & medicate you if required.

Please remember though, there is nothing wrong with you. You have the ability to see the world & everything in it differently & who is to say that this is wrong? You are special & I know that you would have skills & strengths that you could tap into like the arts, writing or painting to name just a few. Do not waste ant talent or interest you have, this is how ASD people function best.

Good luck Laurie   ",1
"Wow you are going through a lot aren't you. Unfortunately I don't know of a quick fix. Autism there is no cure. As for your other disorders there may be medication that can help but they may start to notice a difference in a few weeks up to 6. There are some anxiety meds like Ativan and xanax that can work straight away but most Drs either don't like to prescribe it or only allow you to use it short term because it's easy to overdose on it, you can build a tolerance to it so you need it more and you can get addicted leaving you with something else to deal with. One of the best treatments for anxiety and depression is cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness which either a psychologist or therapist uses. You can look them up online. There are a lot of examples of things to try particularly mindfulness. There are even apps for your phone to help. Unfortunately this isn't a quick fix but they teach you tools that you need to practice everyday so you have them on board when you come up with a situation or feeling that makes you uncomfortable or anxious. I really wish I could give you better news. Somebody else here might have a different perspective. I'm just going on personal experience. I have bipolar I and anxiety disorder and my nephew is on the autism spectrum. Take care",1
Great when you try to go bowling but can't because people are watching and you have a panic attack woohoo! Then your boyfriend starts yelling at you and asking you why you aren't bowling and you just try not to cry. Like sorry I'm like this????,1

"Hello Jay, settle down if you can, you sound a bit panicked. How can we make this depression not as bad as the last? The first thing I'll share is have what you have and I'm on mood stabilizers, lithium and Zonisamide at night. These level me out and I get extra rest with an atypical anti psychotic ziprasidone. In daytime I get up and get 64 colors, more like 128 get a canvas with a pre-made drawing on it from Hobby Lobby and I imagine my depression and I pick colors reflecting it, and I then try to depict what depression feels like. Trust me, if you're coloring, you can't go lower. It's melodic and clears your brain and doesn't allow any bullshit in. I did this for five days straight and I walked away from the cliff. Colored in five canvases and got sleep. And took my meds.",1

Not sure I can help but I can empathise I'm in my 40s  and for some reason over the past few years I keep dwelling on the amount of time out of my life that's been wasted because my MH. Don't know if it's getting older but I do find It does become harder to stay positive and not dwell on past especially when things aren't that much different. But I have actually managed to do some things like join a couple of groups and have met different people which I've never really managed before. I plan things ahead to look forward to.  I think about my children and possibility of grand children.,1

It's amazing how incredibly different each one of us are.  Effexor became the devil in my head. I still remember....",1
"Agree, listen to doc, but it was hell for me, too. If you've ever seen Trainspotting....  kind of like that. Brain zaps, nausea, migraines, on and on. Horrible. I tapered slowly under doc's supervision, and still, hell.",1
"I now have a name for it, and it's not so scary! I slowly tapered off ALL my meds about a month or 2 ago, and still feel like I'm withdrawing and get a loud noise in my head and then it feels like electricity. I have had only a few good days but it seems to be getting better as time goes by",1
It's so good to know someone knows the struggle. No one warned me.,1
"Meditation for me, I put my earphones in and put on some loud nice music that I like, no words just slow music. And I to do a little mental procedure of mindfulness,, getting into my here and now state, to me it's lining up my energy because when I'm having a panicked attack or anxiety I'm all out of whack,,, it's your body trying to tell you something and getting lost that's all. Sometimes if it's really bad, excersise ,   Controlled breathing, umm if I'm at home, a warm shower or 5 min laying down quietly",1
"Those are all common symptoms of anxiety, medication helps many people, exercise helps boost medication, ensuring you eat good foods and sleep enough helps your body be healthy.

Ask your doctor about medication
Ask your friends to exercise with you
Ask the people you live with to help make sure you eat properly and don't sleep all day.

Practicing  mindfulness helped me move forward with my illnesses, but it works better in conjunction with all of the things I've listed",1
Omg I am on Seroquel for probly 15 yrs now. And I can sleep all night and day + wil but in cipralex and lorazapam. I'm still depressed and anxiety.,1
"I take serequel, but I have to cut it in half. It makes me sleep 12 to 14 hours. Of I get up sooner, it's a struggle to make myself do anything.",1
Aw honey I'm so sorry u feel like this.. It will get better.. Msg me if you want. I have a daughter who wanted to jump off the railway bridge and she's better now.. I myself have bpd... I still struggle but I'm doing great.. We can help if you want.. There are things you can do to help yourself without doctors xxx. God bless you xxx,1
I have the same struggles. Its impossible to function without sleep.,1
It is...I'm at the back end of a psychotic manic episode that lasted 9 days...not 1 hour sleep for 6 days and last night I finally got 4 hours and I can feel I'm coming down at last...the 2 things I normally do when manic I tried to avoid doing but failed to stop doing 1 of them and at least I won't hear no more damn voices or see shadow figures moving about...people always think mania is some exciting thing where everything is great..wish they could understand that there's a lot of shit too,1
"I worried about my memory and my sentence structure but  not sure it is just the meds or whether it is our bodies telling us to slow down and steady up.  I have found I have to plan and prepare now whereas before I could do anything in the blink of an eye, but now if its not on the schedule I get a bit lost. Think its all the overthinking and hard work catching up.",1
I have been on Quetiapine for over a decade and have seriously bad short term memory loss. I'm only 34 and my doc is already using words like dementia and Alzheimers and doing further tests in that direction. I'm scared stiff xxx,1
"I'm also on both. However, I attribute my memory loss/poor memory to mental illness because even without the meds I experience it. I used to have a great memory but as I've gotten older and my mental health has gotten poorer so has my memory. I am 39 and my memory is horrible. I've forgotten things I've done or said within the last hour. It sucks.",1
"Jessica White you should definitely read up on the topic. Most of the articles and studies that I have read show a direct link between bipolar disorder and dementia. Apparently people with bipolar disorder have an increased risk of developing dementia. I am diagnosed bipolar 1, OCD, PTSD w/anxiety disorder, and  ADHD. My brain is a mess. Lol All kidding aside, I have also read up on all the medications I am currently taking and have taken in the past. Medications I need to function......to keep myself alive. Well many of those medications have unfortunately also been linked to Alzheimer's and dementia. With all this information I would have to conclude that both our illness and medications are slowly wearing away at our minds, our memory. Nothing can function at full speed forever without experiencing some sort of wear and tear, some sort of damage. Even the best and fastest computers eventually start to slow, start to become overwhelmed with data, start to stall, become full, stop taking in new data. Until eventually freezing up and denying you access to the data you did have. I think of the brain in the same way. With bipolar disorder or anxiety for example, comes the whole mind racing symptom. Our mind refuses to shut down. It just doesn't stop. Just think of our minds as a computer. Sucks right? Educate yourself, don't fixate on it. Knowledge is power. Even if we only retain bits and pieces. Lol",1
"I'm 39 as well.   I wonder if my memory issues are related to bi-polar as well.   But,  with a history of Alzheimer's in my family, I worry about that to.  And when I say worry,  I mean fixate...to the point of exhaustion.",1
"It's draining . I find that exercise , eating properly and just not being afraid so speak your mind helps a lot . I'm a nurse and sometimes I feel like ill upset someone and the truth is I've learned that anxiety can be treated my simply just eliminating toxic people in your life and appreciating the positive people in your life . Family , friends coworkers and people you trust",1
"Life is precious Marlene . I have a gratitude journal which i fill on my worse days . Helps to break me out of darkness . I suffer from both anxiety , depression and extreme lonliness on my worse days .",1
I have both and it's horrible,1
I had a miniature poodle who knew when I was struggling and would be there for me. Now we have cats and one of them is very clingy with me. He sits outside my bedroom at night waiting for me to wake up and he'll come in for cuddles. The minute I sit in the lounge room he jumps up and won't leave me be. Most of the time I appreciate it lol. Animals can pick up on moods emotions and illness. They are very special like that.,1
Remember everyone has a different response to medication. We all are biologically different. That's why different medications are made. I have read the posts below that said Effexor was horrible for them. For me it saved my life. No side effects. I am 48 and am bipolar. I have taken it around 7 years. The important thing if you are bipolar is that you MUST also take a mood stabilizer such as lithium or Lamictal with it or you will go manic taking any antidepressants by itself. Best of luck!,1
Effexor gave me horrible side effects. I now have lasting tremors because of it.,1
It also did awful things to me. I wanted to kill myself. I have never felt that way before. I was hysterical all the time. I was so sick and had severe panic attacks and nightmares.,1
"I do understand being with bi polar and depression and having the server anxiety so on ANY level my friend being alone is just where I have found myself EVEN having so called friends  living  in same  town.. everyone's body of course is different and we'll we are an experiment "" 
bunny"" when it comes to medicines, I have learnt over MY 16 years of being bi 
 polar if after 4 weeks on something and I'm worse in any form (on which NO one knows your body and mind like yourself) THEN I switch I refuse to suffer for months like I have before....  I am all ears to just listen sometimes that's what we MOST need....",1
"Wellbutrin is actually REALLY bad for you. It's in the same category as neurontin and lyrica. Horrible, horrible drugs.",1
"Listen to me, there is no fucking shame in getting medical help. Medicine is good for you, it can help you, and it can help prevent another break down. Therapy can help, but if you won't break your pride to try, then you're on your own. Naturally, being wise enough to get help is the best way to go. Think before you act.",1
"Well, that's a shame. Because the forbidden topic is the only thing that has effectively treated either my depression or my hypomania. Too bad we can't gain support for the overturn of unjust laws that keep medicine from people who need it.",1
"Cannabis isn't taboo!!! Its the only thing that has ever helped my depression, anxiety and my migraines. I went from 5 pills to no pills. 
Spread the truth, stop living in fear!!! You asked for people's opinions so we can help others. 
Its time others know there is an alternative to shoving pills down your throat that has side effects 3 miles long. 
You want to help people but you want to censor us?
#EndTheStigma
Its not illegal to simply discuss cannabis.",1
"Julie, and everybody in general: ""Chemical"" or ""natural"", it doesn't fucking matter - Max has a point, many of us would be dead or non-functioning or leading much more miserable lives without that ""little pill most people swallow."" It doesn't matter that those pills have been ""refined by man"" - much of our FOOD, our HEALTHY food, is refined as well. A lot of stuff has had SOMETHING done to it. That doesn't make it bad or unhealthy or ""unnatural.""
So, I suggest:
1. Doing what works for YOU as an individual.
2. Shutting the fuck up trying to advise others how to deal with THEIR mental illnesses.",1
Meditation is helping me with depression and anxiety,1
"<tl;dr> read about neuroplasticity, change your habits.

Change your habits, research about neuroplasticity and how you can ""rewire"" your brain. Unfortunately, there's no single method to get rid of depression. I've tried increasing the intake of food that's high on antioxidants (even tried oil pulling hahaha), exercised, meditate, etc. I have not tried psychotherapy though as my main pdoc says I'm not ready yet (still on clonazepam for my anxiety and sleep problems). What might work for you will not work on someone else so - it's more on experimentation. When I'm depressed (which is more often now, I cry and let myself feel the pain and hollowness)

<trigger>

Then I really think hard why I'm sad, why I feel that way. Most of the time, I can't find the answer. So - I'm there crying for no apparent reason. It's so ridiculous I find it funny sometimes. I don't think about suicide, but death sounds inviting sometimes. </trigger>",1
STAINT JOHNS WORT IS ALL NATURAL IT HELPS BOTH WITH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY BUT IF YOU ARE ON MEDS  PLEASE ASK YOUR DOCTOR FIRST,1
"The number one thing that helped me was becoming a fur - parent. I adopted a little silk Maltese at 10 months old...he is my rock ♡.

On another note: I take onnit, unsure if you would call it natural or not, but the mood onnit really helped me out a LOT. I can actually sleep at night solidly.",1
I smoke CBD oil in am e-cig to help with anxiety when I have to go out and about. CBD oil is perfectly legal and is sold in little bottles in some ecig shops. It really does help me x,1
*note to admin* cannabis is not illegal in every state and most states have medical marijuana. But if you wanted any honest opinion of mine. Cannabis is better for anxiety and ptsd. Just saying.,1
"CBD has helped my husband  who suffers from TBI, PTSD, anxiety and depression. Plus he can't overdose on cannabis nor are there any real negative side effects oh and he can still fully function and does not get a high at all. Go natural medicine!",1
EleganceIn Crafting I feel the same way.  I'm very happy that you found a MEDICINE that has improved the quality of your life.  That is what matters!  No shame in that!,1
"Yes!!!! Heather Welch lol people don't realize that we make change by talking about things openly and truthfully. I'm so tired of the cannabis shaming. I haven't been able to do anything even leaving my apartment except once a week for therapy for 3+ years. Since I've gotten prescribed cannabis for my pain, depression, anxiety etc guess what? I went to the Empire State Building I have been able to go to eat at a restaurant among a few other things I haven't been able to do in a long time or at all before. And guess what?  It's all because of cannabis. It annoys me so bad when people don't look at actual scientific evidence before making statements. I feel like its a personal attack on me every time. SMH",1
Legality is no reflection of morality.  I'm irritated by this as cannabis has saved my life many times AND is the only thing that has ever worked!  I prefer nature.  At least i won't die.,1
"So then, for those of us that do live where it is legalized for medicinal usage and that is all we use, does that mean we are excluded from making suggestions, or even speaking about to anyone on here, or perhaps even others who do? 

I think that's a bit unfair and it was an incorrect limitation put on the subject/topic matter because there is some value and worth in medical cannabis.

And, just to say why I boldly questioned the limitation...I cannot take the chemical medications anymore. 20 plus years of doing so as prescribed, I now have brain damage due to 'professional medical treatment.' I have brain damage. I also have brain deterioration. I also have Tardive Diskenesia. I gain health issues that were never there because of chemical medications. My heart stopped long enough to be declared legally dead, but somehow, I'm still here. So, what about folks like me? Do I not have any valuable suggestions because the best suggestion I have with any valuable worth is medical cannabis? I didn't say just 'cannabis,' because that would be implied recreational use, and that's not what it's about.

It may not be federally legal, but according the laws of the states who have passed it....it's legal. My certification says it's legal. My Medical Cannabis I.D. card that is state regulated and must be renewed and re-evaluated yearly says it's legal. The fact that I can sit on my porch and have a county Sheriff on the other side of the driveway at someone else's house sees me sitting on my porch smoking it and he smiles, nods his head, says how are you? Gets in his vehicle and drives away while I'm still on my porch have a toke or two....that also says...it's legal.....

So, I do beg to differ on your statement that it isn't legal. And, if you don't like my statements, kick me out of the group. Why? Because the entire world should have a toke and chill out on cannabis....

It also helps me focus. It helps my muscles and joints relax and have less tension. I also have Tourettes Syndrome. I've had it all of my life. It helps my tics because it helps me to relax. Stress exacerbates my tics, even internal stress due to other health issues as well. It helps me to deal with severe PTSD issues, otherwise, I may hurt someone because I've been triggered in a bad state ( I don't want that, nobody else does either). Helps with my anxiety, it calms me down better than an addictive chemical like Adavan or Xanax, or a painkiller which only make me sick, which exacerbate all of my health issues more.

I have so many more health issues than I can list here and so many environmental things right down to the barometric pressure in the air and even that can be quite a task to deal with and manage through. It helps me sleep, I have been diagnosed with insomnia since I was a kid. It helps me to have an appetite. I don't eat when I'm stressed. Problem is, with my internal issues (health issues) and environmental issues that affect my internal issues and ultimately become a vicious circle right back out of me, I have a toke or two, I calm down and I get hungry. I can't eat when I'm stressed or under stress, I get sick and throw up everywhere. How about migraines? Medical cannabis helps with migraines.

DO you understand what I'm getting at here? If I continued to take the chemical medications, having stopped for my life in 2011....I'd be dead...Why? Because of chemical medications that 'professionals' shoved down my throat. I'm 38 years old and I feel so broken and incapable...I'd rather not be breathing...at all...but I have people who depend on me...like my kids...and my partner who is also disabled, but I've take a toke or two and I'm so much more pleasant, an enlightened, happy loving, caring mood, I enjoy my kids and their energy, I enjoy my partner's horrible humor...I can laugh instead of wanting to break down and bawl and wonder when the next big crash is coming.

It might not be right for everyone, but to exclude people from talking about it or even referencing it because it's a worldwide page and it's not legal everywhere....well, that's no different than most of us have experienced in our lives...being excluded for this or that or the other thing. Oh, excuse me while I eat an entire brownie and get some well needed sleep and wake up feeling okay instead of taking a pill that makes my heart race when I already have gained heart issues from those professional prescribed chemicals, several of which put me in the E.R. Had I not gone to the E.R. each of those times....my heart would have beaten itself to my death and exploded in my chest. So, please, tell me, if the chemical medications don't work for me, but medical cannabis does? Does that mean I have no valuable input? Does that mean I have nothing to contribute because it will be deleted? Go ahead. Delete it. Delete me, too. I find the lack of ability to allow for inclusion is mighty sad. You know....being gay can get someone killed in other countries. It's outlawed in some other countries....should I stop being gay where I live when I can do so legally and freely simply because it's outlawed in other countries and not legal? Sorry, I don't think so....

You know what else? Here in the states...we drink Coca-Cola as a soft drink......they sell it as cleaner in other countries....you can find it in the household cleaner section....not here, you find it in the soda isle.....

But, far be it from me to say anything....who am I....I'm a medical cannabis patient and I know nothing.....apparently...",1
"I have an emotional support dog, he was my dog for 4 years then I got really depressed and so I noticed he really helps me when I don't feel to great, he cuddles me licks my hand( i know gross) he just tries to make me happy and it really helps. So I registered him and he was trained to sit, come, shake, high five, give kisses, and go away already because of his age and working with him a lot. I highly suggest it for anyone with depression, or any anxiety. He helps me with both. Hope this helps",1
"My pit bull is my emotional support dog. I'm able to focus on her and not all my crazy worries when we're out together. She's not registered so we're limited on where we can go. We do pharmacy drive thru, Starbucks, Sonic for her ice cream treat, walking at the park, and visiting the pet stores.",1
"I think it depends on where your depression is coming from. If your brain isn't able to produce certain hormones/chemicals on its own a nice walk in the woods won't help. Medication is the only way to replace those things then. Think of it like diabetes - if your body won't produce insulin on its own, it'll need help with that. 

If it's coming from stress, a trauma or something similar, natural ways like relexation techniques, talking therapies etc might help depending on how open your mind is to those things.",1
"Life inside a bi-polar mind...we talk real. Closed group I help admin. I LOVE POT! Read great for PTSD, anxiety, and bi-polar! Let's be real.. It's on the cover of freaking time magazine.. Mainstream America. Be REAL!!!",1
I agree with Tara except.  I avoided weight gain by changing what I ate and walked a lot.,1
In general in bipolar you take a mood stabilizer like lithium or tegretol or lamictal or a few others ones.  Then they tailor the other meds to where you are in a cycle and the anxiety that you are experiencing.   Yes clonazepam is for anxiety but is addictive so be careful with it.  I just started buspar which seems to be helping my anxiety and is not addictive.,1
I take klonopin for Anxiety. However I take a higher dose than most although my dr keeps close tabs because it can be addictive. I also take lithium Lamictal Seroquel and vraylar for the bipolar Rapid Cycling,1
"Firstly you have to be honest with your partner. Yes you are supposed to be honest anyway, but who really shows the ugly side in the beginning right? I'm not saying tell the person on the first date, but if you see it's going somewhere sit down and have the ""talk"". As we all know, bipolar is hard to understand and people tend to take your moods personally. I printed out a lot of information for my husband, but it was still hard for him to get that I wasn't angry or upset with him. Normal relationships can be difficult, it's twice as difficult if you are bipolar. I stuck with my motto of ""if I've done my best to educate you and you still want to use my condition as a reason to leave, don't let the door catch you on the way out"". Hard work, determination and patience is what it comes to. It's been 6 years and we are still strong, so it can be done.",1
sorry i dony understand anxiety.,1
I wna talk but I'm  embarrassed and I don't think that people wna hear my story cos everybody  got their own problems,1
"I cannot recommend mindfulness enough for anxiety. It takes practice and may not be a short term fix if you are already anxious but when you have a moment where you can focus do some research on it. It has been a god send for me. I also keep a journal of my moods. It gives me some insight how my moods are and if they are starting to get out of control. Trying to do things that give you some control over an illness that tries to take so much is a really big help. If you can see triggers or patterns, you said summer had been a trigger pattern then you might be able to do something different to try and help the situation. All the best.",1
"Sorry to hear this! Look into using therapeutic grade essential oils such as plant therapy or young living oils. They help with a bunch of different things- anxiety, sleep, pain etc. Good luck!!",1
I'm on all types. The only thing that I have to stay away from is Ativan. It made me so tired that I was late for work. Anyone that knows me knows that since I have anxiety I fear being late so I get places an hour early. That really screwed me up. I take Xanax which is not the best but works the best for me. I get a little tired but not near as bad as when I was on Ativan. But I would definitely try your options because everyone has different side effects from medicines. Good luck finding something that works ❤,1
"I'm on 1200 mg Lithium for mania and 150 mg Trazodone for sleep/antidepressant daily, and lorazepam (name brand Ativan) as needed for anxiety. Everybody is different. What works for one won't always work for another. Also depends which end of the spectrum you fall into as to which combination of drugs will work. Be patient. Tell your doctor what's happening as you get it sorted out. Side effects will vary as well. Whatever you do, don't stop taking meds once you're on them without talking to your doctor first. It could make the situation worse. Good luck to you. Hope this helps.",1
My winning combo is lithium olanzapine and mirtazapine. I have bipolar I and anxiety disorder. Remember what works for one doesn't necessarily work for another and it may take time to find the right meds. It took me 18 mths of trial and error.,1
"Top bipolar med is lithium. Some others are abilify, seroquel , lamictal and Saphris(personal favorite). A lot of anti psychotics like geodon are also prescribed for bipolar disorder. If the depression is a main concern they may add on a med specific to depression such as Zoloft or Prozac. Clonazepam is also known an Klonopin which is a benzodiazepine (helps anxiety almost immediately) works wonders for sure.",1
Believe me I am not trying to outdo you. But when I was diagnosed.  It was easier to say what I didn't have. Then it was to Say what I did have. White sent me into early retirement.   Even the judge was surprised. I didn't break down sooner. Because I had long work history at one job. One of my disorders is a social disorder. That is very devastating when I'm around a lot of people. And more so when I don't know them. I do push myself to try To tolerate as long as I can. When I go to town. I only go once or twice. A month. Sometimes a third. But not very often. Because being around a lot of people. Send me into a anxiety panic attack. Then my blood pressure goes out the roof. Yes mental disorders can kill. If one is not careful. Because of the stress it puts on one person. But like the judge said. He knew that didn't happen overnight. And could not see. How I lasted as long as I did.  One of the other things that happen. I had a complete nervous breakdown. And to close cause of having two more. When my therapist got me into a group. She said I should have been hospitalized.  But I did not have the money or insurance. And was Laid off from my job. I don't blame my Xbox for doing it. Because I was not only a danger to myself but to other coworkers. That's been 12 years ago since able to hold a job. Since then I've not been able to work a regular job ever again.  Because of the anxiety panic attacks. This next part. Is not for everyone. 7 years ago. I was faced with a dilemma. I do not know how my therapist worked it out. But all I had to use is my government insurance To pay for it. But a year after I got out of the group home. And my therapist at the time retired.  With the new replacement. I was being charged. By the doctor Therapist And nurse. And also have to pay For my medication. I could pay out of pocket and only cover two or maybe even three. But not all. Because the insurance will only cover so much. And the rest had to come out of my pocket. That I did not have. Because SSDI Does not pay a whole lot out. So I had to come up with another solution to the problem. With guidance of a doctor. That I did not have to pay. I Wing myself off the medication. And start using. Vitamins Herbs and oils. That has worked for me. For the last 7 years.  But like I said before. This is not for ever one. And just like the medications. It was a trial and error. Before I could find the right combination that works for me. So I suggest to anyone that is wanting to try this. Research it out first And talk to your physician. About it. Before starting. Even though I am doing self-medication. Natural stuff. One still has to be carefull. Because the wrong combination can be more devastating than the problem itself. So research it out if you are thinking about. And talk to your doctor too.,1

If im awake im at the bakeshop im hungry so I eat bread and one making the bread is handsome. I wish I have money if I dont have meds I just get out and look for food to eat.",1
"You could also use certain alarm clocks on your phone that won't stop remembering you until you scanned the Barcode of the packaging the medication comes with or a photo of the packaging. You need to get up, grab it and scan/take a picture of it. So you can't accidentally snooze it again and again and then forget of you just stopped the alarm or actually took the medicine while doing that.",1

Not everyone does college in 4 years or all at once. Please, care for yourself first, ALWAYS   ",1
Yes I have high anxiety being around people especially people my age as I have always been teased and treated like crap but I found that online courses work better for me because I don't have to be in a classroom and I can do the work on my own time as long as it is in on time if you are looking for a good website that offers basically any class u can possibly think of there is one called Coursera I believe it's coursera .com or edu or org but I know it's coursera hope this helps xxx,1
"I was forced to take time off because of my anxiety. I've always been a person that is determined to power through my anxiety no matter what, but it got to a point where I couldn't even sit in a classroom without feeling like my throat was closing up. The breaking point was one day when I got to class but absolutely could not go into the room. I walked the hallway a few times trying to make myself go in and I just couldn't. So I stopped going to that school and went to another where I could take online classes.

Taking time off in order to better yourself is never a negative. Sit back and relax and go back to college when you can. It's better to take the time now then to convince yourself nothing is wrong and have the same things happen when you get into the workforce. I've been through that too and I'm telling you it's not fun. Best of luck, we're all here to support you <3",1
I unfortunately dropped out of college. I had anxiety attacks everyday. My teachers weren't accommodating at all. They basically told me to choose between my education or my health. I chose my health. It was for the best. I can always go back.,1
"Right now, I'm completely overwhelmed. I'm a perfectionist on top of everything else, and with exams and projects due leading up to finals, I'm having a rough time. I can understand needing time off. I'm only taking four courses. I have no idea how people can do five.",1
"I took some time, and almost dropped out, but managed to struggle thru in the end. I have however been off work for over 4 years due to mental health issues. So I can understand your struggle. Do what is best for you.",1
"Yes, I've taken time out of class. I've also only studied part time so that I don't overwhelm myself.",1
"I've taken time off from everything in life because of mental illness, including anxiety and I guess depression and other things",1
Had a major panic attack.  Missed several classes until I could cope.,1
Yes I took a year out at uni then ended up doing my degree via OU. That was many years ago. It's not a race. If you need time it's nothing to be ashamed off. Since I started working 've also been off sick on several occasions in some instances for months. I know I'm probably quite fortunate working for public sector (NHS) and if i worked in private I probably wouldn't have the job I have.,1
I'm afraid to start.. Keep thinking I wouldn't be able to handle the pressure,1
I have a pill box with morning noon night compartments for the week. I fill it every Sunday. I then have an alarm set in my phone that reminds me and I just go to that day and times compartment. It's about setting routines. It works really well for me. I haven't stuffed up my meds for well over A year.,1
I'm lazy so I just turn my pill bottles over like an hourglass right after I take them.  Sunday is my start day so on Monday they are upside down Tuesday they are right side up and so on.  Then if I'm unsure if I've taken my meds I just count back to Sunday and I know whether the bottle should be right side up or upside down and then I know if I took my pills,1
Pill dispenser pack! It makes it so easy to just look at it and see if you've taken them already. Just set an alarm to remind yourself to refill it.,1
Reminders on your phone/check list/ alarms   ,1
Not everyone is comfortable with talking about how they will with others all the time. Who is telling you that you are not showing the right response. I don't think there are any. It's natural to be worried especially if you are a sensitive person. You are also quite young and having a baby is a big responsibility.  It's normal to be excited and looking forward to something yet at the same time be worried about  things. It probably would help to find someone to talk to but not because someone is saying you are not behaving how they think you should but to reassure yourself.,1
"Or give you PTSD, anxiety problems, clinical depression, dissociative identity disorder, etc.",1
my heart got really2x nervous when my grandfather got a heart attack my father stops buying the meds for me because I cant get up early because of my meds and I am not getting pregnant and I have 1 unsucessful pregnancy my family took me to the mental hospital and I took what the doctor prescribed I told the nurse i might be pregnant he did gave me pregnancy test but was negative but I can feel it in my tummy onetime. one tablet and its gone. hallucination halograms i dont care about it. it can kill. mental hospital has the old few clothes patients has no money and are raped and abuse and crazy dirty. Its so poor Im so ashame Im one of them.,1
"Going on 67 years and still alive.  By grace of God, its in remission mostly because of my age and help I got for myself earlier in life.. I live alone, content, peace and calmness.  Still anxiety and other damages.  I can live with it now.  Look at myself finally in the mirror.  That was hard for me for about forty years.   God be with all of you.",1
The Struggle is real!  We're survivors and fighters to face the mirror and still do what we gotta do.,1
"I'm 17 years old and have struggled with different mental illness for years. And it may sounds hard to believe but until my birthday last year I truly believed there was no 'feeling better' at all. With the right people around you and hard work on your behalf, there are ways to ease the pain. I've found more useful coping techniques from doing my own research as opposed to relying on counsellors and therapists that are only available monday to friday 9 till 5. Understanding more about your brain chemistry and why you're feeling the way you do has a greater impact in how capable you feel in managing it. We've got it really tough and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It's hard enough with hormonal changes going on, without added mental illness. Keep going, it will ease with time.   ",1
"It doesn't get better but it does get easier...... Easier to accept yourself and to not let it bother you so much. Don't let this disorder lie in the forefront of your mind either, just take your meds and live your life the best you can every day. Don't worry, people worth it will stick with you no matter what. You'll get to realize what starts that roller coaster as time goes on, it doesn't really stop it but gives you time to talk your way through it or take the charge cards and give them to someone else before you run them up on a grand spending spree!!",1
"The reality is life is hard. It's how you respond to what happens that makes or breaks you. Not every day is a good day but there are plenty of good days ahead. Decide what drama you are willing to deal with let go of the situations and people who bring nothing but negative energy in your life. Do you have a family or friends who love you??? I am a mother who lost her son to suicide he was 20 I'm telling you this because the pain you feel that makes you think you should end your life is the pain your loved ones will feel forever if you do. And if you have a mom who loves you and you take your life you sentence her to a living death. So please reconsider!!! You were given a life to live. Take care of yourself don't try to fix everything at once. When you have moments that seem too hard light a candle watch a good movie read the Bible or another good book listen to your favorite music until it passes. If you have to get a job try to get into something not so stressful, learn something new every day. Volunteer at an animal shelter if you can get a pet. Go for walks go for a swim find someone to talk to that you know you can count on. But stay in this life it's not always fair and the hard times seems to go on forever but they don't there is good in this world and it's worth fighting for",1
"Hi, 
 I found out I had Bipolar 2 at 14, I wish I could say it will just get easy all of a sudden. You will get better when you try getting better, give every treatment a fair go and be willing to try. If 30 year old me could tell teenage me anything it would be take all the help they offer. I wish you all the very best and don't be afraid it's a blessing and a curse. My inbox is always open if you need another bipolar lifer to talk too we need to stick together!",1
I have had Bi polar all my life i guess i was born with it but yes we need people in the same  boat so we can all be their and listen..give advice and empathy cause we understand each other where the so normal people dont know and dont understand and they are frightened of something they dont know..Nor understand..Thank you Rebecca.*,1
"Yes, it will get better. The times of hormonal changes are always super hard. Being a teenager makes ya kinda bipolar anyway!!!  My best friend was diagnosed and medicated from 15 until just a few years ago. I worry about her not taking meds and I'm not saying you'll get to that point but she's not had a major mid swing in about five years. Five years!!!  Depression keeps you from seeing hope but it's still there.",1
"Coming from someone that was diagnosed at age 13 and have lived with my mental illness for the last 27 years. For things to be easier take the time to learn your triggers and ques. Dealing qith bipolar or any mental illness is just the same as recovering from substance abuse or addiction.
I speak first-hand of this as my life was in turmoil for the better part of my life. When you can spot your triggers and ques you can begin to circumvent and stop the issues from pulling you back into the depths.
I pray this helps you.
Hi my name is Rob, i am a mental illness sufferer and drug addict.",1
"Pip, welcome to the rollercoaster called Bi Polar. the ups and downs, some days you dont know which way is up. i was undignosed through my childhood. finally went in myself and i have bi polar 2 with borderline personality disorder. but i dont let my illness define me. yes ive been through the gammot of meds, doctors who dont want to help me.

but if there is one thing through all these trials i have learned is people with mental illnesses are some of the strongest people i have ever met. we fight against ourselves on a daily basis just to survive. 

i know your young but that means you have a fighting chance to change your life. it will be a struggle, some days will be impossible to get out of bed, somedays youll have so much energy you will feel like Tigger! 

but if you ever find yourself in that dark hole where it doesnt look like there is a way out. make your room as dark as possible, turn on your favorite music, sit on the floor, close your eyes and breathe. i promise it will help.

good luck pip and remember we are all here for you, you are not alone in this fight.",1
"You have a lot going on right now between the bipolar and teen adolescence. One positive way to look at this is that you were diagnosed early so you can develop the right coping mechanisms that will hopefully help you live a good quality of life as an adult. So to answer your question, yes there is a good chance for things to get better. I am sorry that you are having a hard time right now. There is nothing wrong with being upset and your feelings are valid. Don't stop with therapy, and medications. You got this! Better days to come for you! 

Cassandra. :)",1
"Everybody is diffrent on their path through bipolar you get stronger as you grow and i realised its not my fault which is a much better place to be once you get there after all the doubt and self blame. My focus now is art therapy which is so amazing and less intrusive than 1 to 1 talking the ability to express how you feel instead of running over all the negatives about yourself. Setting yourself goals in really small pieces even if its tyding one shelf at a time.
A journal is good. 
My challenges are to stay on meds and keep healthy. The meds will probably change as you get older as they find ones that work better for you. 
The depression is talking when you feel everyone would be better off without you, this does get easier. Just remember you are worth being looked after and deserve a good start in life. Worrying about you is natural for your parents to do it would happen even if you didnt have bipolar. Take care xxx",1
"I was 16 when I was diagnosed. Now 32. I find it's always a roller coaster! If you know your triggers, that can help a little to avoid things from getting so ""bumpy"". I had to stop all alcohol. Which I was just a casual drinker once I became of age. But I got into bad manic phases from that, then your lows. Randomly stopping my meds made everything worse. But then having my first child while I wasn't under the supervision of a psychiatrist was THE WORST! I got postpartum psychosis!! That was a nightmare. But I then found an amazing doctor. I was later stable and had a second baby, and it was if my hormones shifted my whole brain into a state of stablness id NEVER had before!!! Anyhow life isn't always darkness or pain. There are good times. But this illness is a beast! And we do have to continue to fight it! Having a great support system, great trusted doctor or doctors is key as well! But there are good and great days in your future. But just remember it will be a roller coaster! Don't give up! Don't give in! I hope it gets better for you soon!",1
"I was diagnosed at 13, here I am at 21 and still struggle most days. I live for the good times though. I barely see anyone anymore, but I take my down time to enjoy myself, I take walks, listen to music, go volunteer, or sometimes just go get something sweet. It's a fight everyday, but the good days are the ones you look forward to.",1
"Hang in the there sweetheart! It does get better! I was 13 when I was diagnosed with bipolar. I am 32 now. With a husband that loves me beyond measure and 2 beautiful children. I take medicine every single day of my life, I do therapy as needed, and I ask for help when I need it. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Don't ever let anyone tell you different. Embrace the unique, beautiful person you are and run with it. If you ever have any questions or need to chat, you're welcome to message me Pip Mcgivern!!",1
the meds helps you relax and not make you laugh. bieng bipolar and having the medication changes my life but im struggling to look for a job so that I could have medications at night to sleep and to relax in the day. I hate this. Im bipolar for 11 years and no children.,1
"I'm on seroquel and it helps me a lot I sleep on it and it helps with anxiety I was offered it like you 5 years ago and was certain I would not take it but then ended up with phychosis severe I was sectioned and it had helped me become well then it was lowered nearly 2 years ago Aniexty got so high I had a manic episode so on it at higher doses now and diagnosed with bipolar , if I took it earlier at the lower doses I would have avoided getting so ill and would be on lower doses but I was then anti medication but now it has been a life saver I'm also on two others now lithium and venaflaxin . Good luck   ",1
"Medications work differently for different people. I've had to change 3-4 times now and finally Wellbutrin works for me in the day and 1/2 a xanax at night. I didn't like the way seroquel as it took longer to kick in and I'd fall asleep late and wake up late feeling like a zombie. I even started getting night terrors.

I work weekly with a therapist and just started group DBT therapy. One thing I can tell you that has worked very well for me is volinteering. I'm around other people who care about others and the people you help are appreciative which makes me feel better about myself.

Good luck.",1
"everybody has somethng buddy, noone is 'normal' dont feel bad about having to take a med if it helps you to feel better. i highly doubt you will be looked at 'different' its noones business anyway, noone has to know, i mean it doesnt have to be a deep dark secrect but you dont have to tell everybody either...just try it, it will probably help...",1
Has your Dr diagnosed you as having a psychosis or is it just your girlfriend who thinks you do? As for feeling embarrassed about taking meds that's totally untrue. Whether you take meds for a physical or mental health it doesn't matter it's yo help you live your life better.,1
"I am sensing a whole different question coming from you than the question about the med being okay. I am sensing a question about am I going to be looked at differently because of this medicine? well that medicine is more used for people with Bipolar. So have you been diagnosed with bipolar?  Are you willing to talk to tell people you have bipolar? if not then don't worry about it. If you don't want people to look at you differently or to think about or know about your mental illness don't share about it. I share because i feel it is part of who I am and I am open about who I am and hiding parts of me makes me feel ashamed of those parts. But for others they are like ""it ain't nobody's business"" .",1
"Who's business is It? Who's going to know? You need to do what makes you better or takes the edge off, don't be scared it will all be fine....just give it a try... thats the best you can do to help you. Good luck x",1
"Hi! Heres a little background that will help you understand where I'm coming from... My family has always shut the door to mental illness. At 19 I got pregnant and then ""forced"" into a marriage with the father (doctor refused to put fathers name on birth certificate bc we weren't married) I was then abused and had 2 more children by unconsentual sex. I finally left at age 22 with my 3 babies my ex husband tried to kill me and unfortunately lost my children (they live with my folks). I've always known that I was different mentally I've had some other pretty messed up stuff happen to me. I'm now 27 years old taking a handful of meds daily. In 2012 I finally went to get a mental evaluation per orders from DCF I went in cool as a cucumber bc I knew I was normal... Come out of there with severe PTSD bipolar anxiety depression OCD insomnia so forth & so on  and scared to death bc I wasn't normal. I've come to terms that I'm not normal but I've also become unsure of what normal is!!! I moved into a home across the alley from my folks and live a somewhat ""normal"" life. I still have the daily struggle with the fact that I'm not ""normal"" but ive also started to wonder wth normal is. I've fought with my own mother for some time about her self inflicted ignorance about mental disorders (she feels its all in. Our heads). My mom refuses to believe that bipolar is a chemical imbalance in my brain she refuses to believe that someone that isn't in the military can have PTSD she tells me that I worry too much that's what anxiety is. The way I look at it is being cookie cutter normal is boring... At least I'm exciting lol!!! Embrace who you are sweetie! We are who we are for a reason. Loving yourself especially because youre extraordinary is such a wonderful feeling...
As for the seroquel I personally have a love hate relationship with it... I am on such a high dose that I cannot function unless I take it after I am in bed for the night. I don't like the fact that I am jello after I take it but I notice a very big difference if I don't take it. My friend jokes and tells me its the pill that masks lol it helps me look ""normal"" I am on such a high dosage that it helps me through out the day function as a responsible adult. I totally understand that there is such a high stigma with mental illness but whatever it is is no different from any other disease. Its not like after diagnosis and medication it will be tattooed on our foreheads. I worried for 2 years that people could tell I was a medicated psycho but when I explained to my boyfriend he said ""it seemed like you had your ducks in a row better than most people without mental disorders"" I've showed my self harming scars and he didn't even notice the thick ugly scars until I pointed them out. I truly hope that things get better for you and that you get the help you need whatever it may be. My advice is hold your head high even when you feel that you cant, educate before you medicate,and love yourself even when you feel unworthy!",1
"I was 'assessed' and judged to be not 'at risk'. So I didn't even go to hospital. 

I do have support from a care worker and some meds have calmed me down. 

I'm just making music, editing video and photos. The things I enjoy in life! 

That is keeping me stable!   ",1
"Exactly. I'm on a disability support pension and can't afford private health insurance. Because of that, I'm always at the bottom of them pile.

Only a psychiatrist a Dr who specializes in mental illness can diagnose you. Why do your friends think this? Does anyone else? Bipolar is nit just about having up and down moods. There are two types of BP 1 which to be diagnosed you need to have at least one full episode of mania behaviour BP2 involves a more rapid cycling of depression and hypomania. Mania involves behaving recklessly putting yourself in danger  losing inhibitions thinking you are invincible have special powers over spending extreme obssessions paranoia hallucinations but not all but main difference between mania and hypomania is that with mania the person loses their insight into what they are doing  and believe it completely normal when its clear to others with hypomania the person is aware of their behaviour but unable to prevent the cycling.  It's not usually as visibly  destructive  as mania can involve being really energetic ie starting something and then suddenly stopping  anxious not sleeping obssessing compulsive behaviour . But if you are concerned you need to see a Dr for a proper diagnosis.,1
Don't take the words of a friend as a diagnosis. You must see a doctor for that. Nothing bad will happen. You may not have bipolar but another mental illness or none at all. Please don't sit and worry about this. See your doctor.,1
That's the only way you'll know for sure and be able to get the help you possibly need. I'm bipolar. Once I was diagnosed I made more sense to myself. Go. There's nothing to be afraid of.,1
"im afraid ,nervous and aghhhgg !!     i have many what ifs",1
"Recently I was started on Effexor. I also am on Topamax, Welbutrin, (weird I know) and Buspar. I also take Prasozine or Mini Pan at night. So for me, this works. But you can't just go off any med cold turkey without  having side effects that could be life threatening! You are also the person who is ultimately going to be affected by the med, so you should be the one who should have the most say in what goes in your body!! Be proactive! Get educated on ALL the drugs the can treat our condition! The information is out there on Google. Print out the sheets on each drug. Know what has and hasn't worked for you. Keep really good records for those times when you won't be able to think straight or when a loved one will need to get your history if you get hospitalized. 

I have been in this boat since I was very young and back then there was NO ONE for me. Even now it is extremely difficult to slogg through the mental health system. I have been through hell and back again. I am seriously considering starting a blog to talk about what I have been through in hopes to start a conversation about what to do and what NOT to do. My boyfriend and I also want to start a suicide support group. There simply is anything out there for those of us who came back and now must find ways to cope with what happened and keep the light burning",1
"What dose of Zoloft are you taking? I felt exactly like you (zombified) when I was taking only 50 mg. Despite my hesitancy, my psychiatrist increased my dose. He explained that low doses affect the sleep stimulator in the brain. As a result, a higher dose is necessary.",1
"I have PTSD, BIPOLAR, SCHITSOEFFECTIVE, ADD I JUST TOOK MYSELF  OFF OFF LITHIUM, PRISTIQUE, adderall, sereqil, just because i desperately want to change my dr. I found one in the same bldg. I like that one he was recommended by my therapist. They both had a meeting the other day, the one i want to go to said it would be best if i stayed with current dr? I asked why, he said to long to answer. Shouldnt i have the right to change. I am petrified of the current dr.",1
"For anxiety is lorazepam ok 
Better take first the anxiety away and take a moodstabilisator olanzapine can help low doses",1
"I'm almost 44 and the same thing happened to me just 3 weeks ago. I was diagnosed bipolar 2 almost 3 years ago. No matter what medication my doctor put me on, it didn't work. Or I had horrible side effects. I went into a 3 week day hospital program, new psychiatrist looking into my history instantly thinks ADHD. Start treating me for that, by day 2 I felt better than I have in almost 10 years. That being said, the depression/irritability is starting to come back. I fully expect at my next appt with my regular psychiatrist she'll be adding an anti depressant. ADHD was never something I thought I had, despite 8 other family members having it, including my son.",1
"each medicine can cause severe adverse effects for some.  Paxil made me almost suicidal,  Prozac and Zoloft triggered mania rapid cycling .after they would have to raise my dosages far higher.Huge withdrawal fairly quickly from SSRI I get brain zaps and auditory hallucinations,  shadows when I don't keep in my system. And found out the hard way also that one's like wellbutrin are not SSRI, but dopamine so I had 1000% SSRI withdraw and ZERO help for mental health   After 15 years of meds I've found that Lamictal is a necessity and adjusting anti depressant sometimes to very low dose when hypo mania.  Just monitor the depths of your lows or side effects,  and if that's happening,  then absolutely don't stop with only 1 medicine.  I hope that you know you are beautiful,  courageous,  and strong and reaching out and talking with others that have same diagnosis also helps us release a huge trigger many of is have. Guilt, or shame that we make others lives worse , or that anyone couldn't possibly have moods, thoughts, traits that we do.Being heard by others that truly understand is such a way to just release a clogged brain.  #DONTSTOPTALKING.

"First off, good for you for recognizing that this med was a horrible fit for you!  However, it is always best to call your psychiatrist/prescriber when you see such drastic and crippling changes... And THEY SHOULD LISTEN AND TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY AND HELP YOU GET OFF OF IT.  If they don't, time for a new doc.  But if you're EVER experiencing such crippling side effects, ESPECIALLY thoughts of any sort of harm to yourself or others, you have to call, and they have to listen and advise accordingly immediately, not expect you to wait and suffer until your next appointment.",1
Do you have any medication to take for anxiety?  Maybe that might help in this circumstance.,1

"Hallucinations are a tough on. I hear voices all the time which I know aren't real and that I should ignore. I'm on olanzapine to help with that. As for anger, have you tried mindfulness? It's used for anxiety but it helps me to focus and breathe and for anger or anxiety to pass. It might be with checking out the web and there are apps for your phone. Be careful. Hallucinations and anger can be a sign of mania. Keep in regular contact with your therapist and see if you can get into your dr sooner. Keep a journal of your moods feelings etc. it will help when you take it to your appointments. Take care.",1
"I have a wonderful healthy son. I was diagnosed 5 years before we chose to vet pregnant. I was very stable then. I have a supportive husband that helps a lot during those times of major depression. But because I have my boy it makes it easier to keep pushing through. Also during pregnancy I consulted very seriously with all my doctors about my meds. We all decided that it was safer for me to stay on them than risk an episode during pregnancy. My son was born with slight symptoms of withdrawal, but other wise completely healthy. Has been 100% fine since birth. I fell like we made the right choice for our family.",1
"I have Bipolar and a 10 year old son. I had him before I was diagnosed. We decided to not have any more children because of my diagnosis... We were afraid taking meds while pregnant would harm the baby and getting off the meds to have another baby would harm me. I did have horrible postpartum depression with my son which led to my diagnosis. It has been a real challenge being there for him, he doesn't understand why mommy gets tired or sick all the time. I am also worried about the genetics component, he has already been diagnosed with ADHD and we fear he will be bipolar as well. It's a tough decision... Consider carefully.",1
"I think there is an element of guilt ya carry cause there is a chance and no its not certain or what the future holds for you and them. I had my kids before my diagnosis, and after everything I've gone through they are my world but I feel awful for what they've been through and have 2 go through because of me plays heavy on my heart. But there is no right answers just what you think is right for you.",1

"I am just so unsure and insecure about having kids, I am sure I wouldn't have any problems taking care of them and I'm sure that they would mean the world to me, but I don't want them to grow up facing this illness. I hate it. I wish I wasn't sick   ",1
"This is a great question and one that shows a lot of fore sight on your behalf and by extention, a duty of care  to any potential child. I struggled with that decision all the way through my child bearing years but could never grasp the concept of taking care of somebody else when I can barely take care of myself. It's not something you can back out of once it's done if you don't like it. I never did have children but it wasn't because I was afraid to pass anything on but because I could not have given a child the care they need. Maybe something to think about?",1
"I wasn't diagnosed until after I'd had my children. They are both fine and well adjusted children (18 and 13), they know about my illness and I have always been honest with them about it. I think the one good thing about having the illness is that of either of them had of inherited it from me, then they would have been diagnosed a lot sooner than I was, as we know the symptoms and also, as we have experience of it, then they could be helped and understood more. Nobody else in my family has this illness but I don't think that knowing I had it would have put me off from having them. Obviously, I would have been concerned about passing it on to them as I wouldn't wish it on anyone but if you decide that you want children, then this horrible illness shouldn't stop you as there is no guarantee that they will get it. Whatever you decide in the long term, I wish you all the best ☺️",1
"It's hard having kids with BPD. I also have a TBI, OCD, and GAD. But my manic and depressive stages are even harder with kids. It can be done but sometimes it's overwhelming. And you can't take most your meds while pregnant. So be careful there too.",1
"I have 2 children. I was diagnosed at age 10. Did not take meds while I was pregnant, but life up until them was on and off my meds. Never was really under control. My son bad been diagnosed with adhd. I watch him closely afraid it was misdiagnosed and he actually is also bipolar. My daughter is wonderful no mental illness so far. I know that without my children I would not be where I  today found decent been on meds three years straight now. We are very open about our mental illness and our feelings. They have watched me struggle at times but have been there and understand what's going on when I cycle. I have made sure they are educated about it. I do not regret having them but when I had them i never took into consideration they could also be diagnosed. I was young and uneducated.",1
"I have Bipolar 2 and I am pregnant with my 4th child. My oldest two have mental health issues (not Bipolar however my 7 year old has rapid mood swings). It can be passed down and I am always scared for that. I would hate for my kids to ever feel how I have felt but I think my chances of them not getting it are pretty good. If they end up with it, at least I have experience with it. I was diagnosed a year ago and three of my kids are 3, 7, and 10. It is hard to parent when my mood are crazy but I try my hardest.",1
"Both my kids have anxiety and depression issues but because they saw me getting treatment from a young age and I got them treatment when they showed signs,they and I are dealing with our illness well and they even help me at times. My daughter is having her second child and we already talk about treatment for my grandkids if and when they show signs of anything. My Pastor is the one that taught me to get ahead of this illness with my kids,if I hadn't it would be a mess. It took me over 25-30 years to get my cocktail of meds and therapy right,my kids only took 18+ months for thiers. Be pro-active is my only advice. Children are a gift and just because you have bipolar doesn't mean you don't deserve such a tremendously wonderful gift like kids. I couldn't imagine my life without them. God Bless You.",1
"I have bp and sadly so does my 16 year old daughter. We both struggle but she struggles with it worse than I do. Theres nothing worse than seeing ur child in so much pain and not be able to ""fix"" it. It sucks. But i love her more than anything in this world. Its just me and her..we are close but we have our moments. Been struggling with this sinse she was about 7.",1
"Seroquel is killer!! 3 years ago I was put on a high dose of Seroquel. I gained over 100 pounds in one year. I didn't know what was happening. I was super confused. Finally, my Dr. took me off of it stating that I had gained too much weight and that ""Seroquel tends to do that"". I was furious. He waited for me to gain over a hundred pounds before telling me. Unfortunately, Seroquel is one of the few meds that I feel actually do something for me. So, since then lithium was added to my med mix and back on a low dose of Seroquel. Needless to say, I have been unable to shed the weight and feel like I'm a pound heavier every time I go to Dr. The gain in weight is what's triggering the blood sugar problems. I've also been on highest dose of Gabapentin for a long time now and don't feel that it is a contributing factor to my weight gain.",1

"I'm the fourth generation to have BP. No children for me I'm afraid. I have Borderline Personality Disorder too, so doubly bad. It wouldn't have been fair on the kids or my husband. He has enough to deal with, but we just celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary. I'm sure the pressure would have blown us apart. I borrow other people's children and spend all my money on us! It's great!!! Go with your instincts...you're an intelligent person.   ",1
"I was diagnosed at 14. I am now 27 and have 2 beautiful girls. While it is definitely on my mind and I am constantly on the watch for signs of mental illness... I am so very grateful for the love of my girls. I honestly contemplated suicide a few months ago... The only thing that kept me out of that dark place was the thought of them having to see me in a casket and asking why i would never wake up. I understand that they have a higher chance of developing the disorder since I have it, but I feel like I will be prepared to help them should they inherit it. I do fear for them... As any mother would. And I struggle with the ""what ifs"" and the guilt if they do develop it... But ""what if"" I worry about all this and nothing ever comes of it? They aren't guaranteed to get it   ",1
"No one in my family has bipolar or should I say no one has ever said they were bipolar ... I have a son who is 5 and a daughter on the way , I wasn't  diagnosed with bipolar until my son was 3 years old ... knowing what I know now and becoming educated on the disease I wasn't scared to have another !!",1

Those are considered to have many blurred lines. Multiple therapists and psychiatrist have said I have both with psychotic tendencies on many occasions. I quit going cuz I became even more confused.,1
Loved it cause it helped my anger issues and anxiety from my Bipolar but I gained 45 lbs fast. And I craved carbs.,1
I was on 5mg morning and 20mg at night but now I only need 10 mg at night. I was put on the stronger dose to deal with bipolar psychosis and now the voices stopped and I'm taking it to help to stabilise my mood and anxiety. I think it's great. The only side effect I have was on the stronger dose was drowsiness but I got used to it and on the smaller dose I don't feel groggy at all. My psychiatrist says it's hard to know which one of my drugs is making it hard to lose weight because they all can cause weight gain. All in all it's a drug that has caused the least amount of side effects. Remember though everyone is different.,1
I've been diagnosed bipolar 1 PTSD from domestic violence childhood also year ago march 8 three days after my 39th birthday my mother almost killed me with her honda CRV in the garage she's diabetic she can't feel her feet very well so that cause PTSD flashes and so on. I also know I have the neurosis which is the medical term for being neurotic I have shaking leg syndrome OCD for my hands being clean and i cross cut but i use hot water which I started doing in 2013. I found out at the age 39 last August that I'm bipolar im on Escitalopram/lexapro antidepressant 20mg a day and for the mood stabilizer I'm on DivaLproex extended release 2000mg a day. I'm having some dangerous driving problems eversense the garage accident I am driving a hundred miles an hour past an Illinois State Trooper what else every time someone purposely gets into slow me down I'll just go I don't care or they ride my ass at 75 80 miles an hour that will trigger me and I'll just take off going to commit suicide last year they gave me a hotline to call I did now I have insurance and I have help hopefully things will be better in a year sometimes I feel like I'm having a mini-stroke I'm just sitting there looking at picking up my controller play a video game but that I just stare at it and do nothing I was like my brain is just getting fried or freezes up or something everything that's going on right now with the law emotions my body I think it's just easier it's better just to say goodbye go take care of some things and then and then to go even though I know that's the depression talking it would solve the issue because well there's no cure for what I have that's a bunch of my impeccable long-term memory my short-term memory is terrible but I can remember my whole life just about and I'm not talking about special moments talking about most every day every week every month and every year of my life sometimes I think that I'm in hell and that's why all this shit this happening to me or that maybe we're in a computer see the world in this is a prison and we are all pieces of shit sent here to suffer because we were bad either way life sucks life sucks!!!!,1
It's easier to suffer in silence for me I get told off for speaking out bout how I feel or I'm told I'm wrong or I'm being silly.....literally smash my head off a wall sometimes n I get so mad I black out n swear n cry n break things.....i calm down relatively quick but it leaves me light head and rapid breathing.....swear I panic attack.....told it's anxiety I dunno I give up.....,1
Just sick of butterflies and worrying all the time x,1
"Or you have my psychologist - ""you're fine. It's just doubting yourself""",1
Definetly have 8 of these i used to be #1 when i was younger and i dont start any fights but people be bullying me and sometimes i have to defend myself verbally or physically but I've been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 since im more depressive and have major anxiety it really sucks and its hard for people to truly understand but i go day by day for my soon to be daughter and husband which im glad he is there for me physically and emotionally even though it can be difficult,1
10 out of 10 and more...the struggle is real.,1
Are you on any medication currently? I have found that certain tablets can cause very vivid upsetting dreams.,1
I too suffer from vivid dreams. I wake up sometimes with anxiety due to the dreams. I don't have any remedy just knowing I'm not alone in this made me feel better. Good luck to you.,1
Xanor helps me with my dreams it's for anxiety but makes me sleep and dreamlesa,1
I'm currently on Zoloft and it's also my first medication. So far I've noticed it helping my anxiety but having some breakthrough depression (can cry sometimes for no reason). I've had minimal side effects with it so I'm going to stick with it in hopes it works for me.,1
Most don't even have a clue unless someone they Love are affected and get to see the day to day struggle just to get out of bed and face the day first hand!!!!,1
"I might have to disagree with this one.  Depression is terrible and no one will argue that and until I got my diagnoses,  medication,  and subsequently my worst hypomanic episode yet,  I never would have said this.  Depression taught me exactly what I am afraid of and the mania has me face those ""fears"" without a second thought. I spent so many years hating the world and everything about myself that now I can turn even the worst of things into a joke and rarely let it bother me.  I even attribute a decent about of my life success to depression. All I ever thought was ""things have to get better,  this can't be how life always is"" so I just kept moving forward.  I tell everyone I'm crazy, I have no shame.",1

Dr's are passing that out like it's candy. Big pharma likey. I don't wear my heart on my sleeve, but I have lost a lot of friends and family due to my illness. It's not fun to be manic and out of control to only cycle to a depression that tears at your inner being. Hopeless and afraid. Don't shower or shave. Don't turn on my phone, staying inside my home...then I'm good again. The rollercoaster never ending. Heightened anxiety with fits of rage, here I am, in my cage. People scoff at me, thinking I'm fine...it's all in my head. Well, YEA! it is in my head! Intermittent Explosive. I'm sorry...always I'm sorry. It's my fault when it's not. I recede into my darkness and wallow in my mire.",1

Always being told,""You have a Great Life, so why are you so sad?""  I tried for years to explain things to them, but they seem like they could care less about my depression and anxiety!  I moved on December 26 and only 4 of my family members have been in touch.  I am very fortunate to have friends that care and support me.",1
Yep. If what's making you miserable is treatable with medicine.,1
Do you take propranonal for anxiety?,1

Me too. I have a problem with irritability when I'm manic. Not fun at all,1
"Been treated for depression anxiety and bipolar for awhile now. Meds and therapy have worked until recently. Seems like meds are working as well. I switched to a new med and it's been better. 

Both bipolar and BPD characteristics fit how I am.",1
It's common to have multiple diagnosis until you get one that actually fits. Essentially if the treatment is working go with it. I was diagnosed with depression borderline then finally bipolar and anxiety. Once I got my final diagnosis my meds and therapy helped things fall into place.,1
"I am bipolar. This is semantics, and everyone is too fucking sensitive about the words we choose. I don't ""have"" bipolar. It's not the flu. It's not acne. It's not something I can get rid of.

Except a bad case of irritation with sensitive little babies who are bothered by me using the wrong words.",1
"Interesting viewpoint.  I always say that I am autistic because I don't believe that autism is a disease, therefore I don't have it.  My entire existence is defined through my perceptions which are undoubtedly and thoroughly autistic.
I can totally see this viewpoint though.  BPD probably feels more like a disease, going by what people have said.  I wouldn't want to be defined by something that sounds so uncomfortable.",1
"O God yes. I started gaining on Zoloft, kept gaining on Lexapro and didn't stop until i started Wellbutrin. I've gained almost 45 pounds altogether. It's horrible",1
Effexor can give u adrenaline rushes i was put on neulactal to stop them just get regular blood pressure check ups,1
I didnt realise this was to high a dose my psychiatrist didnt say anything to me his even said i can take more if it continues not to work properly i have manic depression anxiety bipolar panick attacks any small incident can have me feeling really sad at times especially if someone is nasty to me as i was mentally abused my whole life,1

I used to be on effexor & smoked a bit of cannabis to help anxiety but had a heart attack & quit since they changed me to zoloft iv gone from 55 kilos to 76 i dont know if its because i quit cannabis or because they put me on zoloft . I couldnt stay on effexor because it makes ur heart beat very fast which i get tacky cardia already so could not take them anymore,1
Most depression anxiety and bipolar medicine will increase your  weight!,1
"I have been on it for 12 years and LOVE it!! I'm still on the starter dose of 37.5 which works for me and being hypersensitive to medication I understand your apprehension, give this one a try!!",1
You can get your meds. Pre. Packaged.  For morning noon evening and bed time. It costs me $9.00 a month to have that. And it makes things so less stressful.,1
"I don't recommend serequil. Way too may side effects. Effexor (venlafaxine) worked great also really helped with my severe anxiety. I had no adverse reaction. Take it, it helped me.",1
"Meds will affect people in different ways. It is a great idea to keep a journal when you start a new med to chart what is happening. That way you can let your doctor know of any severe side effects. And as I have stated before, Google Effexor and get all the info you can as well as all the info on all your meds. Keeping track of what has and hasn't worked is very important. As well as WHY you stopped a medication. I started Effexor in November and no one told me about the night sweats. 

I also got a cool med dispenser from Amazon that allows me to set up my meds for the week, but has individual containers labeled for each day. The container has little compartments for morning, noon, evening and bedtime meds. I adjusted it for when I need to take my meds and set an alarm on my phone. And it has worked out perfect. Almost no missed meds.",1
Have you thought of other alternative medicine like cannabis... I have depression and anxiety and it helps keep me calm,1
Best way i have found to remember to take my meds is to get get a box with the AM/PM if needed. and to put a alarm on your phone. something most people keep on them at all times now days. that way when you get the alarm you remember to either take your meds if you haven't or check to see if you have and since you have the convienant box you know if you have or not.,1
"I've always had the worst side effects with any of the anti depressants I've been on. The worst being suicidality. And I've tried them all...

My doctor has told me if I wanted to try any more I would need to do it as an inpatient in the psychiatric ward. Something I'm not keen on. 

As for remembering to take medication, if you set an alarm and have it at the same time every day, eventually your body will trigger its own alarm. Good luck and sending you lots of healing energy       ",1
All medications have some kind of side effects but everyone's experience is different. The medicines information leaflet will list all potential side effects according to severity and how common they are. Remember any antidepressant will take a good few weeks to produce benefit as you gradually increase dosage. I was on venlafaxine XL ( check if that what you have been prescribed as XL means it gradually releases rather than all at once) for many years with no issues but I was prescribed trazadone and had serious reaction to it and ended up having breakdown and in hospital similar to what you described. But I that is very rare. The withdrawal symptoms of Venlafaxine are brutal - even after missing one days dose  you will start to feel dreadful so if you are not good at remembering then venlafaxine is not ideal as it's best to try and take them at the same time each day. You could put reminders on you mobile. Choose times when you always do something and include taking your tablets.,1
I am also on medication to be taken twice a day. The best method I have found to help me remember is to take them at the same times everyday. I take mine at noon and midnight. I took Effexor 150 mg. It didn't help me. It caused me to experience extreme anxiety and irritability. These side effects were so severe that I almost lost my job. Hope this advice helps!,1
"Initially made me very tired but that wore off after a few weeks. I started out on 75mg, then was increased to 150mg and then 225mg. Psychiatrist wanted to up them further as he stated they work differently at a higher dose but I wasn't so keen on that idea. They did help my mood a little, but not enough for me to keep taking them. I had very few side effects from them. Each person is different though, so they're always worth trying. I struggle to remember to take my meds as well, so I sort them out into a weekly pill organiser and keep them next to to the bed. I drink a lot during the night, so my pills are by were I keep my drink and​ that way I tend to remember them. Good luck x",1
Cud she pm me just saying i found effexor no good for anxiety BT wif quetiapine i find it works well at both,1
I always set an alarm on my phone. plus my fiance reminds me,1
I agree if you have a cell phone with an alarm app use that. I have trouble remembering my evening and night meds so I have alarms set. Makes it a lot easier. Also I had venlafaxine and it worked well for me. It was one of the better ones for me but remember everyone is different.,1
"If you have a cell phone set the alarm on it to remind you to take your pills, you can set several different alarms for each time necessary.",1

Can you please post this anonymously for me. 

Best thing I ever did was get off Venlafaxine. (Under the guidance of a doctor!) 
I was a lot like you. Agoraphobic and had to have someone with me at all times. I had the paranoia about people looking at me and judging me. Depression, Anxiety, Panic Attacks and PTSD. 

Since changing meds in September, I'm back at TAFE two days a week. And thinking about going on a holiday. I've improved so much. I'm like a new person. 
I got a new shrink and a new GP. 
I'm now on 100 mg of Seroquel (Quetiapine) at night to help me sleep and take the Chase out of me. (In low doses it's apparently great for anxiety) and I'm on 200mg of Zoloft. 
I was on double that to begin with. (Both) but have since September halved it. 
I take a Valium at night to because I have restless legs. 

I've been on meds in the past that made me have suicidal thoughts. 

If it happens again tell someone ASAP.

"I have BPD and have been on Venlfaxine 
/Effexor for about 10yrs. Initially they helped with my depression but I'm not so sure now... I've been wanting to come off them for a while BUT my Dr advises the decrease will take at least 12mths to avoid withdrawal symptoms. 
Unfortunately what works for one person doesn't necessarily work for another. So even if I were to say Venlfaxine was great for my anxiety, they may not have the effect on you. Blessings.  ",1

It did help with the anxiety....,1
"The problem is that the two are linked. There are a number of mental illnesses which can lead to people drinking and becoming dependent. Some mental illnesses include self-sabotage, impulsivity, and risky behaviour as symptoms. Saying people have a choice is true, but you have to realise that not all people are weighing up the pros and cons the way a healthy person does because they can't make their brain function that way, not because they wont. They are less capable of making the correct choice because of their mental illnesses. If you havent resorted to self-medicating, great. I don't self medicate. I have self harmed as a coping method though, which is also a 'choice' but also a symptom of my mental illness. We need to see addiction as an illness because people cant get out of it on their own, because addiction can lead to expensive illnesses (cancer, liver damage, psychosis, depending what a person is addicted to), and because illness can lead to addiction (both self medicating with drink and drugs, and becoming addicted to prescription meds). It fits between illnesses and therefore has to be considered an illness. There needs to be support for addicts and  education to prevent addiction, and support for the families of addicts. Stigma stops people seeking help. It's no good asking people to stop stigmatising one illness if youre going to actively stigmatise another. Yes, addicts need to take some responsibility. Yes, they cause their families an indescribable amount of pain. But we cant breed stigma. We need to end stigma so that people seek help, help which might benefit them and provide a better future for their families.",1
"Thats the problem with addicts . Everything is about them . They take and they take and they take . Then they write these bullshit letters as part of their 12 steps to apologize for what they've done - let me tell you something . Thats for their benefit , not ours ! We get plunged into this guilt trip bullshit like we are just supposed to forgive them cause "" their sorry "" - you wanna make amends ? How about replacing all the property you destroyed ! Pay me back the money you owe me . So if your going to send me some bullshit letter that makes YOU feel better put a check in and maybe i will believe you",1

First make sure you ur as happy within urself as you can be gotta have inner peace. And you can't start nothing on messy foundation. Do things you enjoy, socialise with people so you can meet new people. Even join a dating site if you feel confident to do so. Treat it more though as getting to know new people and see how things develop, always take things slow get 2 know people stops things getting 2 intense and attachment that can lead you 2 get upset if people can't be the right person for you. I only spoke up cause though I don't know if I can ever have a stable relationship I do believe within my heart that the right person is out there for everyone it's just finding it, everyone broken in some way and we all have our floors it's just finding someone who can work with yours",1

I have been pretty stable for several years now, but I'm not going to lie, it's been a long hard road! I  hate my boys had to live through some of my worst times, but they love me and  understand now that they are older. But I still feel guilty for putting them through it!

"I say just go out and date and not get serious. Don't date thinking you must find a person to marry. Just have fun and meet people. You will soon find out who is understanding kind caring etc. when you think you have found that person or persons,  introduce them to bipolar and if they ask questions tell them the truth. It is possible to date with bipolar and you can find somebody. 27 is only young. Just don't go out there desperate to find someone. Go and have fun with it.",1

Don't be afraid of having kids too, I have two beautiful teen girls and they haven't exhibited any signs of bipolar disorder and if they do I will be here to help them with it. Also don't view yourself as broken, I tend to think of myself as just different and with a deficiency (I tend to think of my pills as a vitamin for the brain).

"Different for everyone. For me with depression and anxiety I noticed it was working after about a month on my depression. Honestly, it may have been a slight *contributor* to my anxiety (but to be fair, my anxiety meds werent helping either). Not on it now, but if my depression got bad I would be willing to try it again. And for women (idk if common or not) but my dr would have me increase dosage temporarily before cycling that month.",1
"I do not suffer from BP but a caretaker for a son that has it.  Also his older brother suffers from severe anxiety and depression.  We have all 3 been on Lexapro, I take it just for anxiety and the older brother has said it saved his life.  I get nauseous very easily but it has not effected to one bit.  But we have been told SSRIS should not be given to people with BP.",1
"Its different for everybody but Lexipro made me sleep almost all day every day. I had a headache and was dizzy but thats not why I slept. I physically just couldn't stay awake it was horrible. It helped with my depression in the sense that I didn't care about anything because I was asleep. I also gained weight, and I'm not sure how because I barely wanted to eat and only slept. I told my Dr I was done with it and wanted something else so he gave me zoloft yeah that did nothing. After about 3 months I stopped taking it. Now, 4 years later I'm on 200mg welbutrin twice a day and it works wonders for me. Everybody is different and what works for some wont work for others so just ""experiment"" with it, but if you're having any bad / suicidal thoughts while on the meds, please tell your doctor or someone that can get you help. ♡",1
Lexapro (escitalopram) is an ssri antidepressant that can also help associated anxiety. Like any medication it will take time to see full benefits as you increase dosage I would say about 2 months before full benefits start to show and gradually your generally depression and anxiety should lessen. Its not a drug that will immediately reduce anxiety.,1
"Lexapro did nothing for me in the end. Basically all the SSRIs do jack shit for me.
When I finally got to meet a proper doctor, I switched straight over to quetiapine.
It worked wonders for me, and really helps taking a low dose when anxious.
Unfortunately for me, it wasn't enough to hold me so now take lithium and quetiapine.
Good luck, every med works differently for each individual",1
It made me more depressed nauseated and restless legs real bad they switched me to celexa ive been on it 6 years now no problems. I hope it works for you.,1
"Took me only 3 days to get relief on it and start getting my life back. I feel like I crave sweets a
lot, some restless legs but not anything that keeps me up at night. Been on it over a decade. Everyone is so different the way we respond.",1
I take Lexapro for depression and Buspar for anxiety. Lexapro makes me tired so I take it at night.,1
No side effects for me. It helps my depression not my anxiety though,1
"I'm on lexipro, took about 8 weeks before i felt any difference, my doctor said the minimum people should be on it is 6 months, I plan to come off soon coz I have a horrible side effect of night sweats :( saturated having to change nearly every night   ",1
"Having BP II I can honestly say that every med is different and not always easy to adjust too. I hated Lexepro. I had horrible brain fuzz for the first week. Whenever you are trying a new med, patience is key. The side effects wear off after a few days. If they don't, maybe it's not the right med for you. There isn't one combo of meds that treats BP. Every treatment is as unique as the individuals brain being treated. What I can tolerate may not be tolerable for you. But if after a week, things are not feeling a little more manageable and after two weeks you're not adjusting then call your doctor!!!!!! Seriously. Sadly this illness is not a one size fits all. It truly is trial and error until you find the right dosage that works for you. Mine was no anti depressant and a smaller dose of seroquel and a big dose of therapy and don't he work. Patience.",1
you are right and its fucked up..i am in a 12 year year relationship and sex is important for a healthy relationship and its a struggle to keep that part i feel like i could live the rest of my life without it and im only 29,1
"Didn't notice it helped at all, dr switched me to celexa cant really say I feel that helping either, but I'm bipolar/ptsd/gad/panic attacks as well, so that might be why, I'm on other meds as well... sometimes wonder if any of them really work. I have good days and bad days seems like it's just gonna feel this way from now on. Not sure how I feel about that, but that's my two cents and then some. Best of luck to you. A good friend of mine swears by her lexapro and she has depression and mild anxiety.",1
"Depression and anxiety it usually helps. My son is bipolar, has depression and anxiety and he's never been anything but okay or not good on his meds. I just wish they could get the right combination.",1
Side effects for me was restless legs at night.,1
Getting off of it is horrible.,1
Sad but true. Also avoid any type of confrontation,1
Aj Kline and severe anxiety,1
I dont. Im a pretty responsible independent person. Without alarms.,1
I was on 800mg and i felt a lot better but i did gain weight! That got me down so i came off them. Wasn't good so put bk on them but now on 400mg. Still struggle with the weight but i can now function as a human being.,1
I've been on 100mg at night for 5 years now. It helps with racing thoughts and I sleep very well. When I feel mania coming on I take 25mg in the day and it helps. I have gained weight but not excessive. It does make you hungry. I take the generic called dopaquel which is a little cheaper. I was also afraid to take it at first. My phyciatrist prescribed it for me. Hope it works for you.,1
Did you have any trouble coming off it?? I'm desperate to get rid of it..,1
"I had sugar cravings for about 5 days on that dose and now my appetite is back down. I wouldn't worry about weight gain if it helps to balance you out. If tried   literally everything and saved, what I thought was the worst, Seroquel  for last",1
"They are both equally as important; significant weight gain is bad for the heart in the long run! I have severe RA ( Rheumatoid Arthiritis as well as Bipolar Disorder...RA markedly increaes your risk of Cardio Vascular Disease through various variables, probably the inflammatory nature of the disease is the biggest risk! Bipolar, in some studies, has also shown a correlation with heart disease...either through the illness itself, the meds or both...I reckon both but it may be heavily linked to the drugs that cause rapid & marked weight gain...and, associated type 2 Diabetes along with Metabolic Syndrome. This is not an option, for me, given the fact I find it hard to push to do basic exercises, never mind the intense exercise that would be needed to combat and mitigate these effects! Therefore, if this drug does indeed work for me, once I am stabilised I will, neverheless, be requesting a slow taper off of it, and then switch to another med, if needed...One that has much less risk of unatural weight gain, and metaboluc disturbances, given the very real risk potential of my physical illness! This is just my personal view on this drug; it is certainly not meant to scare or be a deciding factor for anyone else! People should be able to research it for themselves, and if they are then ok to go ahead with it, they  are then in the best place to make an individual decision based on their own experience of side effect/efficiency balance. Yet another reason that this drug may not be suitable for me, in the long term, is that, it can raise the hormone, Prolactin, which given the fact I have had bouts of PCOS in the past, is not a good thing! Kind Wishes to all; sometimes it's such a difficult and complicated road we have to travel living with this illness...♡¤♡",1
i avoid people and conversation because of that.,1
"Please try Lithium Oratate in small doses, exercise , mediate, avoid conflict, rest, good diet  and get into the WORD of GOD.",1
"This isn't about being exhausted. 

It's that feeling when you're so depressed you just do not want to life at all. You know you accept 100% "";"".  You will go on. But DAMN this sucks so fucking bad, even when I'm not dealing with this shit I'm thinking about it. My life will be hell for months. God please, can I just sleep through it. 

It's that desperation that this is talking about. I was there once, and I'll work a great deal to keep from being there again. 

;",1
Sleep is a natural response todepression and anxiety - do not feel guilty - just do it.,1
"Usually I get a response and stuff is posted, it's not usually like that to be avoided. But I noticed a change over the weekend too. I think admin also have disorders, so maybe someone had an emergency.",1
My posts don't get posted on here. When I'm in desperate need of people's good vibes. And admin don't answer.......,1
Thinking of you all! Stay strong and know you are not alone. There is no shame in reaching out. You ARE worth it <3,1
I hope so.  Nervous about this week and I have a bad cough.,1
WE ARE AFRAID TO LOOSE WHAT LITTLE WE HAVE CONTROL OVER MAYBE JUST GUESSING,1
"Bc of my bipolar I'm sarcastic and crude bc I lack a filter. I also lack empathy, I don't care how I make others feel...i also don't care how I come across. My co-workers know about my illness and NO one is bothered by me. However if they were, I wouldn't care...i stopped worrying about others view of me many years ago.",1
I'm the same. I'm not too bad at home but at work I find it really difficult and unbearable at times. I dont have any friends at work I get on with people fine but not developed into a friendship. I'm sure most of my colleagues think I'm a miserable moody cow when in fact I'm desperate to join in but my mind andoid is constantly going up and down.  Doesn't help being off sick several times over past few years. Sometimes I really wish i didn't work but i k ow this epilepsy mot be good for me as I'd just stay in the house.,1
"Your comments give me relief to this aspect of anxiety and gives me hope because i feel that although we feel pain from the social isolation we still persevere.
Thank you for sharing and caring. This gives me strength that does not necessarily comes from my medication.",1
"I follow this page because my son has been diagnosed Bipolar 1. I am also about to turn 50. I have 3 kids and one stepdaughter.  I have worked for a big corporate maritime services company for 10 years. I still have no idea what I want to do or be.  I wonder when I will be a grown up....

I don't think this is just about being bipolar or depressed or anxious. Just part of life. Try not to look for a pigeonhole to put yourself into. Just try to be kind to yourself and do what feels right and gets you through the day   ",1
"Thank you. My question exactly. I'm almost 40 and still cant figure out the answer & it seems no one can answer me either. People just keep telling me that I have the answer but seriously that's bullshit ( excuse my profanity) From what I have recently discovered,  being around people who suffer from ( or people who are willing to admit they have...) a mental illness truly brings the most joy, peace, & self worth out of all of us. I spent 30 days in an adult facility and felt the most alive and the most myself for the 1st and, apparently, the only time in my life.  Im once again lost. No drug, no therapy, no amount of money can compare to the unplugged, no judgment,  pure love you get amongst the diverse people who share our same life long struggles with mental illness of all types (different, yet the same) ♡ ;",1
"I live in a 10 by 12 tiny home, you can't put much in it, and I am happier than most people who have everything. God is my rock and helps me with my bi-polar because he helps me take the focus off me, my brain gets confused,my hearing very bad, when you ask God to help then read the bible for his answers to help you,and pray for motivation and the desire to do what he purpose for you,then write down thoughts of your prayers each day and act on them, you can see progress...but...you have to be willing to allow his help...if a person doesn't believe he exists, then this wont work.",1

"Find something or better yet, someone who can make you laugh uncontrollably.  Especially at the most inappropriate things.  I know this seems odd or insane to some but it seems to work for bipolar 1& 2, schizophrenia,  &BPD. The worst that can happen is a mood change. Even if only for a little while,  right ;)",1

"For me, simply being content is my ""happy"". It's not easy but it's worth the struggle.",1
"Wow that's a good one!  I'm sitting here today bored, depressed and lonely. Yet I have a ton of things I Need to do. 
But my depression and bipolar, anxious mind is making me sick.  I feel guilty for even thinking of having fun!!  Or any and everything I want to do will turn into a catastrophe!  But....I'm sober, and im not portraying any of the ugly symptoms of bipolar like I did 10 years ago.  With medication and counseling im better.  For that I'm happy.  Now to get off my butt and do laundry! Lol!",1
"Those admonitions place so much unnecessary pressure on people.  If a person does not already have mental illness, the anxiety and personal second guessing they create is detrimental, so if you do have mental illness, those admonitions are just that much more so.  I take them with a grain of salt. Making the most of life looks different for every person, and I believe contentment, which comes in many forms, is preferable to the often elusive ""happiness.""  Sometimes, just getting through the day is a huge success.",1
I can relate to this. Plus the added worry that what if I do the wrong thing.~Sandi~,1
"I am bipolar 1 as well. As for me,I usually only want to hurt myself even when I'm angry with others. The only exception is if I feel my wife or any of my family for that matter is being threatened. If you feel like you want to hurt yourself or anyone else and you're not sure you can stop yourself,please call law enforcement and cooperate with them. If you let them know on the phone that you are bipolar and you think it's due to your meds AND that you are UNARMED,they will treat you with compassion and sympathy. I hope this helps,I am speaking my opinion based on my experiences.",1
"I have bipolar I, severe with psychotic features. I've gotten so psychotic before that police had to get a switchblade knife out of my hands. Fortunately it was closed or they might have shot me. I was so paranoid and thought they were going to kill me. It was terrible. I seem to be doing well on my meds these days. Never miss a dose. Don't want to end up in jail again.",1
No it DOES NOT MEAN YR DANGEROUS. HOW HORRIBLE TO SAY THAT. YOUR MORE THAN LIKELY BE A DANGER TO YOURSELF THAN OTHERS. End of.,1
"My answer might not be popular, but Yes it absolutely can. You certainly can't put everyone in a box thou. Depending on how the person has learned to manage their disorder . Like if someone has a history of not taking their meds or is in denial of their disorder . Each person is different but unfortunately the ""mania"" is the irrational part that follows no logic.",1
Depends what stage they are in and what their situation is. I personally when elated am very irritable and have a short fuse. But in time u learn to control it more and more   ,1

"Hey all, I am a bit older and have been dealing with this my whole life- can I offer some insights? #1 we need to accept that we are different/special people. We are loners and leaders, innovators and dreamers. We have been trained by the capitalistic media and our culture that we must live in a house with a mate and work and be productive and not make waves. well, let me tell you that that will never work for you and you need to give up that fantasy. I decided to live alone and not involve myself in committed/romantic relationships about about ten years ago. I have never been as healthy and happy as I have been since then. Not having to worry about the pain you cause a significant other with you mood swings and all the other BS that goes with it is incredibly liberating. I instead find joy and purpose through helping others, especially young people. I have more friends than before. I have boundaries for my friendships to keep things less emotional. I now accept my craziness because it doesn't harm anyone. When I am unhealthy I keep people at a distance, when I am healthy I strengthen and create new ties. As people grow older, become more wise and mellow, I believe they can learn to embrace their unique neurochemistry and figure out how to use it for good. Good luck to you all.",1

"Try loving someone whose was soft, quite simple. Doesn't work. My husband of 18 years is rough, loud bullhead. We get along so well that in beginning he couldn't understand why I have frequent usually moods swings. So I had to tell him I was seeing and have mentel illness and appointment since I was a kid. So one day, he start coming with me to my doctor appointment and start asking questions about my illnesses then me. 
So over the years, my boyfriend became my husband, then he would let me know, my triggers when depression try to come on, understanding/point out what or who are the triggers or helping me calm myself when I lose it or bad episodes..
So me loving someone being bipolar, I have love that maniac. Loud rough like my husband Don but deep in his hearts he loves the me for me. And I'm bipolar, OCD anxiety, and PTSS as for being a hoarder of stuff.(clothes stuff animals and dishes)",1
"I totally relate to what you are feeling.  There is no easy solution, at least that I'm aware of.  I'm still fighting through a depression and anxiety that has left me disabled.

"I have suffered with severe chronic depression for almost 20 years. When I was at my lowest, I felt exactly like this. Individual therapy, group therapy, and the right medication helped me get out of that hole, but it took almost 5 years before I could see any semblance of my old self. Every single day is still a struggle but at least I feel as though it is worth fighting through. 
There are a few things I remind myself of daily - I will never be the happy, funny, outgoing girl I used to be, but that's okay because depression taught me how to empathize, forgive and accept; although I am lucky in many ways does not diminish the impact my depression has on my life; most people who make rude comments are just ignorant about mental illness, not intentionally mean or hurtful; being content can feel just as good or better than being happy;  and the fact that I am still here after struggling with depression for so many years is proof of my strength. 
I wish you the best in your journey.",1

"Is God accessible to the depressed?

God is so close to his depressed servants that it is as if he resided with the “crushed and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly ones and to revive the heart of the ones being crushed.” (Isaiah 57:15) How comforting to know that “God is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves”!—Psalm 34:18.

How can the depressed get comfort from God?

At any time of the day, God’s worshippers have approach to the “Hearer of prayer,” who can help us to cope with distressing feelings and circumstances. (Psalm 65:2) The Bible urges us to pour out our hearts to him: “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.”—Philippians 4:6, 7.                                                                                            

What if feelings of unworthiness make us think that our prayers are not being heard?

Depression may cause us to conclude that our attempts to please God are not adequate. However, our heavenly Father is sensitive to our fragile emotions, “remembering that we are dust.” (Psalm 103:14) Even if “our hearts may condemn us,” we can “persuade our hearts” that “God is greater than our hearts and knows all things.” (1 John 3:19, 20, footnote) Therefore, you can use expressions in your prayers that you glean from such Bible passages as Psalm 9:9, 10; 10:12, 14, 17; and 25:17.",1

I have been diagnosed with the same Bipolar 2 and Boarder Line Personality disorder. I don't tell people I know about it as I am afraid they will stop being my friend,1
This is amazing. I'm currently awaiting diagnosis but I can relate to so much of this. Thank you for posting this has helped me more then any of the stuff I've read. This will definitely help me explain things better to therapist. I feel like I am worthy of saving and getting better and you are to.

"Your not alone, there are so many people struggling, I have given up on help, as unfortunately I found the people I needed help from were in the wrong profession and I walked out numerous times, so so far I've found no one.

IM JUST NOW ACCEPTING MY DIAGNOSIS IM SAD AN ASHAMED I HAVE WASTED MY LIFE TO THIS,1
"I'd get anxiety from it, I know it.  And probably end up abusing it.  It'd keep me out of bed though, that's for sure.  Not a good choice for me.  I'm on Latuda, Neurontin, Valium and Ambien.  None of it is working very well.  I'm on the verge of losing it again.",1
I would wean off the Ambien and valium. They increase your risk of Alzheimer's by 60percent. They also affect short term memory.,1
"I was taking Adderal and loved it. Felt more awake, focused, just alive. However, it made me very anxious and I became severely manic after being on it for just a short time. I know it wasn't medication alone that made me manic, seeing as how I am diagnosed bipolar 1 And manic episodes are just part of illness. However, I experienced a state of mania I had never experienced while I was off of it.",1
Not good. I went crazy on it self harming 2-3 times a day. Couldnt function properly. My anxiety went through the roof. X,1
I taken ritaline its helps but not for my anxiety that somethimes kicks in,1
"No you should definitely not be started on alprazolam straight of the bat! Xanax either! My goodness these are serious medications. Unless your doctor is prescribing them in minute amounts, I'd be very cautious. Even 1mg of either of these drugs could be way too much for you to begin with & I've been on both of these at different stages. The best of the two for anxiety was alprazolam for me.",1
"I think I'm in 2 different discussions haha. Sorry. But my anxiety is so bad, I can't work, drive, associate with public etc. My Dr said I have to rely on clonazepam to get by for the rest of my life. I've tried everything non-narcotic. Does not work for me. Our bodies are different...",1
"Most anxiety medications are pretty tame Nadine. Maybe chat to your GP before making any decision. Personally, I can't live without my medications, the quality of life just doesn't exist unless I'm level.",1
I am bit scared the take medication  for it,1
You take meds for anxiety?,1
Never benzodiazepines!  This is like drinking 2 glasses of wine every day without the benefits of wine. Not good for the brain long-term. More then 150 days of benzos increase Alzheimer's risk by 60 percent,1
"I self medicated for years. Using drugs and alcohol to help slow me down then pick me up, only to find out I am bipolor plus a few more diagnosis at the ripe old age of 54. Yes it sucks and I feel I wasted so much of my life. Anyway, BUSPAR, for anxiety has been my saving grace. I am a recovering addict so, so many drugs mentioned just can't be prescribed for me. 15mg 3x daily and I'm good. Just thought I would throw this in the mix for those with possible addiction issues. Have a great day!  ",1
"Yes, you are definitely right Clarissa Anderson. I had to try so many meds to get my mood/anxiety right. It's a very hard struggle, but you can overcome it!",1
"Everyone reacts differently to medication. What works for you might not work for others. I was taking clonazepam and reacted badly. I'm now on buspar, seroquel xr, Zoloft, and tegretol, along with weekly counseling. This combo has definitely been helpful. I still struggle, but its no where near as severe as before. Its been about 2 years since I've been hospitalized or had a suicide attempt.  And it definitely helps to have a good psychiatrist that you feel you can work with and understands your issues.",1
"To be flat out honest with you I used to cope with my anxiety with alcohol. I didn't know what was wrong with me. I thought the worst. I went to the Dr and he said ""it sounds like anxiety"" and I was like ok. He prescribed me meds and I felt like a new person. Don't get me wrong I hate going to the Dr and having to pay a lot for my prescription but it's worth it!",1
"Pass is the same as clonazepam sorry had to research. We are in different countries. But yes I take ""paxam"" 1mg 3x daily for anxiety. Keep in mind is it very addictive and withdrawals. Just don't miss your Drs appt.",1
"No. Zeprexa won't kick the anxiety. Have you tried busbar? Or hydroxyzine? If your anxiety is as bad as mine like ""social anxiety"" phobias, fears, not wanting to leave the house due to you just plain freaking out you really need a benzodiazepine",1
Yeah zeprexa is strong. Definitely. But I take my meds at night and it stabilizes me through out the day. Along with my anxiety disorder I take clonazepam.,1
"I'm sorry. I know how you feel about having a hard time with a new Dr. I hate new doctors. You never know if they suck or not and then I have an extensive medical history from a TBI and many new draft have the magical fix they want to test on me. Then the first time I admitted I needed psych help, the medicine effected me poorly and the dr refused to listen so I had to go to the ER and once admitted I had to beg and plead until I found a nurse who would let me call my husband and let him know what was going on and so my kids could come see me before I was admitted. It took forever to find the right everything for psych. It's hard. I have BPD, OCD, and gad. Sometimes I'm hate myself as a mom too. I have one with a mental illness that has been a struggle for him and I sometimes wonder if he has the early signs of bpd and I worry about my younger ones and I worry I passed my mental and physical crap on to them (TBI was from a tumor). It freaking sucks when you want to die, want help, and help isn't there. Just take it one moment at a time. One moment. You can do it.",1
I'm in Sydney Australia and your experiences are all too familiar. I presented to er and I waited in their interview room for over 18 days only to be told if I'm asking for help I'm not at risk of suicide. I told them not to do a home visit because I didn't want to upset my father and well 10 days later they arrived on the doorstep on a day that I dragged myself to work in the hope of trying to drag myself out of my depression. They told my father everything breaking confidentiality and told him I was an attention seeker. Years later I called again because my psychiatrist was overseas for 8 weeks and I was told if I could afford. Psychiatrist I didn't need the public system and that was it. I'm now lucky to have a bipolar I diagnosis. I'm medicated correctly and I'm able to hold down a job which means I can afford private health insurance meaning I'm covered for a psych unit. People say our system is great and sure everyone is covered but there aren't enough resources to go around and the people running them don't have a clue. I really don't know what to say except I have some understanding. My suggestion is to find a new dr if you can. I understand your social phobia may stop that. What about a dr that visits your home? We have those in Sydney. Also ring the acute care again and say that you need to have a case worker and a referral to a psychologist. They might be happy to transfer you to case management. Gets you off their books. I really hope you can get some help soon. You are doing the best you can and that is all kids need to know.,1
There is if you don't even know what DBT is and/or have never been to DBT. Or were just recently diagnosed. There are a lot of factors. Your comment is not helpful. I had no idea what the hell was even wrong until a year ago because I was only diagnosed with anxiety and depression and didn't even know what BPD was until after a 10 day stay in the psych ward and a meeting with my psychiatrist. I haven't gotten to start DBT yet but I've looked some of the skills up and I'm trying. Not every therapist or psych Dr tells their patients about DBT though. Maybe think before you speak?,1
"Hhahahha.
Terkejut sekejap i. Bila memuler bukak

I can't relate.
Ahhaha.",1
I can't really comment as it's different here in UK - you can't just check yourself into hospital you really need to be ill and having been an inpatient many times often for long periods it's not a good environment. But if you feel you really struggling and really not coping with daily life if going into hospital is an option you shouldn't be ashamed or as if you letting people down . Care for yourself.,1
"When my psychologist suggested i should go to a clinic for bipolar depression and anxiety i was sceptical at first but things just got worst for me to the point where I would impulsively think of ways to kill myself but i went and it was the best thing i ever did. You have to do it for yourself because you can't be a good mother for your kids if you don't. Children are resilient  they bounce back quicker than you think...being sick is not your fault and you need to get to grips with that and you'll get  the assistance and proper medication you need to live a fuller life. I was ashamed about my sickness until I realised it's not my fault. Today I have the courage to tell people about my sickness and it doesn't bother them as much as i thought it would, they are more surprised and want to know more about it.",1
"I have a host of issues and on top of that i become suicidal at times, more frequent than I used to be. That said, no I don't go to the hospital because I'm afraid of them and last time the police made me go to the hospital,I spent the day on a Stretcher in the main hall with everyone going by me and staring at the crying lady with deep cuts on her arms and wrists, no phone, no way of trying to calm myself down and refocusing my mind. Id rather die first before going back there. I felt like a humiliated criminal for having a screwed up head.",1
"I've been inpatient. I will tell you this, speak to your doctor first. They will want to know where you are mentally. There is no shame going inpatient. You have to take care of yourself to be able to take care of your family. My medication was what caused my issue. A change to my medication and I was getting better. It's still been a long ride to finding a proper mix of medicine. 

If you are not feeling ok and are a danger to yourself or others don't hesitate to call your doctor or go to the Er",1
"Going inpatient can be a really good thing. I'm not ashamed to say I have checked myself in several times. If nothing else it gives a break from the day to day building of the ""real world"".  3 days rest from everything can give you the chance to recharge and refuel",1
"Go, you've probably done for everyone else. Its time to take care of you. I was admitted last year after my own struggles. It was the best thing i ever did for myself. Use the opportunity to learn about yourself and let someone take care of you. Dont let stigmas stop you from getting help you may desperately need.",1
Get help they need their momma . I was fearful of help till i realized how bad I needed it then I got help and doing alot better . ..,1
"If you aren't feeling ok, and feel like you're in need of help to the point of considering hospitalization, I recommend doing it. I spent a while researching places to go, and during that hesitation I did something that landed myself there anyway. I'd say go, there's a chance you won't be as lucky as I was.",1
"I take sertraline which covers both depression and anxiety, can't imagine being without half meds though Xx",1
Hang in there. The trials of attempting to find the right medications is a long and annoying but once your doctor and you have found the right combination its worth it. I have been seeking for over a year and only now am I getting close. But it was worth the struggle.,1
If you are frightened of hurting yourself go to an emergency room!! DONT GIVE UP. GET HELP. CALL 911 if you have to. Its ok. You willl be all right. You are loved. YOU ARE WORTH IT,1
Citalopram also called celexa is an antidepressant and can also help with OCD and anxiety. Any antipressant is hoping to take a good few weeks before you feel any benefit. It can be increased to recommended maximan daily dose of 40mg. Any medication can have side effects which you should find listed on the information leaflet.  However if you are showing symptoms of psychosis or bipolar disorder for instance these need to be diagnosed by a psychiatrist. Again if you not in UK system will be different.,1
"I was diagnosed Major Depression with Psychosis in 2011 - 2016. Five years I got Seroquel 200mg every night and it ruined my periods. The psychiatrist told me that I don't need meds any longer.   But, a year after that, I've become anxious and suspicious towards others. I believe that other people will hurt me, leave me, taking advantage of me, betray me, backtabbing me. Sometimes I talk gibberish, can't even make proper coherent sentence, acusing anyone else for creating such a plot to humiliate me, throwing & smashing things.  This April 2017, I was taken to a new psychiatrist because I was unable to live a day without being angry and suspicious. She gave me new meds : Merlopam® 2 (Lorazepam 2mg) Abilify®  (Aripiprazole 5 mg) Arkine® (Trihexyphenidyl HCl 2mg)  ...which I must drink at night before I sleep because the pills make me lose coordination between my mind and body. I can't walk or move in balance until the effect is wearing off.   To be honest, I HATE TAKING MEDS. I'm so sick of meds: pills, capsules, syrups. I used to drink meds since I was 5 years old for physical illness. And now, I have to take meds for my mental illness. It's like I spent the most years to take meds. But, I have to admit : I NEED IT. It's hard for me to simply admit that I need professional help. Better drinking meds than getting Electro Convulsive Therapy (ECT) once every 2 days, like when I was hospitalized in 2011. But when I did admit that I need help, everything seems to work in the right path.   I've just been taking new three meds I mentioned above for three days. It's hard to get back to the routine : drinking meds, after a year free of meds. I thought I could survive without meds, but the recent problematic events had made me depressed again. So, I have to admit it : I need help, I need meds, I need psychotherapy. I hope these will help, I hope someday I'll recover, and I wish you all the best too.   For now, I simply think this way : ""If I wanna survive without killing myself, I must take these meds, because my family and friends love me. Because they don't wanna lose me. I do this for them. I do this for me too, because I wanna save myself.""  Voila! I succeeded drinking meds. Yeay! Maybe now the meds haven't shown any progress just yet, but someday they would. Meds for mental illness need at least 3 months before I really feel the good effect. So, I will keep drinking these until I feel better, and I must believe that these pills will make me better. It takes time, but it's worth it, someday and somehow...",1
I just started citalopram too.. it takes time but most of the side effects should subside... make sure to avoid alcohol and caffeine,1
I'm all new to this too..but yeah I feel like this a lot of the time..I always question if my family love me care for me etc..it's a horrible feeling really it is..I'm on diff medication and lately my mood has been good very good..I've felt content so at the moment I would say I'm on the right dose..the tablets you are on made me feel sick also..and yeah they do sometimes make people worse to start off with..I don't take an antidepressant..but have had them in the past..you just have to keep going and stay strong eventually you will find the right medication etc just try to remember the voice is wrong your family love you and want to be there..it's very hard for ya family too as they don't really understand it properly mine right now don't either..keep ya head up and keep fighting you will win this xxx,1
"Also look into seraquil thats a mood disorder medicine and helps treat bipolar and anxiety its taken at night. The upside to the, is they work together and cymbalta once you get to 60mg it can also act as a pain medicine as well.",1
Look into cymbalta it works with both depression and anxiety.,1
You need to tell your dr your fears. They need to know and they can then help you. Be prepared to trial different meds. It took me around 18 mths before I found the right combo.,1
"I was hospitalized for a month last year - first time that had happened. I'm 41 with bipolar 2 and anxiety. I left my 3 kids with their dad. It was the best thing I ever did; before I went I was so unwell I nearly ended everything. Now I'm doing really well. 
Never be afraid to get the help you need. Screw the stigma, the people around you with brains and hearts will still be there when you get out xxxx",1
"Call - get appointment - talk freely with Dr. so he can know how to treat you - no need to worry...just do it - you will be so glad went.
Besides...everyone needs help from time to time.  Everyone!  (Some just refuse to admit it)
Been Bi-Polar since '92...have learned many coping skills & you will too.  God Bless You!",1
Go. It sounds like you need to. There's no shame in making sure you're well,1
Ask for help immediately. The dynamics in your household need to change so you feel and have less pressure.,1
"I know what your saying I live with unreality of life and I live for my husband and kids,when life gets hard talking to someone can dilute your feelings I think a therapist or someone who will let you just release your feelings your drowning in can help but when your down you don't see any other way but if your living for ppl then there's a reason to stay strong, I do it so my kids don't come to a place where I am even tho life can be so bloody hard you need to give yourself time and maybe seek medication just to take the edge off, I hope this has helped and that you find your way through what can be a horrible thing to live with take care x",1
"There is hope. You can change your life but you have to stop believing their world stops because of you. Although I'm sure you are important the world will not stop turning because you leave. I had a nervous breakdown feeling like this and the reality hit me when while I was hospitalized guess what? My kid survived, my husband stepped up and dang if no one starved or died without me. We put way more pressure on ourselves boxing ourselves into these roles WE create. This sense of panic and fear that stems more from our illness than from actual truth. Learn to say enough is enough and don't be afraid to ask for help. Their world is better because you're in it but it won't stop if you need your time too.",1
"It sounds like you're experiencing some anxiety. Instead of focusing on the positives, stop thinking about anything. Calm your mind by focusing on breathing--5 in, hold for 5, 5 out. Do this sitting or lying comfortably for 5-10 minutes.",1
"I'm like this. I'm fine until I start getting close to work, then my stomach aches and I get nauseous and sweaty. Im actually unemployed right now for that very reason. It's gets so bad sometimes that I just shut down and become a recluse. I'm medicated and I still have problems with my anxiety and depression. Like you, I try to focus on the positive and some days that works but the thoughts in my head and the feeling in my stomach takes over everything. It's debilitating and scary. But I just keep pushing on and trying my damnedest to stay positive for my family. Good luck and lots of prayers.",1
"The second time I attended therapy having being diagnosed with MDD + psychotic features the therapist said, I have so far displayed an emotional and dissociation disorder...when I asked him later during the weekly sessions he told me to continue taking my meds because they are not addictive and also commended me for my courage and consistency to attend therapy sessions...nonetheless the posts on this page has undoubtedly made me realise that I have BPD, looking back at the years , the ups and downs, feeling like a child despite all the birthdays passing by, pushing loved ones away and after longing for them , irrational fears, attachments issues, hypervigilant, teary, identify crisis etc...ooh and the biggie childhood abuse (incest). I am keeping well in the well of ups and downs through God's grace and strength.",1
"sadly, i have both, but on the bright side , i manage them well , mostly through avoidance..lol  i like living in my little bubble of lonliness, its safe here, there is pizza too!  I have bad days which can be very taxing and a trial of my strength, and then i have good days which remind me why i keep going.. thankfully i have some epic kids who make it all worthwhile and make me smile every time im with them =P i dont think i would cope without their presence in my life..",1
Shame I cant read it,1
"Every good thing takes time. I know how it feels like to stay at hospital. I used to get ECT once every 2 days. But finally I'm here, still alive, still breathing, still fighting against the voices, still struggling. Just because you're struggling, doesn't mean you're failing. Let's fight this voices together. Let it flow but don't give up. Never lose hope. I've been there and I survived. So will you.",1
I'm recovering as well and I journal all my worries for the day and then tear them up and throw them away. Then I meditate for 10 minutes. It has really helped me.,1
People don't let it get to that black whole of nothingness do something about it don't be ashamed it's not your fault,1
You don't say what your GF been diagnosed with but from what you have written sounds like Bipolar. Difficult situation. If you think children are at risk or in danger then you need to do what is best for them to ensure they ate safe.  You can either let her know you love her and are there to support her if that is what you want and that you will be there if and when things go wrong. Or you can decide to make the break. Unfortunately only you can make that decision.  Sounds like it's time to really think what us best for the future of your children.,1
There isn't any specific medication that treats BPD so any meds she will have been would have been for depression anxiety which can result in consequence of having BPD or a mood stabaliser if she also as bipolar disorder.  You dont say what she was on / stopped. CBT especially DBT is very helpful for BPD sufferers. However  her behaviour may not be a consequence of any of above. Cheating or having affairs or abusing another person does not equal having a mental health illnesse. I  would  sit dowm and speak honestly together about your relationship. It maybe that it is over.,1
"I genuinely don't know how else to say this. If a person is taking the wrong meds/no meds at all their ability to think clearly and make good decisions can disappear. If you let her hit rock bottom- how will she know she's wrong if she can't control her brain? She's the mother of your children, she deserves more respect. She's always going to be in your life and so is her mental illness.
Think of it this way- if one of your kids develops a mental illness, which is possible due to genetics, how would you feel if they were clearly not well and making bad decisions and (God forbid) their long time significant other took the kids and ran? I highly doubt you'd support or respect that. 
Right now, your kids see what's going on. They might not understand it, but they see it. No amount of good parenting will hide that. Do it for them, because they deserve a healthy mom.",1
"Many youth services organizations have positions that require only a hs diploma or GED. You would mentor and plan activities for at risk kids, one on one. Some college or X yrs experience in the field is usually required. No degree tho",1
Alarm clock got wood?,1
"Don't be afraid to ask for help,it's okay! Take a day at a time. I hope you get the help you need.",1
I tried your way Jenny Franklin and I tried to Commit Suicide twice.  Always with a smile on my face saying that thinking positive and surrounding myself with positive thinkers.  I ate the right foods that would help me have a clear mind and energy to live.  It all failed.  Twice.  Not everyone can cope without intervention of medicine and therapy from good people.  If They hadn't talked some sense into me about what I was doing to myself I wouldn't be here.  I'm dealing with a loss in my family right now and this is the first time ever that I haven't had a complete meltdown.  I feel strong and I can be strong for my kids.  They lost their dad's sister to cancer and they need me to be Mom....not a hysterical puddle of panic attacks and mood swings.,1
I was so sick and scared a few weeks back and i called a crisis hotline and talked to some one and they got me help with in mins they will send you where they can get you some help,1
"Oh sweetie I hear you so I have tried this and it seemed to help: bubbles. Buy some bubbles or make your own(super easy) and blow your worries away or blow them out and pop them ""pow!""",1
I UNDERSTAND i have ocd depression anxiety pstd bipolar since i was 5 and i am 55 now i have been through HELL i dont meds anymore they dont work but i see a Psy doctor and i have started natural items and vits and stones and crystals medatation Prayer and walks i just started all this new stuff a few months ago cause meds dont work for me and i just turned 55 and i am tried of the old life i was living it wasnt working out so well  GOOD LUCK TO YOU,1
I have just about all these symptoms since I was about 12. Now I am understanding that maybe my poor concentration and memory loss is because of ptsd. Shit sucks and it's the one thing I am most insecure about.,1
"Wow this is me to a T, but I've been told it's just depression and anxiety disorder..... I knew it was so much more then that",1
I can relate to almost everything listed. I've been diagnosed with ptsd aboutt 20 years ago.  Everyday is a new adventure.  Everyday a different struggle.,1
Understand all to well I have PSTD and OCD and just found out a few weeks ago i have Bipolar 2 and the meds i was taking for OCD is poison to take  for people with bipolar :( i have been sick and begging for help for a few years couldnt understand what was going on thought i was going Crazy I scared myself so bad i called crisis hotline and they got me in with in mins and talked to me and HELPED :) its not gone but i feel better and working oon getting well,1
This pretty much describes me. Am I in denial about why I have depression/bipolar. I really should probably seek help but there to I am afraid.,1
"This whole list (apart from 2) sums me but doctors say I just have bad depression and anxiety, could that be the case?",1
The list is complete and the struggle is real.,1
"Totally understand...
I feel like I have lost my life; I have lost my career, my finances, my identity, my role in life, the very essence of who I was born to be... 
I have lost relationships as I struggle to get out of the house and commune with others. My youngest [adult] child has moved out so now I live alone with my little dog & two cats for company.
I sleep on the lounge as I'm awake all night in front of the television then sleep all day which suits me better than having to endure the long hours of the day. 
I waver between deep dark in the hole depression & a more moderate but just as debilitating mood. I frequently spend time thinking about suicide to the point of planning my own funeral. The only thing that really keeps me going is a healthy fear of God - we all have an 'appointed time' to die & ultimately it's God's decision when that is.
Living with BPD & other mood disorders is mentally, physically & spiritually exhausting. 
I grieve & long for the woman I used to be.",1
"I am a fellow Soldier in this battle, unlike a lot of people who comment.

Day in, and day out, I fight & deal with dark thoughts, lack of motivation, fatigue, stress, anxiety....  and now, I have recently discovered the possibility that I may also be dealing with PTSD as well.

Regardless, I have no other option, but to fight it out.  I don't have insurance; the few times that I have gone to the doctor regarding this crap, all it's accomplished is costing me money, without resolution.

The doctor wants me in therapy for a year, BEFORE we investigate medication alternatives.  The Counselors that I have visited with want to talk about the trite & trivial issues de Jour, instead of giving ideas or suggestions as to workable solutions.

I know, all too well, what Hell this fight IS.  Yet, when I share what I am doing, people here argue about the Natural Solutions.

Depression is an ugly thing, but with it are many valuable lessons.  Those of us who are NOT 'cherry', KNOW.  We can tell when a person is complaining because whining is the only attention they get, or when a person is pouring out the B-S, just to get the Drugs.

I wish you the best in solving this problem, if that is REALLY what you want.",1
"Sounds like your good at pushing yourself away - from life. Yes depression is around you but so is your head full of negativity and over thinking, and pretty soon you'll just be in an ugly spin not even you can control. It won't be about whether you pray or who you push away, your head will win and you'll be paranoid at best. Is that what you want? While you've got the strength you've got to fight for yourself and your little life - it's worth something - and quit playing games with people. Be honest. Be the best part of you. So get of bed and do stuff!",1
I'm not the one to upset today,1
i know someone who takes it and struggles not to sleep all day. been that way for 6+mo,1
Yes it was supposed to be for my anxiety and panic attacks and my Latuda for bipolar mood swings.  I'm am stable and happy.,1
"It would be amusing if it wasn't so ignorant.

No everything's fine now, i only get suicidal thoughts every other day now, im cured!             

..... Depression is horrific because theres no pill to cure it, its a lifelong struggle, its as if your brain is waging war against itself and your stuck in the middle of the trenches. 

Some days are okay, others are filled with self-hatred, monsoons of tears and the need to quit my life and an urge to cave my own skull in with a hammer.

Snap out of it is something you hear all the time.....
 trust me....a sane, healthy individual WOULDN'T live this hell for 7 years BY CHOICE! 

One day it would be nice for me to explain this to someone and for them not to look at me in horror like im some kind of leper.",1
"It's not that easy and you add to the stigma by saying stuff like this. Many folks don't get the proper help and struggle to accept they need meds, please don't make it harder on fellow sick folks.",1
"I know my bipolar, both on and off of meds. I prefer being on them. I am less terrified of life. I'm glad that you can live off of them.... But I surely can't, and believe me, I've tried.",1
Latuda left me feeling lathargic most days but I wasn't irritable at least. I hope it works well for you.,1
"I'm on 200mg of Lamictal.  It's the only thing that seems to give me at least a little relief.  I've not had good luck with antipsychotics in the past so I'm reluctant to try Latuda.  

I google EVERYTHING about medications before I take them.  The trick is to stick to and understand the science side of things and give very little weight to the anecdotal side of things.  

It has also been my experience that the vast majority of general practitioners are not up on the latest research and very few like to listen to the patient's knowledge and/or research.  For example, my doc had no clue at all that the only 2 mood stabilizers that are truly effective for bipolar depression are Lamictal and Lithium.  The rest of them are more effective for mania/hypomania.  But at least I'm lucky enough that she realizes I have 30+ years dealing with bipolar and I know more about it than she does.",1
I stopped worrying till symptoms appeared .,1
"I had to use google before I could start taking meds. Although there is the rash worry, there weren't many other side effects that I would be worried about. The ratio of help was potentially better, I was really surprised!",1
"I tried going off meds as I don't like having to rely on all these tablets. It was quite honestly the worst decision I have ever made in my life! All was well initially and then things would upset me, then smaller things upset me more and so on and so on. In the end, I ended up in such a bad place I tried to end it all. I spent 3 days in ICU. Now, I religiously take my medication, even when they're not right for me. I keep regular appointments with my psych team and 2 years on, although my meds are still not right, I'm in a much better place than I was without them.",1
"Bipolar is bipolar. So yep you can be bipolar without taking meds. I would never not take my meds because I know I am bipolar and have no desire to have episodes like I can have without my meds. We will ALWAYS be bipolar there's no cure, but meds can help with the horrible episodes. Helps me recognize I am falling into one.",1
I am confused as to what you are asking?,1
"Julie Michelle Gray I have done it without meds and it made me miserable. I hated life. Couldn't enjoy anything. But mine is not just bipolar. I have PTSD, depression, anxiety, bipolar and adhd. So yes I am medicated. Better than be sucidial.",1
"Ooo I should know better. We are all entitled to our own experience and that is mine. I am not the only one who does this every single day, regardless of what my bipolar tells me I'm capable of. The bipolar is not the boss of me. I'm the boss of it. I don't allow myself to stay in bed no matter how much I want to. I keep my irrational temper to myself because I know intellectually I'm being irrational. I very clearly see what the bipolar is doing to me and I fight it, tooth and nail, every second of every day. And when I get tired and want to give up, I put on my big boy pants and move on. So go ahead and judge me.",1
"Yes, I got off the meds gradually, now take chamomile capsules for anxiety, a brain supplement for brain health, a multi-vitamin, and eat a pure diet of proteins, greens, nuts, coconut oil, green tea, some V8, balancing the chemicals out, and exercise, your body will fight to learn how to balance the chemicals.",1
"I actually follow a very similar regimen as you and I find it works for me. It  helps me deal with my symptoms without being medicated. However, I stay on a very strict diet and exercise regime and it helps for me to have regular contact with a therapist. Unfortunately however, I have not been able to find a therapist so I've been cycling more due to life stresses, but I hope to be back on track soon. The ups and downs still happen, I've had to do a lot of work in therapy groups and individually to learn coping skills to try to deescalate myself before I rev up to full on Mania or severe depression. Best of luck to all!",1
"I was diagnosed in 2015....I was on Lamictal for a while but stopped due to side effects ...Have not taken any thing since .

I can't even say it gave me my life ""back"" because for as long as I can remember, internally I was out of control and cycled between deep depressions to hypomanic irritable episodes every couple of weeks.

I am not saying you can't live unmedicated, but your reasoning should be balanced against what type of quality of life you have medicated vs unmedicated.  Best of luck.",1

I  always thought of my diagnosis and all the hospitalizations and loosing contact with all my friends and alot of my family that me being bipolar with anxiety was a curse. That god was punishing me.  I no longer feel that way because everything that i struggled through made me stronger, brave, courageous and i can relate to others who have also struggled.

Seroquel makes my Restless Leg syndrome unbearable and I Also have an Anxiety disorder...thinkin' about whether I can get some sleep makes it Worse.       ,1

"It's been a year since the last pill I took. Now I face another form of mental illness. Why, God, why? I know why, I just wanna say ""why"". If anyone offers me to change who I am, to get a new different life with a new identity as a human being, I pass. No, thank you. I know it's hard to live like this, especially when those people who don't understand what you're going through keep bullying you. But, I won't exchange me, my life, my struggle, with anything else. No matter how bad it is, how hard it is, I'm here and I'm still alive. And that's enough. I don't think anyone else can be as strong as I am today. So, I'll live... I'll do whatever it takes to stay alive.",1
No one should feel guilty for that.,1
Depression is hard really hard but when you have over active mind and brain which is powerful generator of thought and so anxiety you feel like you run so much so fast that you are dying from exhaustion but still are ruining! it is just....,1

Good question but I am afraid there is no good answer for this...,1
"Everyone should be saying, ALIVE! You're here today still fighting and battling. No bell rang yet. If you've been battling as many years I have. Since I was 22. I'm 46 now still have terrible days. I mean scary. Hearing voices seeing things thinking someone is watching me or following me. It is scary very scary. I'll never get rid of this illness/disease. I take Everyday like its my last. Hope everything works out. #LiveLoveLaugh",1
I have alarms set in my phone so I never forget my meds. If that fIls I have a routine. Breakfast the get dressed and take my meds which are beside my bed with a bottle of water then at night I get changed for bed and take my tablets. I take them the same time every day so the routine is pretty much set in stone but the phone alarm is the key to getting a routine started. And it's important to take meds at the same time everyday so you maintain consistent concentrations.,1
"Horrible, I was spaced out, driving erratic. Did nothing",1
Tried it became very irritable and angry worse than I already was my psychiatrist said that Zoloft is not recommended for people who are bipolar,1
"I had Zoloft and heard voices and screaming on my ear, especially when I was trying to sleep. I also used to see shadows and things flying. Horrible...",1
I was on Zoloft all of the dosage and it just made me worst the side effects of it is horrible I ended up in the hospital cause of the bad thoughts and before I could start a new medication i had to let Zoloft out of my system so the withdrawal was horrible as well i was so sick I couldn't move cause of the withdrawal I don't recommend zoloft to noone I don't like it,1
I'm on 50 mg now. I started zoloft to help my anxiety and panic attacks and I was trying to get pregnant so zoloft was all I could safely take. I'm 33 weeks pregnant still on it. It helped me a ton. I've had maybe 1 panic attack since starting it my anxiety is calmed even my depression is less. I'm not getting as many nightmares and flashbacks now. I'm more likely to go out of the house and do stuff now. I'm hoping being on it now will help stave off post partum depression but my doctor is prepared just in case it still happens.,1
I just started it a week ago I'm taking it for bad anxiety I really hope it wirks,1
It stopped working for me. The initial side effects were horrible,1
"Yeah, it's scary as hell! I will NEVER ever let them prescribe that, and that happened like 15 years ago",1
"Hi im on 300 mg of zoloft it took a good 2 yrs to work properly & i still have bad days im also on neulactil for anxiety & high  adrenalin i used to be on effexor slow release tablet but i had to stop them due to having heart attack & effexor make ur heart beat fast which my heart could not handle anymore cos i get tacky cardia & angina i dont think theres a tablet out there that will fix depression  completly , hey i could be wronge",1
"Didn't do much of anything for me, but was the absolute worst to come off of. I lost 30 pounds because I was so sick I couldn't eat anything. Vertigo was absolutely horrid. Just an awful experience all around.",1
It sent me into a dark mania and I was suicidal. Terrifying time.,1
"They wonder why every high profile massacre has a person with a mental disease. No one listens to us. They have no idea what a panic attack is, on top of withdrawal feels like. They could not imagine. Learned recently if i miss 3 appts with my doc he will not see me any more. Sad",1
"I totally understand I remember before I had meds. Used to be full of pain scared of the chest, called panitc attack. Pain caused anger. People would say pray, but I never felt much relief. It is a mental problem.",1
"I struggle with Rapid cycling bipolar disorder, post tramatic stress disorder, Body dysmorphic disorder and anxiety and i haven't been on any medicine for an entire year! It has been so hard for me to make it through the months. It is physically and mentally draining. I ended up in the hospital two times in 5 months for suicidal attemps and self harm. I know its hard right now, but we will get through it! If i can make it through than you can too! It might seem dark at times but there is a light at the end of the tunnel! There is a quote that always keeps me going, ""Suicide doesn't end the pain, it just passess it on to someone else"" Message me if you need anything!",1
I'm sure this is helpful and interesting but my anxiety can't take it! Oh the irony!,1
"Im watching it right now, half way true. I do notice that it triggers my depression. (I have bordeline and alot of trust issues with men, which plays a big part in the show due to being sexualized / rape etc )
So I watch it in my own pass and take days in between episode so it's not overwhelming.",1
I won't watch it out of fear it will trigger me. Not worth the risk.,1
"Dosage may be to high. Lithium when husband was on it he could not drink soda. And they would do Blood work every two weeks to ensure his levels were not too high. You can actually get lithium poison if not monitored and can make you feel worse.  He only was able to drink Gatorade,water, and ginger ale. Zoloft is hit or miss but I would ask them to reduce the dosage to 25 and add hydroxizine tartate for sleep and anxiety attacks. Wellbutrin  stay far far away because that shit don't work and makes you feel more suicidal at best. Lithium I don't recommend because my husband was on it and killed himself. I just say the amount he was on was high in correlation between other medications. He took it for epilepsy and bipolar disorder. But I would ask for the 25 mg of Zoloft. Clonzapam works wonders but most doctors will not prescribe it due to being a narcotic.",1
I went out and didn't spend the whole of the next day worrying about what I said,1

I was highly allergic. Made my anxiety worse and slurred speech. Sent me back to the hospital more than once. Dr said to stop taking it immediately.,1
"I was on .25 mgs for about three weeks and we quit it. I had an almost six week withdrawal from it. It's still going on. Im very spaced out, I keep having awful panic attacks, and I can't concentrate on anything. I also keep getting extremely confused. It's awful. I hate it.",1
I was incredibly paranoid on it had to be taken off quickly,1
"Ive been in your situation before...it is horrible! This is legit, try Goodrx.com, or they have an app...you can get HUGE discounts on your meds! I had to use it a few times, especially for my Effexor, I could go without the others, but damn, I felt like I was dying without the Effexor. Ended up I only had to pay $12 out of pocket for my script! It's worth a shot. You can enter your meds, and then it gives you pricing at your local pharmacies...you just go in, show them your phone with your ""card/member"" number that goodrx gives you, and you get the meds for that price!",1

For me personally it was terrible. I felt much much worse. My anxiety went up and i was tired all the time.,1
"I take 225 mg of Venlafaxine daily for depression/anxiety and it has worked the best for me. I also take it with Riperidol, which is a mood stabilizer. I have never felt better. But you also have to go to therapy while taking it. It is not a miracle pill. The two together is a great mix for me.",1
"I've personally never had insomnia from it. I now take Seroquel at night to help with a long term problem with staying asleep. The best ever med for anxiety for me has been busparone. It worked so well it changed my life. I take Lamectal (lamotrigine) to stabilizer so my behavior doesn't get extreme, venlafaxine as an antidepressant, and Busparone for anxiety. Took me about six weeks to get them all to level out. I had fatigue, headaches, and swinging moods but they have pretty much been resolved. You must stick with it for 4-6 weeks.",1
I have been on it forever. Definetly helps with deppression. The only bad thing is now i cant get off to try anything new because the withdrawl is horrible,1
Vemladaxine is antidepressant and not aware it has particularly beneficial sedative side effects.  Venlafaxine is one of the drugs I took for many years for depression / anxiety and like any of these drugs you can feel worse initially because it is helping your brain function  Warning though do not miss a dosage withdrawal symptoms are horrendous and i mean horrendous.,1
"Been at my psychiatrist today........he says (after 20+ years bipolar diagnosis) that I have "" Unstable Personality Disorder"". Can you tell me what this means in relation to PIP? I haven't got  the letter yet and am really confused as it seemingly encompasses Disacociative Disorder with non epileptic episodes/blackouts, due to which I've had to surrender my driving licence. Help!!!!!!!",1
"Never heard that before,interesting. I take medication for depression and anxiety. I try mindfulness,but it doesn't work well for me.",1
It's a good place to start but my depression and anxiety can be rooted in the present as well. Sometimes more so.,1

"Right? I had panic attacks for 10 years for no reason, and 3 years ago diagnosed with GAD and bipolar 2. Mine comes out of nowhere Dr said it's a chemical imbalance for me not brought on by environmental factors. Just gotta wait it out until my body regulates. I take medication for anxiety but nothing for depression. Haven't had an episode in 2 years hoping I never do again. I don't like taking meds and so far every cocktail they've tried on me I've had horrible reactions to.",1
I have bipolar I and anxiety which are treated with medication. I also use therapy because medication can only do so much for me. It's a balancing act and it's hard work. It would be nice to be able to take a pill and be done with it lol,1
Thank you for posting on my post! I'm just so nervous. The last time I was put on anything was Zoloft & it pretty much made me almost kill myself! It gave me horrible thoughts.,1
"Each person responds differently to meds so keep that in mind. 

I've been on it for nearing 2 years. When first taking it I felt miserable from the side effects but it didn't last long.",1
"Sorry,posted before I finished writing!
I know they are very expensive to prescribe,that is why  they are not given out until you have tried other medication.
They honestly are really good.
I have not have any problems with them except when I started taking them.
Even then it was just getting used to them.
I have been on them for several years now,but from how I am feeling now,I know they work.
My GP did tell me that if & when I reduce the dosage,it should be in the summer & not when it's bad weather. He said the winter can make people with depression/anxiety feel low anyway.
I really hope these work for you Gabrielle xx",1
"They do work for a little while, anxiety subsides and generally lift mood. Downside, which docs failed to mention to me, extremely addictive, and once on them extremely difficult to ever come off. I went cold turkey and it was horrendous, they have one of the lowest half lifes of all the anti depressants.try going on some forums, what I done and you will generally get the same as what I'm saying. I've never felt better since been off them, not saying  they don't work, but it could be a long term commitment once they in your system",1
Not sure what meds you're on but you do need an anti psychotic to stop the paranoia and high anxiety. It's the only base type of drug that works.,1
"I am the same way   . I'm not confused tho, it's what my bipolar/ anxiety issues do to me. I do ask myself did I take my meds, when did I last sleep. Hope you are on meds and they are working for you. If not go see a doctor or psychiatrist and get on a regiment, that's trail and error but you can do it. Be kind to yourself and mindful of your patterns mentally, awareness of your  mental state truly helps. I tell myself, stop and listen, breathe and smile   . Keep on keeping on. We're always here.",1
Aye....what if u have both....constant struggle for me  ,1
"My personal opinion is that this chart gives a poor description of both. It uses professional terms that a lot of people don't know the meaning or understand. I also find it interesting that under bipolar it says episode of mania (term a lot of people don't know or understand) associated with euphoria (again - what's that?) and depression, and under BPD it says mood (inaccurate information - BPD is not a mood disorder, it's a personality disorder) changes including irritability, sadness, feelings of emptiness and anxiety. Those are all symptoms of depression and seen in mania. And where are they measuring if it's a personality problem, situational, mood, or something else. BPD is most problems due to relationships and how one views the world, which this chart says nothing. This chart has too many wholes in leaving one still confused. I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and Generalized Anxiety more than 10 years ago. It was very clear I was manic and depressed, and anxious most of the time but continued to have other problems that were untreated and not symptoms of bipolar or anxiety. Last summer when I went to the hospital was finally diagnosed with BPD. It didn't take away the other diagnosis I had, was a third disorder. It's sad that it took so long and of all people, wasn't even a dr to find the problem. Nurse mentioned it before I ever saw the dr based on our interactions. And after spending hours with the dr talking about what was going on and what had happened for years, dr confirmed. And not to mention Bipolar is treatable with a combination of medication and counseling techniques, BPD is only treatable with therapy and from what I've been told only thing that works is Dialectic Behavior Therapy.",1
"Jo, I was wondering the same thing. I've always struggled with the right meds for Bipolar over 10 years and when I went to the hospital last year they told me I have BPD. I'm still not being treated for it because meds don't treat it and I can't get DBT.",1
the way my mental health nurse explained it to me having bpd is like bp but its having a months worth of ups downs and switch feeling is 1 day which is why it is so dangerous but treatment is very similar i was misdiagnoses with bp for years and i kept saying they were wrong now i have a real diagnosis and they can see why i struggle in a day as i don't no how i feel from 1 min to the next people don't no enough about bpd and i have been treated aporlingly by medical professionals sick of judgment now i have a supportive mental health team and i finally think i have a chance to get better not just for me but my children,1
Yeah it says bipolar isn't related to life events. But when life events get crazy which eventually they always do all hell breaks loose. And as someone who has bipolar you definitely can have the irritability and sadness and anxiety because you're a fucking person not just a set of clinical symptoms,1
IT REALLY ALL MAKES PERFECT SINCE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT NOW THATS REASON TO BE PARANOID,1
I often think maybe I might have borderline personality disorder instead of having bipolar disorder. I rarely have hypomania and euphoric episodes. I get irritated easily and often feel very anxious. Doctors are constantly misdiagnosing patients.,1
With bpd sometimes medication isn't helpful you can have it to help with the anxiety & depression with it but the actual illness is about learning coping strategies and dbt therapy.  ~Sandi~,1
O I wish I had the book now it sounds so good it's a shame that I don't have anyone in my hometown I can talk to when I'm feeling low but it's nice talking to you Bambi Stell you sound like a lovely person   ,1
"Don't listen to people that know nothing about the illness. I can understand how you feel like you aren't yourself it's like your can't control your thoughts or emotions, my daughter suffers bpd, so I see her struggling every day. You need to find a good psychologist that specialises in mood disorders and does dbt therapy. Medication can help but not always.~Sandi~",1
"I'm sorry for your loss. I lost my mum to cancer 10 yrs ago. Does it get easier? Yes and no. I had a love hate relationship with my mum and one of my greatest regrets is having an argument with her in hospital and it was the last time she was able to speak. There are always times when vulnerable like when I am sick, in trouble needing advice etc where it seems worse but then on my good days I'll find myself think about good times. It will always have an affect on you but it's how you choose to remember that's important. Think about grief counselling. It helps.",1
Thank you so much. I have a diagnosis of depression and anxiety. I basically sit and wait for my next anxiety/ panic attack,1
"I was highly allergic. Made my anxiety much worse, slurred speech, and sent me back to the hospital more than once.",1
I would check your diagnosis as suggested by others to confirm if you are BP1 or 2 (from what you said sounds like BP2 when depressive episodes more frequent and hypomania episodes rather than mania    or have BPD. You could have cooccurring diagnosis such as anxiety depression compulisive behaviour etc which meds can help or you,1
"A therapeutic dosage for some people is 200mg. For other people it can be as high as 400mg a day. Try not to be freaked out by all the side effects mentioned. Yet, if you notice anything unusual. Tell your dr immediately. 
I'm wondering if some of you are mistaking this drug for an anti-depressant.
Lamictal is used as a mood stabilizer in psychology. If a bipolar person takes an anti-depressant without taking a mood stabilizer. It'll cause a manic/hypomanic episode. The Lamictal helps the mood swings. Think of your mood like a pendulum. The Lamictal keeps you from swinging too far either way. Keeps the scary lows from being so severe. This type of drug is necessary......even when you feel better. DO NOT STOP TAKING YOUR MEDICATION unless directed by your dr. 
I have tried almost every mood stabilizer they make. As well as anti-seizure medication for mood stabilization. In total, I have been on it about 15 years. They have tried others, but always go back to Lamictal. Hope this helps. Good luck to all of you:-)",1
"One of the only meds so far that has worked for me. It definitely helps and I'm impatiently waiting to get to my target dose so I can feel the full effects of being level and ""happy""",1

I go for long periods of times without cutting but I relapse from time to time. It is a powerful addiction because the release of the endorphins from the cutting is almost euphoric.

"First you need to find some way to get you those feelings workout self harming, a way to redirect your focus, something you might like to do. Read a book, colour, paint, research family tree information, hiking, journaling.... Something that can perhaps inspire you in a more positive manner. Than you need to find someone you are comfortable with communicating with... If it is a  parent, a relative, a telephone hotline.... You need to sort out some of the chaotic feelings you are dealing with. I find talk therapy with a psychologist seems a bit hard but I found one I loved and all these feelings may start pouring out and it releases some of that anxiety and tension. You need to find a good doctor you after comfortable with to help you with the possibility of meds if that's what they think you need. Having choices is really important and I hope you realize you arent alone.... Just this year I've had such horrible lows I've been so overwhelmed I've self harmed but I'm determined to be happy, I'm fighting so hard. Don't feel ashamed to say how you feel or ask for help....

"I find Bible passages help me, prayer,and knowing God's name (knowing who I am praying too) I have lived with depression most of my life , since being a small child, and now in my late 50's.

 Bible passages that can help
“Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted; he saves those who are crushed in spirit.”​—Psalm 34:18.
“Throw your burden on Jehovah, and he will sustain you. Never will he allow the righteous one to fall.”​—Psalm 55:22.
“I, Jehovah your God, am grasping your right hand, the One saying to you, ‘Do not be afraid. I will help you.’”​—Isaiah 41:13.
“Never be anxious about the next day.”​—Matthew 6:​34.
“Let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts.”​—Philippians 4:​6, 7.      ",1
If i understand correctly you are feeling suicidal because you are alone and you are struggling your disorder. It is also important to remember that our disorders do not define us. They don't define us because it is how we deal with them and how we move forward that does! A good support network is very important. Maybe going to see a psychologist or registered counsellor could help but if those just don't do it for you there are many forms of therapy including art and anything creative... look into it.. it's something that could be worth looking into.,1

I don't know.  I take Cymbalta as well and I can't get past the dizzy's.  I make my doctor put me back on it.  Unfortunately I'm at the highest dose for therapeutic use.  Little scared of what they will have to use next.  I hate withdrawl.,1
Never be ashamed to talk and be in control of it,1
"I think most people say ""I'm bipolar"" not because they are defining themselves but because it is easier than stating ""I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder"" every time they are seeking advice from people who can relate or when they reply to a comment and want the person posting to know what their diagnosis is and whether or not they can relate to their situation and or medication/treatment choices. I'm not sure what exactly the purpose behind your post is but I hope it was not meant to judge or put down anyone who may not express themselves in the same manner as yourself. I would like to think that pages such as this are meant for people suffering from mental illness to have a place to be free of negative judgment. A place where we can relate to one another, support one another, seek advice from one another and most importantly speak freely without fear of judgment. Especially, because outside of these pages, we with mental disabilities continue to be looked upon negatively. We need one another....or at least I need you all. Let's love and support one another. And yes, I'm bipolar❤",1
"Exactly, and I'm glad people are coming down on the other side of the coin on this. I don't need a guilt trip for being colloquial. If I'm telling my friends I'm having a manic episode, I say, ""I'm manic"". I'll probably type the full 'proper' language, out of fear of chiding from the Ableism Gods, but who needs that b.s.?",1
"I liked what you said. You have a good point. I say 'I'm bipolar'. When I had cancer I never said 'I'm cancer'.  But to me, saying 'I'm bipolar' is no more shameful than saying 'I'm diabetic'. It's not a label - it's an explanation.",1
"I have depression, anxiety, and ptsd. I have a sister who is schizophrenic. When it comes to word phrasing, it would be correct to either say she is schizophrenic or she has schizophrenia. Both phrases are correct. I know depression is not the same as being bi polar. That wasn't my point.",1
Only a doctor knows what they should be you and you really I used to be on Depakote and it did the exact same thing to me very irritable but it also made me very angry when I would take it so I stopped on my own taking it and it seems like yes I still have to deal with depression and anxiety and being bipolar at times but I would rather do with the sad and lonely in my heart and in my mind my soul and everything I do being judged unaccepted I'd rather just die honestly I'm so tired of this life because everytime I try to do right it seems that I never cared or it's never good enough for anyone not for my family my brothers my sisters my girlfriend her friends anybody I don't care any more myself or maybe I do care too much and I just don't know how to express it so I'm giving up,1
You don't say what your diagnosis is but you are taking meds for a range of mental health illnesses depokate is primarily for bipolar latuda is primarily to treat schizophrenia cumbalta is and anti depressant Ritalin is a stimulating mainly for Adhd impulsive behaviour and xanax anxiety panic disorder. You are not only over mediated but combination of some of these meds are potential dangerous and will coutaract each other. I  would seriously find out what your diagnosis do you have schizophrenia or experience psychotic symptions such as hearing voices hallunications delusions paranio or bipolar? If not I would determine why you on these meds.  You need to research the meds you take.,1
"I would say over medicated is an understatement but that is purely my personal opinion. I can tell you from my experience though that I too was on a huge combination of meds, started​feeling overmedicated and stopped taking them. HUGE mistake. I now only take 1500 mg of Depakote at bedtime because it does have side effects that I don't notice taking it at bed time, Klonopin for anxiety at night as well as my Zoloft at night.",1
"If you only get to see the doc for 15 minutes I'd say  that isn't acceptable. It takes some time to listen to your symptoms and see if you are doing better. I am not a doc either, but checked with a pharmacist friend. He feels it's definitely possible you are being overmedicated and your doc is just throwing more meds at you instead of better meds that work. Ask that doc exactly what each of them is for. Ritalin? It rarely works to stop racing thoughts and anxiety. Find out what each is for, tell doc that the combo isn't working for you and ask about alternatives. Do your own research too. Look up each of the meds and empower yourself with knowledge.",1
I used to worry about what they give you to take but they are highly trained people who do know what they are doing so best to stick to them to ask questions as dangerous to listen to all different people as these are strong meds you can't just stop them they need lowering by the phychartrist,1
Not sure about the meds but you only see them 15 min?  I see mine 1hr/month. BPD is complicated and I'd really doubt in 15 min they could get an accurate feel for your current situation.,1
"From this medication list, I'm going to assume that you're being treated for bipolar disorder. If that is true, then you should not be on the cymbalta, as this can make your bipolar worse. The Xanax (if taken everyday), Latuda, and Depakote can be contributing to your fatigue. The Ritalin can be contributing to the anxiety, which I'm assuming is what the Xanax is for. I'm not a psychiatrist and am not yet a health professional (currently still in pharmacy school) so I can only give you a personal opinion and not a medical opinion. But in my personal opinion, yes you are being overmedicated but I certainly have seen patients on more meds and bipolar (and mental health in general) is a complex disease state to treat. As for your Depakote, you should get used to the new medication anywhere from 1 to 2 months. If the irritability and fatigue do not go away by then or if they are affecting your daily life, you should go talk to your psychiatrist about these effects and hopefully he/she will change up your therapy. **Edit: Please please please don't stop any of your medications without discussing them with your prescriber first.**",1
Sounds like the depakote is nullifying the effects of the Ritalin. You'll be irritable if you're very tired. I don't all the other drugs your on except depakote. Talk to your doctor soon.,1
that is a lot to mix and match without knowing what ur problem is its hard to say if they are overkill i know they all do different things but i would spk to them see if there are better combination drugs or if any are really needed as sometimes u can take 1 that end up helping for a few things and u then don't need the others so much its always worth asking if u are worried they are giving u to many a specially if u get a lot of side effects if ur getting irritable and tired do bring that up as its not worth it i had that with 1 of mine now I'm on something different its so much better but don't be afraid to voice ur opinion and if u feel u need more support see about a mental health nurse as they see u reg basis i see mine every few weeks and they are so helpful,1
"some people will not acknowledge that depression, anxiety and panic attacks are an illness. Imagine they will think different when it happens to them. Let me reassure you, it is an illness. It takes seconds just too ask how someone is, try it, maybe one day you may be in that position wondering if any of your friends and famiy care about you.",1
I've been bipolar for...I can't remember. Most of my 41 years of life. It is truly part of me. It's an illness for sure. I've had it so long and will die with it. I'm not going to hide from it. I'm not ashamed of it. A spade is a spade. I AM bipolar. Regardless of how anybody else wants to put it.,1
What a love of god to show and share shame on your grudge may forgiveness and mercy be blessed to you,1
"What's a holiday, they don't get it, wasn't Easter for us yesterday, it was Sunday, which was just like Saturday and Friday and so on... These annual events (holidays for them) are just another day for us to be even more anxious about our day and give heed to us hiding in seclusion from our family. They will never understand it,   best thing to do is stop expecting them too and stop subjecting yourself to the exposure if it.",1
"If he's not currently seeking help this sounds to me like he's not open to it so you need to get as far away from him as possible. Bipolar is a life long illness & if he's not seeking help things will not get better, WILL NOT GET BETTER. Your just trying to rationalise a way to keep the relationship going & you just can't in this situation. Even medicated & counselled he will continue to have episodes, they may be less violent. It I doubt it very much in this situation because he knows he has control over you through fear.",1
Sorry to distract from original post of abuse. When referring to myself I say I AM BIPOLAR. it is a personal choice to decide. It is woven through the very core of me. I am not ashamed of it nor quiet about it. I am medicated and have worked hard to remove co-existing personality disorder. Now cured of that (YES per.dis. ARE curable with hard work) I  am high functioning most of the time. When I'm not I take time off from life so-to-speak to recover. Most people except employers know of my struggles. At least depression,1
You need to prioritize your physical safety. Give what support you can from a safe distance or with a group of friends. Mental illness is a reason for his behavior but not an excuse: don't let yourself be injured or threatened.,1
"My best friend is a lot like me,   he and I both have ptsd, bi polar along with a few other things.  We can fight, pushing the boundaries and still end laughing, maybe not the same day, but mostly. He's got a very violent temper and so do I,  although I wouldn't put my hands on anyone. He would.  We've had some really beyond boundaries fights and he wouldn't ever lay a hand on me.  Im safe with him. First guy in my life Im safe with.
Leave. Just leave. Being with someone controlling and violent regardless of bipolar is not ok.  Don't let him hurt you.
It won't get better and its your life and your peace of mind you need to protect.  I learned this way too late and wish I had left my husband in the first year of marriage. Instead, I stayed, lived in fear and much very horrific abuse for 15 years.  He finally was sentenced to 14-28 yrs in federal prison.  He's been there 10.  He gets out in 4. Im back to being afraid and so much more.  Just go. Get out. For you.",1
"I myself am bipolar, and so was my ex... we both had two opposite reactions when we were having ""off days"" he wouldn't want to be alone, where I hate being bothered. We ended up not working out because when I wanted to be alone, he'd nag me and get mad because I would go to another room. It eventually got to the point he'd corner me and I'd start panicking. If that would happen he'd start spitting in my face and slapping me.. abuse isn't a relationship. If someone loved you he wouldn't put his hands on you. I stayed with my ex way longer than I needed to... I stayed until it was life or death. If I was you I'd get out of the relationship. You can love someone, but your life is way more important than to be abused by them.",1
He obviously needs help and I hope he is willing to get it but at this point I don't think it's your responsibility and you definitely shouldn't tolerate such terrifying abuse.,1
"Hold on tight please, you are not alone. If you want to talk do not hesitate (mp).",1
"I'm in a similar boat. I'm alone I have bpd, depression and bad anxiety in everything going. Every friendship fails and relationships are messed up. Unfortunately you just got to push your way through. Hold that head up! Try to make a life you want, that's what I'm doing even though is a massive struggle. Chin up I know life is tough, you can do it, believe me I can relate to your pain..",1
Sure!! This website is for anyone. If you have questions or if you struggle with issues or know someone who is. We all have been there and we are all here for each other!!!,1
"I am so sad to see all of these comments about loved ones leaving or think it over before you commit.  
I understand that it's hard for the partner to watch their loved one go through this. I have bipolar depression 2.... 
The leaving or doubts about life with someone who suffers this, it's going to make the person fall deeper into the darkness. 
My boyfriend understands me. Yes it's hard but he supports me. And helps me up out of the dark. 
I usually have more lows than highs but he's with in both.",1
I'm pretty much alone.  I don't have any close friends anymore and my family doesn't really want anything to do with me.  I'm alone 95% of the time and I'm struggling getting used to it.  It's hard not to have anyone to turn to or talk with.,1
"I have bipolar 2 and my husband doesn't. It's hard for him. I try but it's hard for me to control it sometimes. I feel guilty for marrying him sometimes, but he tells me he can't imagine life without me. I would think it over, specially if you are not fully committed yet. It's harder on my love ones then me at times. That's why I always tell him that if it gets to be too much, let me go. Self help comes first no matter what side your on. Read about it, research, Go to a meeting called NAMI for info. Then only you can make that decision. IT IS NOT EASY, but it's worth the love. ❤️  ",1
"It's nice from you to seek advice, I believe there are  different  levels or severity of Bipolar but at the end we all deal with the same monster. Also it can be mixed with anxiety, depression, ADD, ADHD. Some can function and some cannot, it's like not knowing how you are going to feel tomorrow, or 3 hours from now",1
"When they are upset remember it's not you, it's something they have to work through in their head. Just listen and comfort them.",1
Confusing as the change between up and down can be as if a switch has been thrown. That's what it feels like to me,1
"So sorry. Don't be afraid to see a Doctor if you haven't already. Praying for you. It can be tough, tomorrow, hope for a better day. Hugs",1
"Still learning who mine are. My best friend was my wife, she chose to move on and tell me I needed to figure out my own problems. My depression and anxiety were not things she wanted to walk through with me. I don't blame her, I know dealing with me must have been hell. While unintentional, she felt unloved and uncared for.",1
"John Jackson give her time. My wife did a lil bit what she was reading was about depression tho and anxiety not bipolar. There's such a big difference in them bipolar / schizophrenia. She's the one needing education. Do you, your first. Good luck to you my Friend.",1
"Same for me. I talked about this in another post. But today my x wife is my best friend and supporter. She like a lot of people's significant others don't read up on our illness it's hard for us to explain and when we do talk about this they don't think that can happen in our heads. I was paranoid, hearing voices, seeing things, thought people were watching me or following me. It sucked that I lost the best thing to ever come into my life. She gave me a Beautiful gift tho, my son    you'd think in today's world people would be more educated and think before they judge. Sad and hurtful. I'll never stop fighting. Either should anyone. God Bless. #LiveLoveLaugh",1
I understand how you feel. My husband gets upset with me about my anxiety. He doesn't  support me and it really hurts. He doesn't  understand. It's  something I can't  control. :(,1
"Please everyone just take one day at a time don't ever live in future. I've learned just as this post says "" Who my Real Friends/Family are "" . Live everyday like it's your last. I mean that in a very respectful and good way. I'm still seeing who still there for me. They drop like flies why, because they don't understand what we're fighting in our heads . For the most part with me I can only say it's me my own demons inside. It's a fucking scary ass ride. Excuse my language. No ones ever alone. Look for support groups, seek new Dr, get a different Dr and maybe the meds you're on are not for you. Keep trying and fighting, the bell hasn't rung yet for any of us. Good luck and God bless. #LiveLoveLaugh",1
"Julie, completely understand all of this.  My parents (and us) are going through it also.  My stepdad was given 6 months-a year last October.  Your thoughts and feelings are exactly what he's been dealing with and it's so difficult to watch and try to put ourselves in his shoes.  I can't imagine how he or you feel.  He has finally come to accept this fate and has made (somewhat) of peace within.  He does still worry about when he's gone and if my mom will be ok.  I'm sure that's one of your main concerns to...how could it not?  I feel for you two and think of you often   ",1
Thanks for your bravery. I too feel like you. I'm coming up on the end of my life expectancy and am scared as well. I remember however that it's just a best guess. Live to the fullest every day works for me. I hope you find peace my friend.,1
"And the person who said RIP,  I found that rude.  Julie is still alive,  and I have hope in her that she will be alive tomorrow and so on.  Don't say RIP......      scare her why don't you.  Julie sweetheart, I send you the biggest warmest hugs. I'll be thinking of you.  And keep posting on here OK xx",1
Julie... I can't even begin to imagine what you go through on a daily basis... so I'm not gonna say that I do... but for whatever it's worth... I acknowledge your pain... and your fears for all of life' uncertainties... your reasons are valid... but please don't allow that to take time away from today... but most importantly from this moment... cherish every valuable minute that can be spent loving your loved ones...,1
"I have had anxiety my entire adult life, since my early 20's.  I am pretty much anti-meds myself, and never take medication unless I really really need to.  When my anxiety level is high, I NEED TO TAKE MY ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION.  Meditation and yoga and exercise is great.  I'm all for it.  But when I am in the throes of a panic attack they would not help me at all.  In fact, I am fairly sure that would just make me MORE ANXIOUS.  What I need to do is take a pill, and go somewhere where I can calm myself down.  Period.  End of sentence.",1
"Anxiety medication 
Xanax ???",1
I forgot to take mine today... I really wish I hadn't. I've been out all afternoon and even with my bf and my service dog. My anxiety is much higher than I've gotten used to handling.,1
"I'm trying to keep a promise made after my last failed attempt. Each day is a struggle, days filled with pain, sorrow and yes despair. Pray for all who must fight this fight. Pray for me",1
"They are doing studies now and saying taking a probiotic daily is good for depression anxiety and order mood disorders - a healthy gut keeps the immune system happy and also helps with the seratonin levels - kids with autism as well 
It's worth trying I think",1
"Weed only with bi-polar?  Thats insane advice... you trying to make her manic? If its just anxiety, I agree 100%. If its depression, weed only masks the problem, it does NOT treat it... after the high your back at square one.",1
"I did. But just like any other antidepressant, I didn't respond well to it and made me more depressed. I've never had a good response to antidepressants and a psychiatrist from the hospital said she would never give them to me because my symptoms would not be a good fit for them. Anxiety and mania medications work wonders for me and balance out my depression. Antipsychotics have the same reactions as antidepressants, they all sedate me 24/7 so that I can't function.",1
"Definitely communicate. Don't wait until way down the road to bring something up that bothers you. During your engagement is a good time to practice and explore how to communicate during a stressful event, utilize that!! It will help your marriage go smoother because it will help make communicating a habit.",1
As some have suggested it's best to communicate with him and he may be upset when he reads this as your posts may come up in his feed. It's sad when you feel unloved but many people face depression without a partner so you should discuss your feelings with him. If you are engaged you must have trust and feel able to discuss your feelings. As for money it's immaterial and should not equate to how much someone loves you. It's sometimes more rewarding just stopping in and listening to music and smiling as for every moment of sadness there will be a new day on the horizon. If you can talk to one another you can celebrate everyday and be content knowing that you are not alone. Concentrate on the good things you share x,1
"I would start with your dr. Maybe you need a increase in dose,or different medicine. With your new life changes comes stress. Stop,breathe,use what you have learned. Keep your head up!",1
"You're under a lot of stress and that will really compound your depression and moods. The most ""normal"" people are greatly affected by these types of situations. It would be so good if you could see a psychiatrist because they are much more knowledgeable about these medications. You may be able to see a psychiatric nurse practitioner and it would be less expensive. Just keep breathing, sweet pea. You will make it!",1
I would imagine the fact you are looking for teaching  posts is causing some stress and anxiety you - most people would feel under pressure in this situation so its not abnormal to feel like that. You should write down exactly how you are feeling to try and identify the trigger which may enable you to move forwards and try and address it.  Your GP could increase your dosage as 20 mg is lowest dose of Prozac or there are many it her anti depressants which are also good got anxiety such as sertraline (Zoloft).,1
"I can't and won't comment on your medications since I am not a Doctor. Relocating, searching for work and just being a teacher are stressful enough, use the CBT as it best applies to you. Discuss medications with professionals and your feeling and plans with all friends available, attempt to do what you feel is best for you, trust your judgment. Good luck.",1
That is a lot of pressure to be under. Looking for a new job is extremely stressful. What you are going through is normally very challenging to someone not on meds. You should talk to your Dr about adjusting your meds and get to a therapist so you can talk through what is going on in your life.,1
"I agree that exercise, meditation, yoga, and positive thinking are good for mental health. However, there is more to mental health than exercise and positive thinking. Depression is real and can kill if not properly treated. Everyone responds differently. GP generally are not knowledgeable about mental illness. I was getting refills from mine and my meds actually should have been changed but she didn't have the expertise to treat me. I had a spiral down hill with many trips to the hospital because I was so suicidal and mania so high mixed with anxiety. It actually got much worse. Go see a psychiatrist. Counseling is helpful. Sometimes I get frustrated because I feel like the techniques are blaming me for being sick. I think it's learning to use them appropriately, which is not always taught correctly.",1
"I would talk to the GP and consider more therapy. Sometimes, we just need a refresher on the techniques for helping ourselves. I have no doubt that the job stressors are what's causing this relapse, so just go talk through it with someone.",1
"I thought this was supposed to be a place to come for support. Telling a person who is already struggling in a deep amount of pain that ""no one cares"" is even more hurtful and triggering. Sounds like some people are stuck in their own dysfunction, projecting it onto others, and don't know the skill of when to be quiet.",1
"I've been with my husband for 3 years & let me tell you, we've been thru a lot of struggles dealing with finances. We have both come to realize that monetary things are not as important as just being together. The most important things come from the heart, not the wallet..",1
"Tell him how you feel but honestly if you expect to be given something or have something special done for you every 5 months you will be truly disappointed! Think about the good things, does he treat you right every other day? Does he show his love every other day? My husband and I have been together for 17 years it's only in the past 2-3 yrs that he's actually mad an effort to celebrate our anniversaries! He tells me he loves me ever day and kisses me every day so I'm nit worried about what he doesn't do on the anniversaries!

"Nobody gives a fuck. A fucking mental health hotline ""counselor"" told me to go to a fucking urgent care place in a strip mall.

 The most important thing is to find the resources available to you on campus. I went to Umass Amherst and they had psychologists and psychiatrists right on campus that took my insurance. A good place to start would probably be with your RA. There are places to go right on campus. Biggest thing: find a professional who you can talk to. And if you feel that they aren't a good fit, try someone else. Not all doctors are for everyone, and trust is so important. Don't be afraid to find one that fits. 

I struggled so much before I got the help I needed. You need to be patient with yourself and take care of *you* first. Looking back, I wish I had taken a semester or 2 off to get myself settled. I felt too much pressure not to, though, which wasn't the best for ME. I missed so many classes it was ridiculous. I withdrew from classes and bombed entire semesters. The simple act of moving to college triggered my depression. I've struggled since.  There are a lot of resources. Please, please take advantage of them. Also keep in mind that afsp.org and nami.org are excellent places to talk to people. There's even a chat on afsp.org, if memory serves! You can PM me on here if youd like to.

"Hello,
Thank you for sharing here, I'm glad you decided to post and open up. You have a lot going on right now and feeling overwhelmed is completely normal. You still have a month left and in that time you can only.do what you can do. Take care of yourself first, that is the most important. After semester you will have the summer to regenerate. 
Sometimes when I have anxiety I find a quiet space that  gives me comfort. 
If you had to redo this semester it wouldn't be ideal but if you were feeling better it would be worth it. 
Please know that you are not alone, there are a lot of other students that feel the same way. Please reach out to someone close and talk about how you feel. There are.resources on campus also you can text 741-741 for text support. 

You can private message me, I would be happy to talk more. 
You are not alone, keep fighting.",1
"Hello my dear friend,

Realistically, you can’t expect to make it through school without having to deal with some kind of stress. Granted, too much stress can be oppressive. Wise King Solomon wrote: “Mere oppression may make a wise one act crazy.” (Ecclesiastes 7:7) 

But you need not let stress drive you crazy. The key is learning how to manage stress effectively. And if you're suffering from depression, there's help out there. 

Please don't give up. You have a good whole life ahead of you. ❤️

Hope you'll find beneficial, as it did others, this timely article I'm sharing with you. ❤️

"you're feeling overwhelmed and frustrated and that's entirely understandable and you're not alone. talking about this helps tremendously and well done for taking the step of reaching out. some ideas that may help you are: meditation, light exercise - just going for a walk around the block will help to give you some ""space"" in your head so you can focus and concentrate more. keep your water intake at optimum levels and don't skip breakfast. above all be kind to yourself, this is a challenging time for you. you have everything you need to get through this, even if it may feel that you don't. I wish you all the best, keep talking about it, and allow yourself to experience the underlying emotions. The awful
symptoms you have will subside, i promise. it may help to make a list of the studying you need to do, and then prioritise it based on what you know well and what you don't. take baby steps and before you know it you'll be finished studying. Don't beat yourself up, it is obviously important to you to finish this year and pass, and i'm sure you will with flying colours.",1
"Go see a counselor on campus or make an appointment with a psych doctor in your area. It's normal to struggle when you make a big change in your life (like starting college), but if it starts to interfere with your ability to live life--as this clearly is--you shouldn't be ashamed to get help. Please. Reach out and get professional help. I was scared when I first did, but they are honestly there to help you.",1
Sometimes it's one breath at a time in order to walk through stressful times. You're stronger than you think!,1
"YOU ARE NOT ALONE.  I have exactly the feelings you describe every day. My family thinks I can just let it go and get over it too.  Let us on this site help you navigate the storm. I have received a lot of support and understanding on here. The belief that feelings like yours and mental illnesses​ are results of chemical imbalances in the brain has been understood for a while. The challenge is to get the right meds to restore the proper balance of seratonin (the main happy feeling substance for the brain) .  I also take Effexor and works for me but everyone is different. Try to have patience because finding the right meds for you can take a while. Some meds can take 4 weeks to get to theraputic levels and help.  My racing thoughts are from anxiety and it sounds like yours are too. Take some time to research symptoms of anxiety and I think you will find they describe those racing thoughts and worries you describe. The most helpful medication I take is busparone. It has done wonders for relieving my racing thoughts and worries about everything. That's what is specifically for. I take 30 mg in the morning and at night but started at 15mg. Anxiety has lots of faces. Look it up in several places. I had no idea what I was experiencing was anxiety. Let your doc know your symptoms. Tell him "" I think I am having a lot of anxiety because..."". There are several benzodiazapines ( like Klonopin) that some prescribe but beware of them because they are addictive and coming off them is no fun. Busparone has been my savior. You need to have a doc that listens. Look up depression and anxiety and see how they relate to each other. Best advice I can give. Know yourself! Take control of your own recovery!!    ",1
Shame on people for telling your crazy...it's an illness so don't believe them when they say that to you. My Dr also put me on citalopram 20mg..that wasn't strong enough so he increased to 40mg..it helps but makes me incredibly tired after about 3 hrs and I have to take a nap...hope you feel better soon...remember there are millions of people just like us..your not alone..#bipolarlove..,1
"U r not crazy or alone! Seeking help is the right choice! Sounds like r going through the same thing I am diagnosed Bipolar and trying to get through a major depressive stage but it's been super scary I've cut to release the internal pain or hope it will I've gone to the ER I constantly trying to get my brain to be a peace and the obsessive thoughts to go away and almost relapsed a
Few times to make it go away! I keep trying to get better but it like a storm warning to my family and the doctors and they keep ignoring it but Try to stay strong and keep fighting to find out what is going on and get the proper meds to at least ease some of it and go to therapy or join a support group or messages me! Talking to people going through the same thing or have gone through it also helps! U are in my thoughts  ",1
"I love the compassion I've read here. In a world full of negative and unsettling, this is great to read.",1
Hugs and prayers. Don't hesitate to get professional help. You are worth it.,1
"1. Big hugs.
2. You are not alone.
3. Take the medication as it should help. It will take time for the medication to work. If it doesn't, dont give up hope. Ask to see a psychiatrist, they are better at diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues. It is a chemical imbalance in the brain and its nothing to be ashamed of. I am bipolar and the medications I take let me be me again. I laugh and have fun and im social again. But I lost 10 years-10 very important years being stubborn and figuring I could out will the feelings of sadness. Be brave. Try the meds.

- I know you are scared, but it does get better. The fact you have reached out and asked for help makes you very brave. If you get the urge to attempt suicide, please go to the closest emergency room as they will be able to help you. Or call a help line.",1

"I too am struggling and I know it's scary... no one understands and you feel yourself slipping. Medication is scary... scary to need it, scary side effects, scary that you might not be able to function without it once established... but I can tell you this, I struggle with my damn meds every day but without them I wouldn't be here. As for counseling or therapy, it does not make you crazy, or weak or any thing other than aware you need someone to talk to!

Oh please... like one can meditate quietly when your mind is racing one minute and shut off the next. This person is is in turmoil right now and it seems like he/she is alone in the chaos of their mind. Meditation? Sorry but this isn't a solution for a person in this current state. Just saying.,1

"I'm on efexor xr 375mg. I take 150mg in the morning 75mg at lunch and 150mg at night. Plus I'm on clonazapam and epilum. But we will leave them out for now. 
Efexor, i have split doses because i get the brain zaps. It feels like your brain is being zapped and it kinda travels down your body and feels like your eyes are shaking. 
The split had kinda helped but not really. I sweat so bad sometimes that people ask me if I'm ok at work and wake up in a pool of sweat.
I've been on it for about 7 years and scared to come off as I've heard it's horrible. 
I also get severe gastrointestinal issues I've only really had them since efexor. The nausea might be to do with that. I have IBS, had gallstones and GORD (reflux). Something to be mindful of. 
I hope it works for you as it does work for a lot of people.",1
"The effexer hasn't been working for me so the doc is weaning me off of it and I've got terrible brain zap. Its almost debilitating and makes me super irritable and I'll snap at people I work with and just start crying for no reason and get suicidal thoughts that won't go away. 

I hope this medication works for you. Its extremely difficult coming off of it for me.",1
"Effexor was the worst for me. I've been taking different ones for almost 10 years and i gained so much weight, side effects were horrible, my vision got bad, my memory. I'm on celexa now.",1
"I was very nauseous for two weeks the until it settled. I stayed on the venlefaxine for a year and a half and it eventually stopped working so my doc upped my dosage and it was a horrible experience once he did it manifested my depression more and more so I was weined off of it and switched to ciprilex 10 mg and it has made a huge difference, I love the way it has helped me Cope and stopped my bad thoughts. I highly recommend ciprilex it has little to no side effects and didn't make me nauseous at all. Good luck",1
omg..I cannot take effexor..it made me paranoid as crap...I didn't even want my bf to go to work every morning..I begged him to stay home..I will never take that again,1
I changed from mirtazapine to Sertraline to now effecor and find it the most effect for me. If i ever miss a dose i do go very dizzy and confused but it goes away when i take it again.,1
It was the first medication I was prescribed. After two weeks I was shaking uncontrollably so stopped taking it. But everyone is different so give it a try.,1
"Have you tried LSD?
I'm not joking. I've struggled with being bipolar and depression my entire life. So has my mum. I've watch her down so many various kinds of pills and the only things that's happened is she lost all her teeth (side effect)
I found reasons I might not be awful. I still feel like that sometimes but the feeling I had then are still there. It's like ""hey maybe you don't suck""
I was always scared of LSD but it's honestly just a great introspective experience. It's like smoking weed but a bit more visual. 
I see now why they're trying to get it approved for ptsd therapy.",1
I was on effexor for 14 yrs  but after having problems & having heart attack  they took me off them changed to zoloft because    effexor makes anxiety worse can give u high adrenaline outrages  it makes ur heart rate go very fast  also i had so much trouble comming off them bad experience  but eveeyone is affected differently,1
Is Effexor XR. You want the extended release. But if you start taking it need you need to take it consistently because if you miss a dose I know I have horrible nightmares and became spaced out. I know when I doctor added Adderall to my med line up in 2010 it was a life changer for me. It boots the antidepressants. I don't feel antidepressants or mood stabilizers alone do crap. They just keep us down. Need something to boost us up. Keeps me awake functioning and productive. Totally different person. Got this information from Carrier Clinic. Saved my life.,1
"Yes welcome to our club of family denial. Wasn't until my 2nd hospitalization and the change my husband and children saw in me. I became a functioning wife and mother again and are thrilled to see me out if my bed in a daily basis. Still have my panic attacks occasionally,band can get manic at times, but the clonzepam can even that out. Don't ever let anyone tell you it's not real or it's a cop out, shake it off, or go for a walk. It's a chemical imbalance. Nothing to be ashamed of. Took years of ER visits until finally someone got me the help I needed. I got so tired of trying to explain bipolar, manic depression, panic anxiety disorder to everyone, I printed out material on it and gave it to them to read. Those who cared did, those who didn't are not in my life anymore. We have a hard enough time trying to deal with our illness and managing ourselves let alone having to try and babysit the ""well"" people through it. Tell them to get a support group and educate themselves. My kids could tell you anything about my mental illness today and are not ashamed.",1
"Thank you for this validation! Just today I was having to state my case to a family member who believes bipolar or depression is just a cop out to function normally, believes meds only make it worse... I tried explaining why this med helps in combo w my other meds all Dr prescribed, but it was just a losing battle. It's awful when your own mother doesn't validate mental Illness as a legitimate illness like any other... but I digress. I'm grown, don't require her approval or support even, but all the judgment and blaming me for everything that is negative in everyones life and accusing me of using bipolar and anxiety as an excuse, I could certainly do without. This is a big enough battle to fight daily, don't need more on top to fight... I'm learning to let it go, doesn't really matter in the end how she treats me anyway, yeah?",1
I was taking 225mg daily but I hated the side effects especially the excessive sweating! I weaned myself off it eventually but even that was horrible. It's a very toxic drug in my opinion,1
My sweating has stopped now I'm off Venlaflaxine Rianne Shaw. It's a  horrible drug!,1
I literally couldn't cope with it. It was so embarrassing!,1
The sweating is horrible! I am weaning off of 150mg right now and it's horrible.,1
"OCD behaviors cause addictive tendencies in people more easily. What I have found is to change my obsessive thought patterns (and addiction causing thoughts because of this) into something more productive. Addictions don't have to technically be a bad thing. ""

It's not always a substance, for me it can be as simple and researching something for animal treats (research has become a huge ""positive"" addiction for me) or becoming addicted to creating projects to focus on when I am doing badly.

Im so frustrated.",1
One more thing I like to add. You just don't all of a sudden say I think I have bipolar or say I'm bipolar you're born with it. It's inherited thru one side of family or the other yes some get depressed sometimes your head does go nutty but this is the thing most of us I can guarantee have people in our families that have this disease also. Bipolar isn't like cancer where it just pops up it may seem like that to us who have this but it's definitely inherited. That's the the sucky part. I wouldn't wish this disease on my worst enemy. Thanks friends for the support. It took me until last year to actually not care about what others think. I was embarrassed scared to death to say anything because people have said to me stop being Bipolar. That's what stopped me from saying anything. Now Idc yes I am bipolar not happy about it but today I can talk about this and not feel embarrassed or ashamed. Good luck to all and anyone wanting to repost anything I say go for it. If I can help just one person come out of their shell I've helped a million to me. #LiveLoveLaugh   ,1

I've only been taking wellbutrin for about 6 months but I'm like a new person. However it does not help with anxiety which I'm still struggling with but it has helped with my depression tremendously. I actually lost some weight when I started it and I'm not as hungry all the time. So it's helped in a lot of ways. It's something I would most definitely recommend to anyone.,1
Wellbutrin didn't help me at all and in fact Im positive it increased my anxiety. I talked to my pharmacist and they said that it's known to cause anxiety and not always the best option for someone with it.,1

Does that mean I don't have faith? No. My faith is what sent me to the hospital because at least I was in a safe place with Jesus and couldn't hurt myself. And going through that, lost everything else - housing, family, friends, job; faith in Jesus was all I had. Now I'm going to stop having a pity party for myself and get out of this depression.

Yes it really depends... Its either crippling anxiety or muscle tension... Or in my case restless legs...prozac helps but at the end of the day you are what you think... If all your gonna think about is anxiety your gonna feel anxious it's all in your mind... After a while you're mind and body forgets how to be normal and happy...so all you know is feeling like shit..patience is everything if you have a mental illness.. Take it one day at a time...,1
Yes. Sick feeling inside. I sleep uncontrollably alot. I could still be unable to stay awake even if I slept all day.chest tightening. Hard to breath. That's anxiety attacks though. Just exhaust,1

Especially given the fact they know my mental health is in flux and they are MHPs!?!...Pretty sure some other former colleagues would not have acted in the same way, if they knew...I did not expect to be treated in such a way...I am aware that when I was high I was spewing out stuff all over the place...But surely if they understand anything about Bipolar Disorder, they would not find that a good enough reason to treat me like the shit they must scrape of their shoe... ~ major disappointment! I feel guilty/ashamed/ embarrassed for trying to communicate at all. I wish I had just remained silent, which is my usual coping mechanism when I go to ground but being high totally overrides your self control and inhibition, which has obviously upset/annoyed/pissed off, and disgusted some folks...Feeling so despondent and isolated at this point.

"I'm sorry but the person saying ""being in a relationship with a bipolar person is the last thing you need"" is terrible advice. As someone who is bipolar 1 and ultra rapid cycling I can tell you I am a whole new brand of crazy. My HUSBAND that has spent 10 years with me and going through this battle with me would say the same. My husband is not bipolar, but has sever depression and anxiety himself. We support each other. On my good days he leans on me, on my bad days I lean on him. We learned about each others issues and how to help each other. We did couples therapy to heal some of the wounds I caused before I was diagnosed and properly medicated. Never give up on someone just because they have a mental illness. Living with Bipolar disorder, or any other anxiety depression disorder us HARD. Especially with Bipolar because of the stigma, you feel ashamed and unaccepted and scared for people to know. Because you never know how they will react.  From my own personal experience I was not completely open with my husband or anyone close to me until I was finally properly medicated and thinking clearly. I have relationships that got stronger and I have relationships with friends that ended because they never wanted to learn what it really is like not just the movies. And if you are a bipolar person out there who feels like you can't be in a relationship because of your mental illness, you are wrong. It is possible. I'm not going lie and say it is easy. Shit at one point I was throwing things across the room at my husband's head for no reason. But he understood I needed more help then I had, I got the right help. Now I am happy, healthy, stable and working closely with my psychiatrist to plan starting a family. Living life to fullest with mental illness is possible.",1

But at the end of the day, we still say ""I love you"" and kiss goodnight. We know we want to be together so we're willing to fight for it.",1

So my mind goes back and forth. What is the best thing to do for me. I share because if it can help others maybe. I walk and used to work I have so much pain!I have to keep it together. I have my dog and place. And my son also just don't see him anymore really. And two others in another state.then my sister also so when does it end?I tried all meds also nothing.,1

I was exercising but got too depressed to do that.  I'm going to address all this today with my psychiatrist except the alcohol part.  He'll take away my valium if he knows I'm drinking.  The seroquel turns me into a zombie.  It's supposed to be for sleep.  I sleep for 2 hours then wake up and eat like a pig and just lie there until I fall back asleep.

Maybe you could take your little one to see a doctor about her issue with toileting? This could really help your's & her's situation & relieve some of the stress on yourself. I'd also recommend seeking government assistance/support to help with your financial situation until your back on your feet & I'd defer University for a semester. It's not easy to go through what your going through, although there are steps you can take to ease or even rectify your greatest stresses.
Lastly, if your psych isn't meeting your needs, try explaining this to him/her otherwise search for one you feel would be more suitable for you.",1

"First, you've got to tell this to family. Your child needs to be safe so you can get a break and sort yourself out. Parents? Siblings? Father's parents? Who can take the pressure off you for a week or so?
If you're failing classes, you need to look at your options. Talk to your teachers and tell them you have a medical situation causing this temporary slump in grades but what are your options? You may need time off due to the break up because you won't be able to concentrate or sleep well, and free counseling is something you probably need to heal. Try and stay on the meds and let them settle. New meds take about six weeks to fully work. Good luck! Don't forget to find a bipolar support group in your area.",1

I have some some savings that I'm living on but it won't last forever.  I'm going through a bankruptcy and divorce at the same time, too.  I'm just stuck.  I sleep and watch TV mostly, try to exercise but have been failing miserably at that lately.   I drink, too, which isn't good.  Just know that other people are struggling too.  I keep telling myself that things are going to work out but nothing changes.",1
STOP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT YOU DONT HAVE AN BE THANKFUL FOR WHAT YOU DO HAVE AN WHEN YOU HAD THAT CHILD IT BECAME ABOUT HIM NOT YOU GET IN A GOOD CHURCH GO TO CLASS ONLINE THEY HAVE GRANTS,1
"First & foremost don't take the stress of work home with you. Use the time you're not working doing something you enjoy and relaxing a bit. If there is any way to go to local groups that might be helpful too or even religious services if you are a religious person. Also, although I know it can be hard to get up early if you have a lot of fatigue but it really helps to have extra time to get your day started and make your morning routine something that pumps you up and motivates you for the day. These are things that help me at least and I hope it can help you too :)",1
"Well first you should congralate yourself that you can hold dowm a job and a highly paid one. Apart from allowing time for appointments, giving you chance to reduce your hours or change duties even for temporary period refer you to occupational health for support, ensure you dobt experience  discrimination bullying etc at work not sure what else you think they should do. I dont know where you are from or what sector you work in. Sometimes you need to step back and if that means changing jobs or taking less stressful lower paid job for your health then you zhpujd consider it. I have had to except that although I have a reasonable job with a reasonable salary I'm never going to be able to do a more senior job due to my MH and I have really struggled to accept that and not feel and if I am a failure but I know for me that's how it is.",1
My experience too. Work wasn't understanding and on top of it I had coworkers threaten me as well as supervisor. Ended up walking out and getting baker acted. Now trying for disability. Difficult surviving let alone dealing with the disorder. Prayers for all.,1
Is a stress leave an option? Maybe you just need a little break to recharge your battery?,1
"All I can offer is my thirst knowing what Bipolar Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder are about. I have the depression and hypo mania of Bipolar Disorder II plus which I have chronically lived with. 

The illnesses are simultaneously genetic disorders and environmentally influenced  diseases, hence psychiatric conditions being referred as either disorders or illnesses to the exclusion of the nature nurture controversy. 

As stress and   trauma impact on one with the genetic disorder of BP  (environmeninfluence)",1
I suggest looking up mindfulness. It's a technique therapists use for anxiety and I'm sure it would be helpful in your situation. When I start to feel uneasy about s situation I pull out some play doh and get my mindfulness head on. I focus on the play doh and smell it feel it squish it rub it against my cheek etc. it's about focusing on something else. I've even done it with a tissue. A really simple version but a bit more invasive is colouring. Again a way to really empty the mind and focus on 1 specific thing. There are lots of resources on the net and even apps for your phone. All the best.,1
I found it helped me greatly when i had post natal depression it calmed me down more than anything nd anxiety was all pretty much gone...i was on 50mg ns eventually it pooped out cause i didnt want to up it nd got pretty depressed it didnt boost me up anymore bur that was after 2 yrs,1
"I haven't had a manic episode in a while but have been very depressed.  I've been isolating, sleeping, eating poorly and drinking a lot of beer.  I'm lonely but don't want to be around anyone.  One of my meds is seroquel which I hate.  I take it for sleep and it's unpredictable.  Most nights I'll sleep for two hours, wake up, eat all kinds of junk and then go lie down for hours waiting for sleep to come.  It's horrible.   But it beats a manic episode.  I'm in the doctors office right now waiting to see him.",1
Do you keep a mood journal? It can be a great way of keeping track and you may be able to avoid those bad situations you mentioned. I know a great thing to stop me from spending all my money into put my credit card into a bucket of water into the freezer. You have to wait for the ice to melt before you can use it and by that time the urge may have stopped. I hope you can weather this episode. Try and sleep if you can. Take care.,1
Self-awareness is extremely important when fighting mental illness. You can get through this cycle and you know it. Ride it out and think twice at every turn. Avoid regret. You can do it!,1
No one will ever understand what we go through every day. Then we have mania when we feel we can accomplish anything. Then bang the depression sets in. It's soul destroying. All I ask for is to be normal. Even with medication I still struggle.,1
I have high anxiety driving just local I get all worked up to just drive to work which is maybe a mile or a little over.  I hate to drive. I even get worked up being a passenger at times if I have to go out of town. It is more common then people want to admit. I hate driving and it is so hard for people understand how my anxiety gets. There are some crazy drivers out there which does not help.,1
60mg all the way down to none I had constant anxiety,1
"My doctors told me that ssri's are bad for my hypomania.  I'm on Latuda(helps), Valium and Neurontin for panic/anxiety (helps) and Seroquel (hate it) for sleep.  The Seroquel puts me to sleep for maybe 2 hours and then I wake up and eat everything in sight.",1
It's horrible.  I want to try and get ambien when I see him on Thursday.,1
"At 30mg, I had a lot of irritability and agitation. My daughter didn't even want to talk to me. My doctor put me on 60 mg and most of it went away.",1
"Agitation, Anxiety, Mania. That drug did threw me from depression straight into high level hypomania and mixed states. I'm fairly certain that was the drug that landed me in the hospital.",1
That sucks cause same thing happened to me was on the 30mg for less than 2 weeks ans i couldnt even tolerate it..rage agitation and worse anxiety:( wasnt sure whether the dose was too small or just it plain didnt agree for me..in the past pristiq and effexor worked ok so thought this one would too,1
I've been on 30mg and now on 60mg occasionally get anxiety but nothing severe unless I haven't taken my meds. Cymbalta is to treat both depression and anxiety from what my GP advised when I was first put on it though,1
"I think much of of this fear and loathing is based on the horrible stigma of mental illness. I hate being bipolar also but we have a sickness that people, professionals included, and science, know so little about so we are poisoned with medication to survive in an unwelcoming world, like lepers.",1
We all have our struggles and stories some like to share and some find it to hard to try and begin to but we must be strong and keep the faith and hope for guidance to get through we can and will be determined to continue people ..* love and Blessings to all.*,1
"Not sure what we're all suffering here but I've heard it said those with anxiety are pretty empathic so can help others, but o always find helping myself is a whole different ball game",1
"Do it no matter how scary it seems, you'll be glad you did",1
"Talking to someone is the biggest best first step - think of it as start a journey towards a happier life. See it as a bright light. Think of it as the best wish you could ever wish for. Get someone to take you/escort you of getting out of the house or the journey is the thing you fear. Please go / find the help and support to go. Talk to someone on the phone while you get ready and go,  to encourage and support you over the phone if no one can help you go in person.",1
"I recently decided to go back to therapy. The first one did not ""fit"". But I love the second one! So remember, YOU choose who YOU see and not the other way around. If it does not feel right, keep looking for the right one. I spent way too much money on the wrong ones in the past who did not listen to me or what I wanted or needed. But they really can help with your anxiety! Good luck!!",1
I go to a therapist once a month and I STILL have a panic attack the day before and right up until I am sitting in his office.,1
"I have anxiety issues as well. I used to have panic attacks thinking about going and not sleep the night before. Now I look forward to my friday morning sessions. My sister in law tried counseling and didn't feel comfortable with her counselor,  find someone different don't just stop going. Sometimes it's trial and error to find the right fit",1
"I had panic attacks on my first few sessions but now I'm starting to feel comfortable. So it's okay. Remember that they're professionals in that field and probably have seen a lot of people having panic attack so they won't see you as someone weird or crazy.
Saying this because I think panic attack gets worse when you control it because you don't want other people to see it. So tell yourself it's okay to have panic attack. Afterall, that's the reason why you need professional help.",1
"go do something to occupy your mind and stop thinking  about it so much? It's only a thought, Let It go!! you look back in a week and I think how silly for you to think that this could cause you anxiety or stress. It will pass!",1
I had the exact same anxiety and I was so happy once I made the decision to go see someone. You'll be happy you did. Also get a journal or at least a piece of paper and try to write Down whatever you're feeling/going through and what aspects of your life are factors in your mental health. Trying to remember everything when you know you only have 30 minutes or an hour or whatever sometimes makes me feel pressured,1
"I worry myself almost to death when it's time for my 3 mo. Appointment then I feel so relieved when it is over....I have no idea why this happens....but, every 3 mo. I put myself through a world of worry.  Hang in there, I know how you feel...you will be so relieved when its over.",1
"Just remember they are here to help and they are not judging  you it isn't a test . They usually help you to learn how to manage it and it can be very useful opening up to a stranger I had CBT and for me it did wonders !! :) hope all goes well x

I suggest taking some 'Rescue Remedy' (can be found in most pharmacies) it really helps me settle my anxiety. Hope this helps x",1
"panic attacks suck...I am so much better now...I was really bad at one point...several trips to ER..couldn't drive, couldn't go eat out...did counseling and it help...it taught me how to control them...took clonzapam since 2001...now I am off and on xanax as needed....still have my klons though...do the counseling...good luck..so glad I am getting over that crap...but the fear is still there...",1
I've just had to have my esa assessment hated every minute of being in there I've also got to go to counciling aswell as a psychological assessment so in the same boat and seriously worried about it all have I done enough in the assessment etc I hope that I goes ok for both of us,1
"Don't worry, I also have anxiety and panic attacks. My counsellor was amazing, they let you go at your pace, he/she will be there every step of the way for you. Tell them how you're feeling at that precise moment. They won't make you do anything you're uncomfortable with or stressed out with. After all they're there to help and guide you. Take care and good luck x",1
I found counselling a god send and a relief. Just keep telling yourself this is a good thing. If you do have a panic attack they will be able to talk you through it which will be helpful for the next panic attack.,1
Always knew that anxiety and depression frequently hang out together.,1
I started   low  on quitipine     now  I am on 600    at night     this last mounth I have become so I'll nearly  was addmited   to Helston hospital       to day   I have a med review   as  I still needing help    I got to say   my doctor  and  my care worker    helping me best as they  can    never lie to them be as onisted  as you can       and to all you other   being horrible   to this person   who needs help not you stupid   fucking judgment,1
"I understand exactly how you feel. I would sit and listen to my Dr. drone on and on about medicine I was taking and the dosage. I have been thru a gambit of drugs with no success. Finally I got angry and told the Dr. I was not a test dummy to give me something that worked. I just wanted to feel better. I believe I scared the Dr. because I yelled so loud. I told him I needed him to listen to me because it was my turn to talk. My appointment ran over but he got my message. I'm not cured but I'm doing one Hell of a lot better. 
I moved into an apartment 2 years ago and still have unpacked boxes in the kitchen. I used to be a bundle of energy now nothing seems to rattle me because I know Ill get to it eventually.",1
Sharon who is suffering from his  I was diagnosed With anxiety. That was part off why I needed to talk to someone I love. Now since I am finally Cancer free I don't get quite so anxious any more. It feels terrible to suffer from that   ,1
And you shouldn't be shamed for it!,1
My driving phobia started in July 2006 on a trip between Jackson MS and Memphis.  ideas: either claustrophobia OR Agoraphobia OR both.  Dr had me try rolling my windows down while driving. The further away the destination or the longer the trip or the more stops I have to make intensifies the anxiety.   Over the past three years it has gotten to where I can't leave the house without having some sort of anxiety or a full-blown panic attack.  I have reached my destination before and had to leave because everything started going black and I started hyperventilating and felt like I would pass out.,1
I can't go too far from home or I get panic/anxiety bad.   I have to take Valium & Neurontin to go anywhere in a car.,1
"I suffer from the same. I try to talk myself out of it, but it is very difficult. I hope you find a way to tackle this. I know how terrifying it is.",1
"Agoraphobia, boerline personality disorder, Bi-polar, PTS Disorder and degenerative disc disorder are what my everyday is filled with. Disability at the age of 32, child support and total of $88 for food. No phone to make or receive calls, no car to make it to Dr. Appointments for Phycologist, gastrologist, Neurologist, counseling and family PA. 
The only thing that gets me through every moment of the day is the positivity I try to surround myself with. It is very easy for negative self pity to sneak into our minds, as soon as you realize you're thinking or being negative smack it down with something anything positive. Make small goals, can't take a shower cause it's too scary wash your face or even just wash your hands. Chin up buttercup!",1
"I'm sorry I don't have a solution for you but you arent sponging and you should've feel ashamed to ask for assistance or help, you need it in order to get better. I'm in the same situation and it's so hard some days. I wish there was more help for those with mental illness, worrying about having a roof over your head or stress doesn't help when you are ill, don't lose hope when things get bad. I hope things get better.",1
"You might want to ask your doctor about being bipolar. You sound manic with anxiety to me. I'm not a doctor but I have bipolar. Do you have reckless behavior, the shopping thing we know, do you have mood swings. Being low and depressed not wanting to get out of bed. Do you go into an extreme high on life like you can do anything?  These are all traits of bipolar. I have bipolar 2 with depression, anxiety, PTSD from abuse as a child. Please make an urgent appt. with your doctor. Also keep a thought journal. Account for your spending, any racing thoughts, sleepless nights, and eating. Take to your dr. There is a questionnaire on bipolar disorder they can give you.",1
Unfortunately I find myself feeling the same way. Being able to not only find something I like and being able to actually buy it! I have something I have never admitted to but I found myself shoplifting. I have since Dec stopped that ilegal habbit! Still struggle everyday with doing absolutely everything I can to give myself at Least one positive thing or thought a day! Good luck to you!,1
It sounds like your agitating and highly anxious which is understandable. Hang in there. The clothes won't hide how you feel.,1
"This is what I started to do before my  Manic Depressive episode. I am not trying to diagnose you, but if you have a regular psychiatrist, please talk to them. I had Chronic Depression for five years and as the stress built up while preparing to teach a class of my peers, I finally had to be ""committed"" for two weeks for my own safety. Your upcoming trial is definitely more of an ordeal then mine. I wish you well, and pray you receive the help and justice required.",1
"I do the same with art supplies.  I have so many sketch books, pencils, markers....you name it I have it.  It makes me feel so good to get these thing but then I crash later when I have trouble using them or can't find inspiration right away.  You're not alone.  I almost had a panic attack at the grocery store, tonight, just because I know my money was really limited but I needed food.  I was lucky my mom was with me because when I got in the car she distracted me with chit chat and I calmed down.  Anxiety is a booger but you are hear and you are alive and you're sharing with us.  Good luck with the trial.  Will be thinking about you.",1
"Its Mania. Get some rest,  get a hobby and avoid stress. No drinking.",1
Try mindfulness. There are plenty of resources on the net and I think there are even apps you can download. That can help to focus your thoughts and attention onto things that are more helpful. I'd also speak to your dr. Keep a mood journal that you can take to your appointment as it can help with diagnosis and is there so you don't have to stress about remembering everything.,1
"It's really normal to avoid thinking about big, difficult, upcoming things with compulsive behaviours like spending.",1
"I used to do this... You are trying to find things that make you happy or keep your focus away from at the stress and overwhelming emotions. Getting yourself pretty things gives to something to do and you feel good doing it at first. The main thing is to try and find other ways to support... Maybe working out, going for a walk with friends, colouring, etc. Something you like doing that might not cost money but will distract you.",1
"This is wise advice for this individual, when I'm distressed I start spending money. So what you're telling this person to do make sense find alternatives that give pleasure without spending money. In the end I started to go swimming, I find this a great help for calming me down that may help you.",1
It sounds like you need to work with a therapist to address your anxieties. Medication will not solve feelings of insecurity and you may be thinking it will. Your symptoms don't sound like bipolar but have your Dr do a full assessment. Bipolar depression and regular depression both suck and can last a long time if not managed effectively.,1
"i understand. i want to be normal so bad.  tired of the pills that don't work well. tired of the being exhausted from the struggle of keeping my shit together.  
see a dr. if they help even a little it's better than what you have now .  Good luck",1
"You have an illness that is trying to run your life and make you miserable.  Are you on meds now?  In therapy?  If not, please try to get help.  Depression doesn't need a reason.",1
"you mite try lexapro for depression, alprazolam for anxiety, and seroquel at a low dose for the bipolar...I have panic attacks all my life ( its inherited ) but there is nothing better than having a lil'talk with Jesus if ur a christian, or whom ever ur higher power is, I choose God",1
"Lithium for depression/ bipolar disorder  works well . I was on lithium from age 12 - 17 , last year i changed to lamotrigine for depression/ bipolar disorder  , quetiapine for sleeping,  & lorazepam for anxiety . These 3 work wonders !!",1
"I agree.  Lithium has been my wonder drug.  Research it.  I am on the lowest dose.  It sounds scary, but educate yourself on it and you'll see it differently.  I feel like it has given me peace in my life when I had never really known what that felt like.",1
"I, too, am bipolar but I have bipolar where the manic episodes are very similar to yours. Boundless energy and no patience, have to make sure house is organized and clean, etc. There are a lot of meds out there but the one that helped me most was the mood stabilizer called lamotrigine. It evens out your moods. I also take busparone to help with the anxiety and it really helps me. Be sure to see a psych specialist to get a proper diagnosis. If you can't afford one, check for free or low cost mental health clinics in your area or call 211 in any state. It is a help line to help you find services in your area.",1

Hi this post was from me just an update my gp referred me to mind mental health service I had my telephone assessment today and after forty minutes on the phone the woman told me they couldn't help. As soon as I told her I've noticed I've had symptoms of mania She said she will have to consult her supervisor because they only provide therapy not diagnosis (I get that) but she thinks I'm not fit for their services because she doesn't think I have just got depression. What happens now? I'm back in square one. Just feel upset because I'm getting sent back and forth .,1
Sounds like you could hav Bipolar 2 and going through hypomania episode but I wouldn't consider what you  describe as being full blown mania as you are very aware of what you are doing and during a mania persons  lack of insight into their behaviour and believes it is appropriate within given situation when it is very obvious that is isn't to other people.  Mania  doesn't  equal feeling good happy  or on top of the world which many people are saying here - you can feel like that but  characteristics are lowering of inhibitions impulsive reckless and sometimes dangerous behaviour or placing yourself in dangerous situations feeling invincible  really uncontrollably excitable energetic or agitated irritability racing thoughts anxiety thinking you know things other people dont paranoid beliefs psychotic symptoms include receiving special messages believing you are special powers etc.  Having said that if you go through cycling moods every few weeks you should see Dr as this more like BP2,1
"You are in a manic phase of your depression. And everything you have said made sense. Don't worry the doctor will fix it, and when you do crash it will not be good. I wish you well, you will be fine.  I know your brain is racing, as the previous lady said go to the ER. It's very important you get help quickly.",1
"Thanks Lisa, I was beginning to panic as I thought this was hypomania too. My diagnosis is bp2 I was starting to think I was bp1.",1
"Well could be either. I'm not claiming to be a Dr. I was first diagnosed BiPolar I last year. Now I'm being told more likely BiPolar II, Bcuz the mania isn't as severe and they're more depressive spells. I was, however, hospitalized once 2 yrs ago when I was just very upset. But like I've never felt invincible or done anything more than depicted above. But could be either for me - or this person, to clarify. Either way, I empathize.",1
"It all seems overwhelming... There is medicine that helps, and it's a long journey getting it dialed in.  Even then, you'll still have failures.  It's about a willingness to get up more times than you fall down.  Everything else is just background noise...  I drive on dirt roads whenever I can, and play my music LOUD! Truth, that's how I found my inner-peace.  Just gotta find YOUR dirt road.       ",1
I thought a bipolar was a bear that's confused sexually and likes to play on both teams hahaha,1
That's so true. But most people we are not sick. Shame on them,1
That's me every day  No matter what I do it  is never good enough. I try and I fail. At least my daughter's can see that I am making the effort to change. So I am making a difference to somebody. I just have to  see it in myself. Make  more  positive  changes do the right thing.  Get right  with God. Be  positive  and  don't  be  afraid to  smile,1
Anyone experience relationship guilt? You just can't be happy and vibrant like your partner and know she needs/ deserves someone like that..how do you deal with this..knowing she was happier before she met you?,1
Omg so true my ex would say things about my anxiety & depression & would put me in horrible positions around his friends he used to get drunk be sarcastic & upset me wen i got upset he would blame me cos we had a disagreement didnt help he was a narsasist,1
You blame me for my sickness and you create intense stress to keep me sicker.,1
"The high sex drive is a side effect of some medications. It happened to me when I was prescribed seroquel. I also had obsessive thoughts. I had enough after a few months and asked my shrink to change my meds. The meds I'm being weened off of now, Effexor, made me lose interest in everything. Now I'm another step closer to being completely off the friggin' things, my interests are coming back, thoughts are clearer. But I do have periods of deep depression and for some reason, I started cutting myself when the sadness is at it's worst.. I've been also diagnosed with major depression, something like 12 years ago. But something else was wrong..",1
"Never rule out you're psychic abilities too. They often represent as anxiety and occur in people who are empaths and subsequently depressed, deep-feelers.",1
"i have experienced the same symptoms as well. I had a breakdown last year. I was in the hospital for 10 days. They put me on Seroquel.  I was diagnosed with PTSD , BIPOLAR, major depression, and panic disorder.  I dont know how i would be without it. Im not gonna sit here and say how bad it is , because for now i am as ""Normal"" as Im going to be. You are not alone",1
"You know I experienced voices calling my name also. I would turn off everything in the house and then go around to the computer, stereo, T.V., etc. and listen for sound. Nothing. But I still heard the voices. I also had symptoms very similar to yours. The sexuality, spending, racing thoughts all unable to control. But I do not think I was aware that they represented something wrong with me at the time. That does not mean you do not need care. I have severe bipolar with depression and anxiety, and take a lot of meds including seroquel. I was hospitalized 4x, one a legal hold.  I've been on the seroquel for 2+ years and have begun to gain weight back after a huge weight loss when not accurately diagnosed with bipolar. I do not seem to be as sedated as other people mention.But I am very unproductive in day to day activities. I take many medications. Zolpidem, temazepam, valium, zoloft, tegretol, hydroxyzine, + more. And YES meds are expensive and have many side effects. I agree that major depression is  probably one part of your diagnosis and you are experiencing symptoms that also still need to be addressed. It is a daily challenge and a continual process. Never ending B.S. that is your life. Please keep going.",1
"Everything you described is systems that we all experience. Impulsive decisions that aren't thought through. The biggest issue is when we are going through an episode we don't recognize it. Serquol has helped me recognize when I am having an episode. I have been on it for over 15 years. It takes about three months for the medication to really get into your system and not experience the side effects. I also have to take sleep aids due to obsessive thoughts, nightmares and",1
"I take seroquel also, 400 mg. At night and 200 mg. As needed during the day for anxiety and diazepam as needed for depression and anxiety.  I am not happy.",1
"I used to hear voices but it was my own. I have bpd, major depression, social and generalised anxiety. 
But you could have anything between bpd, bipolar and schizophrenia",1
"When bipolar goes from paranoid state into psychosis, the usual hallucinations type stuff rolls. I doubt your diagnosis is going to change as you're presenting with bipolar 1 manic traits and instability of mood. Keep working with your doctors. Things will settle down soon enough.",1
The seroquel gave me severe anxiety and odd dreams been off of it for 4 years and still suffer with anxiety and depression,1
"I am diagnosed bipolar, major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, DID, and was started on 200mg Seroquel. I only took it for about 3mo because it caused weight gain and made me sleep constantly! It's taken about a year to find my right combo of medication, but now I am doing well on them in addition to therapy.

Current meds: 400mg Lamictal, 150mg Wellbutrin, 30mg Buspar, 1mg Klonopin, and 10mg Ambien.",1
"So true Derek. Seroquel is a two-faced monster. Blissful oblivion and a foggy zombie-like ""life"". I have to quit it too. But the other neuroleptica stuff have disturbing effects too. It's a drag :/",1
"The major depression is probably just one part of the diagnosis.  I am bipolar with social phobia, major depression, general anxiety disorder and stress.  It is a complete pain in the ass!!!",1
Ok I have voices in my head at night time about my past thinking of my mum and dad and friends it's like I'm there but I'm not and when I awake it's gone it's only when I'm asleep and sometimes it stops me from sleeping not sure what you call it but it can be disturbing,1
When people say they hear voices it is actual voices they hear but you can have 'intrusive thoughts' which when you have them seem to be outwith your control and can be very very strong and loud but that is not same ad actually hearing voices although can be just as distressing especially when thoughts are very ngayive or disturbing.,1
I have homicidal ideations when I get extremely agitated or irritated. I hear voices when I'm depressed.,1
Keep a mood journal. This can help a psychiatrist get a correct diagnosis. Seroquel is used in some people with bipolar. It didn't work for me. I was diagnosed with bipolar I and I had the extreme moods and voices either telling me I was better than everyone else or that I should kill myself because I am so pathetic and useless. Scary stuff. It took me 18 mths to find a combo of meds that worked with the least amount of side effects. As well as meds I saw a psychologist who did cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness. This gave me tools to help myself in dealing with bipolar and predicting when an extreme would occur. You can do a bit of research while you're waiting to see your psychiatrist. Only a psychiatrist should diagnose mental illness. All the best.,1
Lithium olanzapine and mirtazapine but please I can't stress enough. The way a person reacts to a medication differs from person to person. It is a very personal thing. All medications have side effects. I have just found a combo with side effects I can cope with.,1
"Schizophrenia displays symptoms of depression as well as psychosis (audio hallucination is common) and may explain the obsessive thoughts and Impulsive behaviour; MDD has a psychotic symptoms allowance but you dont tend to come across psychotic MDD patients that hallucinate; Bipolar (type 2 I believe) would explain the depression, impulsive symptoms and the psychosis;",1
Hearing voices are COMMON symptoms of major depressive disorder and also severe anxiety. Once you feel better you won't hear it anymore. BUT your other symptoms do sound like symptoms of bi polar disorder.,1
"I never said anyone was a liar, it was entirely read in, some therapists have a view that their experience is all the knowledge needed to work with others take a theoretical approach, while its true that someone with MDD doesnt commonly present with audio hallucinations it doesnt mean that a specialist who works more within experience than theory wouldnt contradict that statement and say that people with MDD do get audio hallucinations because in his experience he has treated many MDD patients with psychosis.
So which one is correct? Neither. Because both are right in their own scope... theory is usually more about general psychology so this is generally true; where as people learning from experience have their eye on a specific population and has specific intrests meaning they dont worry about general information but information specific to his clients",1
"Agreed Debbie and Tarnya. I have off the chart severe anxiety panic disorder, severe depression, type 2 bipolar, borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder. My bro and I live with one another and when I'm just about to drift off I swear to God I hear my brother saying ""aye candy.  Candy??"" but the thing is he's in his room snoring. After my mum passed I would hear her too calling my name. Now I hear bro. I'm not nuts am I???",1
"I'm training in the medical field and have been with the same paychologist for years and he showed me the DSM-IV-TR and he explained how they diagnose, he also told me that the psychosis that presents in depression is often Delusions (which I was having at that point, hence him explaining this all to me), he also explained schizophrenia, BPD, Bipolar and anxiety (also had severe anxiety at the time; BPD and schizophrenia because one of my relatives has those and bipolar because it was suspected I may be bipolar), my GP also explained them all to as to how they present and a basic medical run down of them.

So I dont know but I have a feeling that they dont present with audio hallucination; the other issue is MDD even psychotic MDD usually is caused by a serotonin based issue whereas when SSRIs are given to healthy people they dont tend to cause psychosis... where as  schizophrenia and bipolar both of which have depressive symptoms (which are usually treated with SSRIs) as well as psychois (treated with dopamine antagonists called antipsychotics.)",1
Ask your psychiatrist... hearing voices alone is common with MDD and severe anxiety.,1
I didn't see any symptoms at all of schizophrenia. Hearing voices in common with major depressive disorder and also severe anxiety.,1

"I feel lazy.

But it is a war, with various sized battles every day.

My wife supports me, and the kids. I haven't been able to hold a job...ever.

The longest I held a job was 6 months. That was as a cashier at Chevron. But we both hated that, and so I quit that one.

I actually did find a nice job that paid less than minimum wage...but they closed up shop and moved on.

I've tried various pills and such, and I've tried talking to people, but I've not found anything that works, and I'm afraid to try anything else, since the side effects have been (so far) permanent, and not fun. And because the people that I talk to that are supposed to help, don't care. I'm just a paycheck to the ones I've met so far.

I dunno what to do. But I'm draining my wife of energy, and I don't want to do that. She has worked so hard for the last TEN YEARS to support me. She would be much better off financially, without me. She assures me she wouldn't be as happy without me, but I think she could do much better, and be much happier.

"I had the same issue with my boyfriend - I had written in my journal about what one day was like for me - from the time I woke up to the time I fell asleep (if I even fell asleep) I wrote a stream of thought about what goes through my mind and went into detail about what gives me anxiety and my daily interactions where I have to act like I'm Susie sunshine because that's what people expect of me so by the time I get home I am too exhausted to even think, yet my mind still goes and I wrote another stream of thought - when I wrote it I had no intention of sharing it with anybody - but I got to a point where I was tired of him resenting me and telling me I was just making excuses - so i read it to him and something finally clicked in him - sometimes he will get angry - and I don't blame him for that - being with someone with a mental illness is frustrating - but his demeanor has changed a tremendous amount - I also told him what I felt he could do to help me in those situations. He is not perfect, but things have improved so much",1

Yes I feel very similar.  I was diagnosed with Mixed Anxiety Depressive Disorder.  As is my 18 yr old daughter. I've just finished treatment for my 2nd Breast Cancer in 12yrs.  I take Amitriptyline & Epilum.  I feel I am a burden to everyone  & have suicidal thoughts.,1
"Yes. My history is very similar to yours. I was diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety for 26 years. Then new symptoms appeared and I became very angry and destructive at times. Other times I was manic, high on life, an unstoppable force. I gained a lot of weight while depressed. Then I spiraled out of control with insomnia, unfocused, suicide attempt, lost over a 100#, and did not recognize myself. I was hospitalized and diagnosed with bipolar, severe. I still battle with suicide ideation often. I think no one wants or loves me. I spend time alone with my own thoughts, praying, and writing. I DO know if I committed suicide my children would definitely be hurt by my loss. They keep me going. I do not want to bring any destructive forces into their lives.My love is unconditional. As for everyone else who offers nothing but judgement and negativity block all they tell you. You are sick and people like your mom are only making your situation worse and more stressful.

"Call your state's assistance line. You can call 211 from any state to be connected to various social services. They will hook you up with someone in your area that helps get meds for free or at a very low cost. Calling a free medical clinic is also a great idea. I did both and was able to get all 4 of my meds free. Going cold turkey can set off episodes and make it difficult to deal with everyday life and the people in it. Call those places and tell them when you will run out of your meds so they can help you as soon as possible. You CAN do this! There are a lot of ways to tackle this. Don't stress out...It will work out if you find someone to help! I've had to do that twice and it worked out both times. Go online and look for a mental health clinic that serves the poor  and those without insurance. I've been going to one for over a year and they do free meds, counseling, and appointments with psychiatrists. That's your first best option. You can do this!",1

"Hi , just coming out of about of anxiety and depression, but had a dip yesterday and today, so your enquiry had very recent meaning for me. What I found helped or was at least distracting was to listen to mediations on YouTube for insomnia and anxiety to at least distract myself from ruminating. Rumination is when you have the same things going round and round in your head. They may be things you have to do, should do or things you cannot do anything about but concern you.

"My son is 16 and hasn't gone to school in a month. He is also struggling with depression and anxiety. It took me a couple of years to get him to agree to go to counseling. I made him an appointment with a psychiatrist and a therapist. He went to his first counseling session on Wednesday and he said he thinks it is going to help him and he really likes his therapist. I think when they finally understand that therapy isn't a bad thing, that is when the good happens. Just continue to be supportive and don't nag. I hope he comes around and decides to do therapy, it honestly helps more than anything. Good luck",1
"That is so sad, I'm sorry. My depression came to the fore around the same age but I didn't know what it was & no-one helped me tbh. He REALLY needs to speak to a doctor or counsellor. It's scary, embarrassing, frustrating at first BUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT. Reassure him he's not on his own, and although you don't know how he's feeling, you are there with him every step of the way. He needs people he can talk to (maybe not even someone close) & most of all, your support. I hope things get better for him. Remember, it can be chemical & not anyone's fault xx",1
"Just keep being supportive. I've battled depression (and at times been suicidal) since I was about 11, so I understand how he's feeling. And honestly, just knowing my parents knew was terrifying but a relief as well. Their support meant more to me than anything! Just keep open dialogue with him, don't judge and be patient on the days when he may be less receptive your suggestions and help. Also, though, keep an eye out for when he starts to withdraw for extended periods of time. This will likely be  when the suicidal thoughts are returning. Eventually, he WILL need to see a doctor, so don't force that on him if you can help it but keep it on the table as an option for when he is ready. (I was in my 20s when that time finally came. Wish I would've gone sooner now.) But if he starts to get worse instead of better, you may have to make that choice for him. Just be prepared. You will know if and when that time is.",1
"I think homeschooling is great in certain situations but I'm sorry to sound like a smartass ,  you're assuming a lot from the original post.

"Monday I bought a ukulele and today I can already play a couple songs. This past week I've definitely spent a lot of time loving that and practicing and not just laying in bed. Doesn't have to be that in particular but if it's music, sports, art, anything he has a natural interest in, maybe try to encourage him from that angle. But other then that you're doing good, just gentle suggestions/encouragement is best. The anxiety that comes with depression can even make love and concern seem overbearing.

"My daughter is 15 and suffers from depression. I couldn't get her to do anything like school (she still struggles with it), shopping, hanging with friends, nothing. All she wanted to do was isolate herself and stay in bed. I was at a loss. I finally sat down with her and told her that I was really worried about her and of there was something I could do. She of course told me no and to just go away and leave her alone. Well with me being a mother I told her that I couldn't just leave her alone. I talked to her and said that I knew that she didn't want to talk to me or anyone in the family so I told her that she needed to talk to someone about her feelings and how to deal with all the stuff that was going on around her and it was making her feel. I would set her up with someone outside of the family that would not judge her. All they would do is listen. I didn't use the word therapy or counseling, just someone to talk to. She finally agreed. She has been seeing her counselor for over a year now and loves her. She was also put on Prozac and it does work for her. I don't know if this helps but I thought I would put it out there.

He needs now support, but it comes from medical professionals. He is unable to make life decisions and he may push you away b/c he feels like letting you go is loving you. I know that's why I did with so many in my past. He is doing what he needs for himself right now and I understand all the investment you have made for your relationship but you must also decide if giving is Best for You! You must self love first, then love someone else. I have pushed my husband so many times to divorce me b/c I felt sorry for him. He is now learning self love and my guilt has lessen when I see him caring for not just me but himself. It's still a struggle most days but I do put him first at times to even our relationship. No co-dependency anymore. I hope this helps. God bless you for your ❤️ and for loving him. Now it's time to love yourself and that will help you decide what's best for you too, not just him.",1

And I can tell you now,  pressuring him will make him push more and piss him off. He needs time to breathe and think and focus on his health. If he doesn't want visitors right now,  respect that. I've had people try to talk to me,  pressure me, force me out the house. It just makes me mad,  all the questions and them annoying me.  I just want to be alone in the silence for a bit.

"He could be pushing back because of his depression or anxiety. I think it's very important that even though it's a very difficult time for that you understand that it's not the right time for him to make a decision. He might very much love you, but doesn't want to put you through the heartache of what he goes through & push you aw as you away because of that. I think too that giving him time & being supportive and loving he will see that you are truly there for the long run who knows maybe that's what he needs to see.

"I do not have mania, but Citalopram is working for me for anxiety and related depression. I was put on Sertraline during my recent episode in Dec-Feb, which should do the same thing - serotonin increase - but made me much, much worse. I went straight back to my GP and went on meds I knew worked for me in the past. There are so many medications and so a degree of experimentation given everyone with brain illness is different. we can call it the same thing bit we all experience these illness slightly differently and of course some worse than others. It the same for the meds.

I currently take abilify and find it to work wonders for my manic/depression but currently still have issues with anxiety.,1
"everyone is different.  They put me on a combination of medications to help with my depression, anxiety and ADD.  they work well but they may not work well for you.  Does your doctor do blood work to check the levels of the medication in your system??  Or maybe try genetic tests that look for certain genes that resist meds??",1
You might ask your doctor about Cymbalta. I was the closest I've ever been to happy when I took that medication. Does wonders for anxiety too,1
I'm on 60mg of that great stuff nailed my stress and anxiety problems does make me drowsy tho but worth it,1
I currently take 10mg. Diazepam and 200mg. Of quitiapine as needed for anxiety and depression episodes.  I have tried many different meds. And these seem to work the best. Please take care and good luck to you.,1
"I know this might sound silly, but when you get like that, try taking a really hot shower while listening to some music. Just make sure it's upbeat, feel-good music. That usually helps me when I get to feeling all pissed off and crappy like that. And don't just stand in the shower. That gives your brain the opportunity to dwell on whatever's making you mad. Wash your hair, shave, brush your teeth, etc. Anything that'll keep your mind focused on something other than what's going on in your head",1
"Let your family n friends know how you are feeling. But also know it's okay to feel how you are feeling, but also know that you are not guilty or defeated even though you feel that way. You can get through this it's okay to have friends or family help perhaps you might let them know how you are feeling, sometimes it just helps to have someone there. Things that can relax you can be walks, I suggest daytime to take on Vitamin D, also a nice bubble bath with some upbeat music, some find also to like meditation, yoga, exercise or even cooking as relaxing. Also take one day at a time, you can do this. Just take it slow, you can get through this it just takes time, be patient with yourself.",1

"WOW! You've come a long way, you just don't realize it, I think. That is, I think that you don't realize it; I know that you have come a long way. Obviously, I am also Bipolar, so please let me try to explain it in 500 words or less. Lol
What I see is a sensitive, strong, caring woman who has, despite the odds; found the diagnosis because she refused to quit searching for it. 
I also have a little secret for you. There are a  lot of VERY successful, and famous because of it, people who were just where you are in life   Careerwise until one day. . .
Walt Disney, Einstein, Bill Gates, and more. Google them. In fact, Google everything. It will tell you the same thing I'm about to tell you. Your Mental illness is caused by Brain Chemical Imbalances. That is what causes Bipolar Disorder and Depression; and that's Physical so maybe your Mother can relate to that and maybe she can't. But, it's your problem and I don't think that you can count on much help from anyone around you right now. And obviously, you know that something has to change before it just keeps getting worse, day in and day out.
I could be wrong about all this but I don't think so because I experienced the same things. All of them. Doesn't it make you mad that we make ourselves hurt physically? And doesn't it make you mad that all we want to do sometimes is sleep? And doesn't it REALLY make you mad that your not one of those people who get motivated when they get mad? At least, not long enough to get where you want to be. ""Me, too!"" I just get mad.
Well, I am going to tell you what has made differences in my life and maybe, or maybe not, you can try them and see if they help you. 
#1. Don't ever give up on God or think that God has given up on you. You are wonderfully and fearfully made. Psalm 139 In His image. Genesis 1
(Later I'm going to tell you about a Daily Devotional I came accross in Sam""s Club, of all places. It has changed my life) #2. I said earlier that this is your problem. Not because I don't know how you have tried and tried to deal with it but dealing with things or I guess I should say, not being able to deal with things, is a symptom. A Symptom of your Illness; not a Personality Trait. When people are experiencing symptoms, mental or physical, that they are unable to get relief from, they need assistance with this. There are lots of places and people that are willing to help you with the Process of Recovery from Total Disfunction. You might try to Google or search your Yellow Pages under Counseling or something similar. Ask whoever answers a phone for Assistance on where to go if not there, who to call if not them. Your School might even have Resources through the Academic Counseling Office. 
#3. When you do find who is right for you; if you still are out of school and work,  apply for Social Security Disability. You are entitled to receive Assistance with this to provide you with Health Insurance and Financial Support. This is always a timely, grueling process and you will automatically be denied several times, everyone always is. Get an Attorney right away to help you file and appeal. There are ones who specialize in assisting us and they don't want any money from you unless and until you win your case. Don't feel like your above this or that you don't deserve the assistance, that's your Illness and people who are not experiencing what you are talking. I think your family loves you dearly but they truly don't understand. Not a lot of people do; in fact, it wasn't that long ago that they just diagnosed us nuts instead of Chemically Imbalanced. Thank God for Science. #4. You already do this, never give up.
I promise to be praying for you and when you can, get this book. I'll send you some example pages. I swear, it's like, it was written for us. It's like Jesus talking right to me about exactly what I need to hear when I need to hear it. It's called ""Jesus Calling"" Experiencing Peace in His Presence by Sarah Young.",1
I took it. It reflected that the drugs that hadn't worked for didn't metabolize well in my system. It also said I would be good with benzos which is kinda true because after two weeks my body was so addicted  I to them that it took months to wean off of them ( highly addictive drugs but I didn't know that) So it was accurate. It can help you avoid things that won't be useful to you.,1
I went though 2 break down my depression was so bad and anxiety .What go me though  was eating healthy food I seen social worker and  used breathing    in and out  to help me calm and I use we go to the water a lot look over and sea waves and hear them relaxes you.And I use to take magnesium  it help your nerves and    cramps and neck pain I use to get a lot of that  from my anxiety. I went and seen a natural doctor .,1
Distract yourself by doing simple things like colouring reading watching a movie or researching. Research cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness. They are therapies and techniques used by psychologists and psychiatrists to treat depression and anxiety. You might find some ideas you can try. There are even mindfulness apps you can download. You need to see your dr and let them know you aren't doing well. You can't just snap out of it. It takes a lot of hard work but it's worth it.,1
Depression / anxiety isn't something you just snap out of... the road to recovery is a lengthy process.,1
"Yes. I've had bipolar disorder for about 55 years, but was diagnosed only about 30 years ago. I was a teacher, and the strain of putting on by happy face daily finally pushed me into a very early in retirement. I'm very hard to treat, so the best I can get is to be only functional. I've been isolating now for a long time, so I know I'm not in great shape.",1
My anxiety and depression is so bad i cant leave the house i also feel like people are always watching me,1
"Yes, sometimes. I was diagnosed at age 12 and am 31 now. It may be worse with age because there are more responsibilities to worry about. But I've been trying all sorts of medication combinations and therapy and have learned to manage my bipolar better. (I am Ultradian Bipolar - mood swings in days or even hours). It also helps to have support from friends, family and even those of us here online who also experience the same issues. We are here for you, even if we don't know you   ",1
I have suffered from depression. PTSD and severe anxiety. I can find it very difficult to leave the house aNd cant do the simplest of tasks like washing. Ive been suicidal in the past.,1
Yeah I struggle to get out too. It's definitely gotten worse the past few years since turning 18.,1
"I was diagnosed when I was 26 with bipolar and now I am 44. As I am getting older my manic episodes have been getting under control and I have been working these past 3 years. I was told by my psych Dr.,, caseworkers and my own family that I shouldn't get a job because I will relapse. Well I am pretty proud of myself because I work in the mental health field in the same place I have been receiving services for almost 20 years. I would pray so much to get my old  self and life back and it's happening.  I feel so blessed. I want others who struggle with their diagnosis to know that it's ok to feel defeated but you can never give up and we are strong.",1
I have alot of days I struggle with that too,1
"I am 31 and lived my whole life with the illness and was diagnosed at 30. As a child I always new I was not fine. My emotions were uncontrollable and i did not understand. Got bad from 25 as a result I almost lost my life. Attempted suicide. That's how I got diagnosed. I am taking my meds, going to therapy. But everyday is a struggle. I battle. I thought I should be fine by now. I have been taking meds for a year and 4 months.",1
I am struggling more as I get older. And finding so little joy lately,1
Yes I am 59 and am having a horrible mixed episode which quite seriously scares me- I had a side effect from my go to mood stabilizer and ever since life is quite the roller coaster- finally I pursuaded them to let me try it again and see if my sodium goes  to low again.  I eat salt all day long now.,1
"I have been on Viibryd for about 5-6 months I think. At first I was irrationally angry a lot. We found a dose that works for me and it seems to have been better. But I am also diagnosed with Bipolar disorder so sometimes I can't distinguish if what I'm feeling is the medicine or if I've just spiraled into an angry few days. I would say talk to your physician about upping your dosage. We did so after about 1.5 months. All in all this medicine has saved me. I was on Zoloft for 7 months and felt no difference. Viibryd helped me feel ""human"" or at least able to get out of bed more often than not. It gets better   ",1
I woz diagnosed at 47 49 now have been hosp  for 8 weeks due to a  anxiety and depression,1

How we feel is connected to what we think, 
What we think is connected to what we believe.
What we believe is connected to god only knows these days. This depends on what we were taught and Who taught us.

Happiness is a state of mind that can only exist in the present moment. 

A bad day after bad day makes a bad week, a bad month, a bad year. Bad year after bad year makes a bad life. All the fault of how we think each moment of everyday. 

Our thought habits control our present moment. Learning to control the way we think, controls the way we feel.

This book contains a sure fire method that will allow us all to understand and control what we think; which allows us to finally be in control of how we feel. 

This book will help all people to understand their emotional motivation but will be especially helpful to those who suffer chronically from Anxiety, Depression, P.T.S.D. and Bipolar Disorder.

The information contained in this book has changed my life from a 36 year intense emotional roller coaster ride into a path of daily peace, calm, stability and progress. 

I prayed to the Universal Wisdom (Our Creator... aka God) to take me out or show me the way. Preferably to show me the way but I really had my doubts back then. 

I asked for the answer,  I asked for the key to turn my life around. 
I promised I would share this answer with all who suffer like I suffered; if my answers were made clear to me.

My wish was granted. Writing this book allows me to keep that promise.

I can't wait until you are able feel the same ways too, as I am able to feel today. 

Our Past, does not have to equate our future.
Change is indeed possible and much closer than we may think.

I stand by this book, I am proud of the information contained within; it has allowed me to finally begin to enjoy each moment of everyday; instead of just reacting to it and hoping happiness shows up someday.

I know our emotions can make us needy and very impatient so this book is intentionally designed to be Succinct, to the point and as quick of a read as possible.

Yes, Yes Indeed, we can all learn how to start Feeling Better.",1
When it's actual mental illness it's not easier to play on a phone or watch a movie...why not?  Because yes it seems easier but our head doesn't let it be.  We are thinking about what needs to be done.  Why didn't I just do it?  Maybe I can just do it.  But if you try you will fail.  You're so worthless you can't do this.  Everyone knows you're worthless and stupid.  He'll even your own mom hates you.  Don't you see it everything she looks at you.  Can't you hear it in her voice.  Shit like that and it keeps going so yes I may have a netflix show on or try playing a game when I should be filling out paperwork for something that will really fuck me up later but my head is talking shit.  I'm on the verge of crying and trying not to so nobody knows I'm upset because I feel nobody cares.  It gets so bad I'm fighting myself as to whether or not I should continue wasting the space on this planet.  And the ONLY reason I'm still here is so I don't fucking up my kids.  So don't tell me mental illness is being fucking lazy,1
And i too am a percentage of laziness . With huge bouts of un laziness. But i cant seem to do those adult things. I always mean to but i dunno y i just dont follow thru. Until my mum was murdered she was amazing she gently coaxed me from my dark hole. Others try to push and threatened and gave up. A constant rock is the most wobderful saviour for mental illness.,1
"Happens to me lots days when I can't function or go out the door and many pyjama days that sometimes make me feel guilty. But it is what it is and I think because I've not been able to work for a really long time I've got no friends. And can't make myself find new ones because I'm not reliable because of a weather phobia, so I can only go out spur of the moment which is difficult and hard to have friends when you can't plan   ",1
I still am not sure what is wrong with me but my GP is treating for anxiety but ready this is helping a bit thank you,1
"I began to notice this after my last depressive episode. But I also noticed it's been happening even before that. I would normally push myself but become irritable on those days. I'm working on that now and learned how to manage it. There'll be days that I can't, though, but it's okay. I'm still starting to learn it afterall.",1
"yeah know the feeling, about every three days or maybe four my energy zaps to a very low point, which in turn makes me really miserable where I do almost nothing...

depending on who you talk to will depend on the answers, for me I monitor the activity I do and know I have to pace myself or hit a low point that can last for a few days, (Fibro sufferer)

I started taking Vitamin D3 again, and some COQ10, it helps to give the immune system a little boost, which in turn boosts the ability to cope slightly better...  

I would suggest using something like the FibroMapp app, ideal for monitoring and you can customise it... pacing yourself during the up days may also help with energy on the low days...

if you're having issues sleeping, whether it be physical or mental pain, just chill out if you can, the more you fight it the worse it becomes, the energy cycle has many factors...

lastly, have a look into yoga stretching and breathing techniques, the latter is very important to how we heal internally, plenty of YT vids around for free, the stretching is only stretching, no weights or press ups etc...  just simple stretching techniques, along with the breathing is a good energy maker... throw in some relaxing music, quietness and hopefully 10, 20 30 minutes of this will help a little, or a lot...",1
"Happens to me a lot. I try my best to stick to my routine, but it's normally be dialed back. Instead of a long run just a short easy one to get stretched out at least. If I wanted to get 3 assignments for school done that day I'll settle for one maybe two. Maybe even sneak in a nap. I really avoid just letting myself veg out all day, then guilt/anxiety about not getting anything done makes me shut down again and it becomes a vicious cycle. But keeping a consistent and nutricious diet, keeping a consistent schedule and routine but still accepting the days I'm not quite superman helps me the most. Also remembering to take whatever meds you're prescribed consistently too",1
Been dealing with exactly this for 2 years. I am on 600mg arorix. It worked really well for 3 years..saw a psych and he said it's a long process to jump off them and a 2 week wait after that to get on a ssri...so over living with this. I never feel happy let alone that JOY thing that people talk about. Totally socially phobic...and I'm a social worker...insanity   ,1
yes I have days like that..I  just sat straight up in the bed..some kind of dream...its 3:30 am...I just got up...feel a little panicky,1
Def feel for you n yes I go through this a few days a WK n its just horrible n hard when some don't understand n judge n criticize you makes your emotions n mind n anxiety panic worse. I try go for walk or call n have a yarn with someone who understands n it helps . also 2mg antanex helps in these situations for me anyway. Good luck n know your not alone . feel free to pm me when n if u need a yarn it does help . all the best darl  . truly feel for ya,1
"Bipolar/Depression/Anxiety Open Page I just cannot pretend that this will ever get better. I cannot pretend there is a purpose for this torment. grief is not a leson, it is a feeling. Pain is not there to make us stronger, it has no 'purpose'. Mental illnes does no go away.",1
hate the way mine make me feel sometimes. except the anxiety one that ones awesome,1
Ya know I didn't even realize my anxiety meds might help me chill tf out rn lol thanks xD,1
Have you seen a doctor? Youre anxiety and depression may be clinical. Looking for relief in a relationship is a recipe for disaster. You deserve medical support and a good psycoligist...especially one who understands the college stuff. Good luck x,1
"Hi. I'm 22. I have some similar history. When I was in college, my anxiety was super high, and I would miss school due to it. I even failed a class because of it and I had no motivation. First thing is to just breathe. Idk if you are on medications or anything, but talking to someone and/or going to a psychiatrist for something is nothing to be ashamed of. I couldn't function without medications. Literally. I used to work at the childcare center at my local community college. If you find little pleasure in your work, that's okay for now. You always need goals, short term and long term. It might be hard to find a passion at first. I don't know who you are, but I have a suggestion. Try something in the medical field. I am in EMS. I could not live without it. I love it. Whatever you settle for, you've got this!",1
"Heyyo, I'm 23 so it's not like I have arrived or anything, but a few things helped me when I was feeling lost and lonely and unsure about my direction:
First, I think how we've designed school and the continuity from high school to college is pretty unfair. My mom changed careers more than 5 times and she's 60 now, flourishing in yet another direction! I would strongly recommend taking a break semester or two, focus all your energy to change up your field from the current jobs you don't feel joy with, do a bunch of new hobbies, and maybe taking up a sport or a a Rec center if your jobs budget allows it. I know too many amazing people who are chained to jobs they hate because they got a degree in something they weren't keen on, and are now too in debt to experiment, travel, or start something new. Learn about yourself, what jobs you love (maybe that's just not childcare anymore, I tapped out of that gig when I was 21 XD) what jobs you can't do and hate, then build from there to see what you want to do with your day, and what kind of job let's you do that, then what qualifications you need to become the best in that field.

Second, nothing made me feel more isolated and depressed than my problematic images of college; don't get me wrong, I loved being in college and had an awesome time, but after a high school career of having built-in friends based on who was in my 20-30 people classes and watching movies about how college is a nonstop party to find your destiny and make your ""real friends,"" I felt I was doing something wrong when college was exhausting, huge, nerve wracking, and not st all like a sorority movie. You're learning how to be a functional adult, after being raised in a society that tells teens that their feelings are irrelevant and phasic while also having high expectations and giving them basically no life prep (soooo glad I carried around a bag of flour for a week instead of learning how to access birth control, and that I can do advanced calculus but not my taxes :D). That pressure, combined with the idealistic image of what college is/should be like can make you feel like a real failure! It's not true :) you're just learning how to stand, survive, and thrive entirely solo, and that's hard, and that's ok. 
Third and less helpfully, I've also had a ton of issues with relationships, often because i speak different love languages and have different needs (nice way of saying I'm depressed/anxious/needy) and have honestly found living alone with a dog to be my answer. I don't have an aversive view of relationships and will happily take one up, but have just experienced from living with partners that I am better in a relationship when I have all the space and independence of living alone. It sounds hokey, but honestly until you have no fear of living and being alone, even love it, especially if you're neurodivergent or have particular needs, partners can and will use fear of isolation to keep you in situations that do not serve you first (not even necessarily abusive, just...if you NEED them cause you're afraid of that isolation, they may not view you as precious, and may not cherish you the way you deserve. It can be tiring to be in a relationship with someone who is anxious, and I've had some partners feel over-entitled to my labor in our relationships because they ""put up with me"").
Fourth, self-care is radical. Take long baths, go for long walks, paint, sing, pet a dog, buy yourself flowers if you can afford it. The world may feel like it's closing in and crushing, but it can wait long enough for you to go outside. Those are the moments you'll really remember, the memories you'll cherish, and the substance that makes your life. School and qualifications are just supposed to open doors for you to do what you love, not loadstones or something to battle through just for that. You got this

Tl;dr: if you're not sure, take a break from college and find your passion then go back to school for that, society talks up college so we all feel inadequate regardless what we do there, get a dog and live alone, alone is awesome ;D",1
"I say try and relax about things. Focus on your school and where you want to go from there. Jobs almost always offer little pleasure, so don't feel that you need to be in love with your work (it would be better, of course, but hopefully that'll be fixed after your education is finished). You mentioned enjoying working with children, maybe find something that would allow you to continue that interest. Don't worry about relationships, like you said, you're 20. I got married at 21 and it was a disaster because I had so little life expirence at the time. There is no rush, love will happen when it is ready.",1
Don't worry about relationships. God will send him when He's ready. Learn to love yourself first. Maybe you could take electives until you decide what you want to do with college. Early education is a good field to get in to. We always need teachers. Good luck to you on your journey.   ,1
its nothing to be embarrassed about either...I feel the same way at times and most people do,1
Yes 18 yrs now to finally have an official diagnosis Bipolar 2 which I refer to as the less of the 2 evils. Right now I am struggling and I suspect its because I am so inconsistent with meds and exercise. Please try you will see a difference and trust me we never are boring,1
Thank you Jodie. My daughter suffers from depression as does my daughter in law. My son suffers from schizoaffective/Anxiety. He is actually looking at getting one also. I was diagnosed 7 years ago when I was 42. It's been a battle and some days it still is,1
"I have my alarms set to remind me, both morning and night meds",1
"nothing is in contro,l stresses me more.  I don't believe in a  higher power and I am learning that I can't control everything but the thought of having no control is too terrifying",1
seroquel didnt make me gain but it made me like a zombie....lamictal made me sick to the stomach and im weaning off prozac right now and havent felt this good in a long time...im on buspirone now and trazodone for anxiety n sleep and will be starting zoloft on the 10th,1
"Seroquel is the weight killer. When I was on it I had gained over 120 pounds in just under 2 and a half years. Since I switched doctors and this 1 took me off of that dreaded pill and switched me to Topamax, I have since lost 96 of those pounds and also feel better too. Topamax is also fda approved as a weight loss aid as it does not slow the metabolism down like most psychotropic drugs in its class.",1
I do occasionally have the shakes in my hands and the rls symptoms at night. Not enough to make me change my regimen. Never had the rash.,1
"I am on combo of effexor and lamictal as well and it is the best I have ever been, however I do suffer from the shakes, restless leg syndrome and tiredness, but haven't ever had a rash and this is the second time I have been on this combination",1
I took 1 tablet 25mg. And ended up in the emergency room. Never again. I'm scared of that stuff,1
Lamictal made me nervous and jittery.  Unable to focus or sit still.,1
I had horrible uncontrollable mood swings. I had to stop taking it after 2 weeks,1
"Being selfish, keeping good boundaries up, and try to catch yourself overthinking/worrying. Those all have helped me.",1
I was on the borderline of crisis management a month ago quit my 6 yr job during a panic phase I was shaking uncontrollably for 5 days severe anxiety so bad I'd get up and look out Windows or jump at any sound  couldn't eat or sleep for 3 days ....now I feel grounded ....,1
I am bipolar one manic depressant with severe panic and anxiety ....and yes self love can be done with practice....,1
I used to feel like that im everybody's first call when there in trouble but when i need support no one comes because i act strong people assume independent when im anything but! I learned to say no and put myself first by explaining dealing with there negative emotions when trying to help them added to mine... Like a sponge i soaked up there feelings as im really empathetic..... This year i told anyone if things in there life become toxic or stressful please take my emotional state into consideration before relying on me to fix your dramas as every time i do i loose a part of myself and one day i may be broken beyond help...... It was hard to say but i done it for myself because no one else was ever gonna put my needs first took me years to realize that. X,1
"Stop worrying about everyone else, stop worrying about society and enjoy yourself . love life and Breathe",1
"Society shapes your thoughts and perceptions as to what is acceptable and what is not, we eat it all up like a parasite  then it manifests itself in mental disorders  bc the brain and our emotions are overwhelmed.  So yes, society.  Do you, boo",1
Worry about society?  No.....,1
And that shit is so confusing and racing around in your head and 1000 miles an hour and you can't get your words out because it's just too much going on. Sometimes it's best to stay silent as you say.,1
I am guilty of all the above and it aggravates my family when they need me to remember,1
I'm on both and the memory loss sucks. I often have complete mental blanks that are frustrating and embarrassing. But it's just another side effect to put up with for the sake of health.,1
Cody Cassidy this. This is what it's like before I go into depression or anxiety,1
"I find something positive to dwell on, exercise, faith, etc. I have stopped telling myself that I am going to feel ""bad"" and this in itself has helped tremendously. You will be what you think you are, sick, sad, etc. This is not to downplay anyone on meds..just saying reading all these posts will depress anyone.",1
I am worried because this is mW ATM and having a wisdom tooth infection only makes it easier to excuse not interacting with others :p hope you are OK reets,1
"This scares me to death...but i can feel it starting up again. 
And after reading this.... I just know its a matter of time now. Im so tired of fighting everyday already.... I cant even imagine it getting worse again.",1
I avoid having a  relationship due to my depression &   not wanting to go anywhere or communicate with other people & sometimes find it hard to get out of bed or even getting out my pjs & getting dressed for the day its horrible no one understands me i have no support,1
After reading this I've realised I've being doing all of that over the last couple of weeks    now I'm worried   ,1
"I dont avoid certain conversations, I avoid ALL conversations. Other people's neuroses are projected onto my own.",1
I live in this horrible place and it's real bad some days and then it's better.  It will never go away unfortunately for me but I do have good days and I live for those and my family.,1
"Please see your gp asap, you don't have to struggle alone.  Talk to someone about how you are feeling, there are options if you don't want to see a doctor - maybe lifeline?",1
I hear some ofu say be nice to yr self but when the beast enters the room I just get so mad because I see everything through a different lens..so much anxiety I feel like my chest wants to blow up,1
Just a question who diagnoses these disorders? I've usually been diagnosed by a doctor for depression and anxiety but people around me seem think I have something closer to bipolar. I just want it worked out because I'm the same the highs are the best but the lows are super flat like I have no heart. I'm on 150mg Zoloft but it's stopped working after 5 years of slowly upping the dose.,1
"Pushing people away is part of the illness, there are a lot of symptoms in what you said that are very common. I am concerned that you are still working though, what part of the world are you living in can you not take sick leave, and get sickness pay.

From the level of stress that you're under I would suggest reducing your working hours, I know it's tough but sometimes you need to do it. I reduced my working week about 10 years ago and it has helped me no end. I would also try and find a group that you can go to say through a charity that deals with mental health. You may be able to talk it out with them. Depression is a dreadful animal, and it makes you more and more isolated, this is a vicious circle. I have had depression all my life I've learnt to deal with it the good and the bad, if you ever want to inbox me and have a chat online I'm more than happy to do that.",1
"Effexor can be a godsend for some people, but when mixed with other meds,or even by itself it can carries a high risk for causing suicidal thoughts.  Please talk to your doc. Hospitals have programs that help pay for what your ins.doesnt. I used to work in the dept. That does that. Just once you are past the crisis ask to speak to someone in either case management or social work and explain your financial situation and ask them to help you apply for whatever resources you need to cover the remainder of your bills and they will direct you to the right forms,etc.and if you need help you fill them out. I hope this helps. Finances should never prevent someone from getting the care they need when they have a crisis. My best wishes to you.",1
"A bigger dose knocked me out.  I started reading Anxiety for Dummies and praying, reading positive affirmations.  Very helpful.",1
I take 10 mg of propranolol 3x daily to keep my anxiety at bay. It doesn't make me drowsy or loopy or anything.  I have xanax for really bad days or days when I have to leave the house.,1
I deal with anxiety on a regular basis. I have to calm myself down first. Then start my breathing exercises. Usually goes away in an hour or so.,1
"I too needed larger doses of Ativan but would forget entire days so I flushed them, it was scary!",1
"Effexor! I was on Lithium for 15 years!!! But after being attacked, and not realizing the Danger fast enough, I realized it was the Lithium. It puts you in a state where you can feel neither Happy or Sad. You just don't feel anything!  Not even Fear. Since the change, I feel Awake!!!  Still have highs and lows, but extreme like they were! Also realizing that ""All People"" will disappoint you, because there ""People!""  I have been on it for 4 years now.",1
"Lithium just makes you fact, serequol makes you like a zombie, abiify have to watch I took higher doses and became confused. Lamictal seems to be what there pushing these days.",1
"Trick with remeron is to keep to a higher dosage 45-60 unless they're using it for sleep then it needs to be 7.5-30 mg....

Also found Effexor worked great for depression and anxiety added with 7.5mg remeron nightly that totals my depression and anxiety; still have traumatic anxiety but thats getting treated separately",1
"Thank you guys, I am just so frustrated. I just want to be fixed. I've been having way more bad days then good. I have been diagnosed with major depression, generalized anxiety, and borderline personality disorder. I take my medicine like I'm suppose to, and it's not helping",1
"mood stabilizers dont get rid of the anxiety or the pd so you dont feel fixed that way...some bipolar people have no comorbid anxiety or pd or trauma ptsd or ocd etc so mood stabilizers do make them feel ""fixed"" most of the time as for the rest we have something else going on most of the time...all the time",1
You may need a combination. Just be open and willing to try new meds. I'm on a combo but I'm bipolar 2 with depression and anxiety so I take extra antidepressants.,1
"I wouldn't take both of those. They are both good, but up my anxiety. I take lithium and trazadone. The lithium does make me a little sick though. I know trying all these meds are horrible and super rough. You need medication though. Keep trying  ",1
It's a side effect called akathisia. I suggest talking to your pdoc about it. It can get really bad. It's like restless leg syndrome but all over your body. Ugh. Worst side effect ever.,1
I did the same so I did go off all meds I think I'm handling the daily struggle of life pretty well.,1
"My meds got switched to Lamictal, Klonopin, Celexa and something else and I started twitching too, almost like restless leg syndrome? I'm not sure what to do either?",1
"Latuda gave me tremors. Hated it. They can become permanent. Don't quit it cold turkey tho cuz the withdrawal is horrible.
Have dr help u.",1
"Lamictal/lamotrigine was the best medication I ever tried. I picked it myself. It's an anticonvulsant that seconds as a mood stabilizer so there's minimal risk. Unfortunately I got bad physical side effects after a while but, mentally it worked. I still highy recommend it",1
"There's the ""text book"" answer & then there's the personal experiences/ symptoms that are unique to each person who has bipolar. It's a mood disorder that is unpredictable, debilitating, paralyzing with depression, anxiety, etc.",1
"In bipolar 2 it can. I was told I'm a textbook example, but its possible I have both. And why not? I also have anxiety issues, paranoia, hallucinations, scored high on an autism spectrum disorder test (unofficial but makes a lot of since), and if I didn't have bipolar disorder, I'd most likely be a psychopath (prozac numbed all emotion so I dunno if that is how I really am or if that was just the meds).",1
"Same here. For  me  it's hard because being diagnosed almost 2yrs....I still haven't come to terms with it  and living in a society where once the words mental illness  are mentioned  words like mad, crazy and nuts come to mind...I must admit I'm a bit ashamed  so I basically struggle on my own  . I've stopped going to the doctor and taking any meds  most day are good but  then the lows come and I  fight  to feel better it's​ exhausting ..The thoughts of suicide it there most days and  to ease that invisible pain  I need a physical pain . I use to cut or scratch my arm .I bit a little.It soothes me . ...Oh my I really needed to share ..So freeing.",1
"Full disclosure: I have been living with Bipolar 1 Disorder (diagnosed) since I was 15 years old. I had my first manic episode when I was 12. I will be 44 in May. I have been on and off medications. Currently on them: 1200 mg of Lithium and 150 mg of Trazodone for almost six years. In my 30 years, I have self medicated in the past with booze and drugs, promiscuous sex, stealing, driving and behaving out of control. That's just the tip of my mania iceberg. After a heightened state of mania that (for me) can last months, I have DEBILITATING, CRASHING lows that send me to my bedroom and pajamas for weeks at a time. I am extremely fortunate to have an amazing support group in my life that don't let me linger long in either state. I still deal with mania (especially when I'm excited about something) and depression (not as much these days, but I still have a day or two once a month where I'm in a funk). Medication is not a be all, end all, but it does make my life possible. Side effects of my meds can be troublesome, BUT, they are a lot more agreeable than the hell I live through without my meds. I have amazing relationships with my family and friends (no exaggeration here--I am a LUCKY woman on this front), a full-time job that I LOVE and am excited to get up for five days a week, and volunteer work that fills my heart and spirit. I have struggled to get to where I am today, but it is possible to have a fulfilling and functional life with mental illness.",1
"Me with depression and anxiety. Several police interventions, 1 legal hold and 4 hospitalizations, 2x in a partial hospitalization program. A couple of suicide attempts. Abandoned and isolated. Can't trust anyone. Can hardly function on a day to day basis. Hate this disease. Was actually a licensed independent clinical therapist before I lost everything.When I'm manic I'm unstoppable. When I'm depressed I can hardly get out of bed. What happened? People say you can still live a full and productive life with this disease. I ask how?",1
"Thanks,you guys!!I was diagnose with bipolar,anxiety,and major depressive disorder about 7 months ago and still trying to get a full understanding of my mental illnesses",1
It's been a rocky journey. ...indeed!!!I struggle alot still with my meds and therapy but I'm hanging in there...I wish you well and best of luck also,1
I learned to do tapping therapy also Chinese hand massage and pressure points to relieve stress.  I put a crystal in each cup of by bra tigers eye for self confidence and rose quartz for love as im very spiritual i also distract myself from what people are doing around me by looking out for white feathers or pennies a sighn my angels are around me. Although i do really struggle with going into my own garden to cut grass for any length of time or even open curtains most days.... I can leave my street and be in amongst strangers easier than around my neighbors most times.,1
Throw yourself into like diving into a pool. You want to swim but don't want that initial ice-cold sensation. It can make you anxious but you just grin and bear it. Warm weather is good for the mood and I believe ultimately anxiety reducing. Go surprise yourself!,1
I face the fear and do it anyway.,1
Yes i can understand as i have depression and anxiety as well as vitiligo it isnt easy at any given day .,1
"Sometimes it's a matter of pushing yourself. I know part of me wants to go out and enjoy things but the other part says no. I make a plan and prepare myself by putting a post it note on the fridge, a to do in my phone and no matter how much I don't want to do it I make myself so I can tick it off my to do list. Small accomplishments really help depression and anxiety. It's all about pushing through. It's not easy but it's worth it.",1
"I relate.I can't bring myself to go outside when I need to.And if I don't,I get upset and feel worse because I wasted another day.",1
I was on lamotragine for about a year and it worked great for me. But I guess my body got used to it or something and it randomly stopped working and since then I've been struggling for about 6 months trying to find something else that works as well as the lamotragine did.,1
"I don’t know if this will help anyone here, one of my first symptoms was allot of anxiety, depression and panic attacks, in my case related to soy lecithin. None of you realize soy could be the root, it’s in everything, and you all OD on it every day. It’s in your makeup, lip stick, cooking spray, toothpaste, mouthwash, waxes, all dugs contain soy. All pills contain soy. Vegetables and fruits at the markets anything shiny is covered in soy wax, the chickens and cows are fed soy, it’s in your perfume, is in allot of sodas, it’s in allot kids medicine. I'm severely sensitive to it, all the feeling of anxiety, panic attacks, brain fog, memory issues and infections disappeared when I removed soy out of my life, its extreme if you go that route. The last thing giving me soy was a tooth. I had to remove a root canal done because the filling in the root space contained soy. Hope this helps someone here. Soy makes you sick. https://www.facebook.com/soymakesyousick/",1
I cant even find where to write im so from manic. Depression feel like just walking yet parilsed don know where to go anyway.anxiety is up ever since I came home from my trip I find partner acting like a hole.but im guessing inthis state of mind itsprobably just misarble me just making him misarable..any suggestion im really a big mess,1
"How do I stop this horrible weight gain? My doctor won't help me, I've tried dieting, we've tried a prescription diet pill, I've been so depressed I've eaten one time a day, at work I'm on my feet all day, I don't go to the gym and work out it's not my thing ever. I'm also on Prozac, topamax, trileptal, inderal, nuviguil.    I weigh the most I ever have and that makes me more freaking depressed",1
If you have high blood pressure there is only ONE diuretic that you can take with lithium or you will stop making urine an start retaining such huge amount of fluids that you will get elephantitis.,1
I don't have any works perfect for me never fort I be me again and yea I'm back as me but I dose put on weight but don't let that scare u,1
Took it for one month. Made me very shakey and dizzy,1
"Thank you so much.  
Abilify has a lot of side affects including weight gain.  I truly hope he takes me off the abilify.   I'm already taking amitriptylin, cymbalta for depression/anxiety.  I'm have a total of 17 medications.",1
Avoid sudden changes in doseage gradually is better,1
"I LIKE TO SLEEP A LOT ,WHEN I GO TO BED ITS LIKE IVE TURNED OFF ALL THE WORRY AND STRESS",1
I hadn't cut for 5 years but last week I ended up cutting myself. Hoping I don't decide to again cause of this struggle of getting my Medicaid reapproved because the state has not yet accepted it yet so I can get my mood enhancers so I'm not flipping shit.,1
Yes I know I cry eating i look constantly in the mirror and when i eat I feel upset because I ate i try to eat Broccoli and tuna or oatmeal but I also love chocolate too much and I really really want this to stop i cant keep harming myself like this,1
small steps...baby steps...it's not failure...it may not even be a total relapse - strongs...it's never easy when things get overwhelming,1
I don't cut but I do self harm by scratching myself.  Sometimes I don't realize it and sometimes I do.  I've drawn blood many times and then will pick the scabs.  My therapist and I are working on it but its really had to break the habit because when I have anxiety attacks I'll break out in hives and itch really bad.  Has anyone suggested alternate ways to focus your need to self harm??  I have yet to find something to distract myself.,1
That's whst I do to. But now not allowed tattoos so I'm struggling again not to self harm,1
"It's not as easy as a lot of people think, even ex-cutters. Some people don't have as much as a daily struggle as certain other people. I know for myself and quite a few others I have met, it is almost an addiction like alcholism or drugs, for various other reasons but it can cause similar symptoms when it comes to withdrawal etc. What you need to realize is, this may make it harder for the next few weeks to hell even months of getting back on the horse of no longer doing it, but don't stop trying. Just breathe, pick yourself up, and start running after that damned train that left you behind. There's no reason you can't be amazing and great, at the moment just shoot for something a bit simple, shoot for not cutting for a week. Every week you don't cut allow yourself a treat you don't often get. Whether it's chocolate, special coffee, something really simple and cheap. Once you hit that month mark, buy yourself a dinner out. Tell someone, whether it's someone who personally knows you or not, tell someone who knows how hard it is so they can correctly celebrate with you. Once you hit that six months, I do something like alcoholics do, I buy myself a token of some sort to mark the day... then I buy a different one for a year and so on. I usually do something really geeky because I am a geek, and do something with pokemon and evolutions. Just remember every time you feel the desire, there are other ways to get the release. May if it will help, write down your other coping strategies where you keep your cutting tool? If you want feel free to message me on facebook. I will happily be that person to celebrate a no-cutting week with you. ^^",1
Look for another job that is less stressful.,1
"I've also done this before. I was so busy doing something else and don't respond to my friend's messages but I didn't mean to make her feel like I don't care. I always read her messages and it always makes me happy but when it's time to reply, I get overwhelmed. I don't know where and how to start eventhough I've already responded to them in my mind. So I always end up not replying and that made her feel like she's not important anymore. That I've made new friends and don't need her anymore but that's not true at all. Yes, I've made a lot of friends but it's diferrent. Those new friends, although I value them, are not as important as her. So if you've been there through the hard times, I bet your friend has already thought of how precious you are but some of us just suck at showing/expressing it and I think it's the same with your friend. So I really hope you stay with him. He needs you more than you think. But of course don't stay just because he needs you. Stay because you want to. He'll appreciate that more(I assume. Since most of us don't want people to stay just because they feel obligated.). And if you really wanna get his attention back, tell him how you feel. Or if you can't tell him, maybe ignoring him would work? That's what my friend did. She didn't just ignore my messages, she also unfollowed me on twitter. I got so paranoid that time. I thought I've gone crazy, thought she's not real, that my mind just made her to make me feel better, that I thought I have a friend but I'm actually alone. It's terrifying but that made me become more aware of what she feels and realize she's not like me who's okay with no communication as long as I know she's there(and she's real lol).",1
"Really difficult to enquire without putting on, or seemingly to put him under, pressure. If in mania, maybe wants to blot out all things associated with his depressive episode, which unfortunately includes your kindnesses. You could write expressing your wish to be there whatever, but it's his call and if it doesn't come you have to understand and respect that. Try to find out more about the psychology of sufferers a bit more, but note we are all different. There is no one catch-all description of behaviour, everyone behaves differently, however mind- boggling to may be to you.",1
"It is wonderful how supportive you're being, please keep doing it - as long as it's not negatively affecting you. With my depression I often shut people out and it's awful to watch friendships die, but being powerless to do anything to stop it. I feel so blessed when I've been super distant from people due to anxiety and depression, but several people continue to text and call and when I'm ready to talk they're available and nothing between us has changed. You are a wonderful person for not giving up on your friend",1
"I've done this before.  I'd get manic, be hyper active, going out, etc., but wouldn't feel up to socializing with those I cared about most - for various reasons.  You are a true friend to stick it out through the highs and lows.  But also remember, being a good friend doesn't mean you have to feel you bear any responsibility for his well being.  Sounds as if he hasn't made the leap to medications yet.  There will be times when the friendship feels heavy and one sided, if you need some time so you don't feel burnt out, take it, it will help reaffirm your friendship. 

It took me until my 30's to get 'stable'.  I was a huge flake due to my anxiety and depressive episodes and then everyone would think I was crazy when I was manic and avoid me... so I avoided them instead.",1
"It replaced it for me, MOST of the time.Over the last 15 yrs. I have had periods of deep depression or where rarely the mania would rear it's ugly head and I would have to take a low dose of  ext.release lithium for a while until things got back under control. I also have Fibro, PTSD, and a blood clotting disorder that can cause strokes, severe migraines and blood clots. I take anxiety meds and Cymbalta as well daily. When I first went on the Topomax i was severely overweight,  the topomax helped me remedy that in combination with a good diet. I lost over 100 lbs. in less than a yr.,so quickly in fact that the doctors said I'd lost too much and made me gain some back =~p. Lithium seems to be the only drug (I'm allergic to alot of others) that can fairly quickly help me to be myself again. I hope this help. Good luck to you.",1
I just want to say you are one brave strong and amazing person for opening up and coming for help. I was diagnosed bipolar anxiety and panic attacks 2 years ago I still have those thoughts...those demons still always try to escape and ruin everything I have and sometimes I almost let them win..but go to him let him help you fight those demons as much as he can...he can make you stronger...you have more strength then you know....get your head up lift yourself up you can do it....I'm fighting them as well right now..... just know.....YOU CAN DO IT......She's proof you can walk through hell and still be an angel,1
"Unbelievable!! Whoo!!      First thing first I want to appreciate you being so opened minded. I've living with bipolar, anxiety, and major Insomnia, and depression. I will be very honest, I was like that many years ago. But first things first we must accept, admit our mental illnesses. Only us indidviuals​ ​whom are living can only explain to our soulmates. But we must conquer, defeat, discipline our minds, thoughts. Yes, it's very hard but mind over matter. If we driving ourselves insane, crazy; I can imagine our loved ones that don't deal, cope w that illnesses. Pray my friend, Be strong, focus on daily days being at ease, jolly, content. I know it's very hard but this is one way to express our thoughts, feelings, expression. What I do first thing I wake up. I thank the man, my savior Jesus thanks for another day of life! Then focus, staying positive, keep away from NEGATIVE human beings.. Really! I will keep supporting all my friends to give them strength Support and never give up!  Remember today is gone, perhaps tomorrow is not promised! Love yourself, respect yourself, forgive yourself, believe yourself and faith. Talk to Jesus ask him w all your heart & soul for strengh and Plenty of patience.. Remember we're all God's children! He loves us unconditionally! God is good all the time to everyone! No matter what good or bad situations were dealing in our lives! Stay strong to survive!      ",1
"Topamax for my migraines and it has done nothing for my weight.  Cymbalta for my anxiety, nothing for weight either",1
"I'm on Topamax for migraines. I've lost about 15 pounds in just over a month, my taste buds are completely different, and my appetite is shot, so even though I've basically been stuck on bed rest because of spine surgery I lost the weight. It's rough to titer up on, and it's not called dopamax for nothing. But if you can stick it out some of the dopey issues gets better. I'm still losing weight, the food aversion and taste bud issues are still there, but I'm learning what I can tolerate and what I can't. Avoiding sweets and fatty foods helps a great deal, it seems to not agree with Topamax, I've been eating a lot of veggies, grains, less meats, lots of water, no coffee. It makes me be healthier or it doesn't let me eat it or drink it, and I honestly crave the healthy stuff. I do have issues with some fruits though, again it's the sweet aversion thing. I've heard some people who lost nothing, felt nothing, some who couldn't handle it at all, I admit the first few weeks were rough. It does depend on your dose as well.",1
"Took it for 2 months last year for Fibro and migraines. Really kick started my weight loss from the weight I gained on Gabapentin. But it made me severely nauseous and I had major food aversions. So when I dropped 12 pounds in 60 days, I was taken off.",1
"I am on Topamax for m.igraines too. It also helps me sleep. I am Bipolar with anxiety but I take other medication for that. I did drop some weight; but, it was not significant.",1
The weight gain is what scares me.  I've already gained 35 pounds and feel awful.  I don't need more weight gain,1
Nothing to be worried over but it elevated my white blood count,1
You need to push to see a psychiatrist or even just call simaritains and talk... I overdosed on baclofen a few years ago and as they relax the muscles my heart rate practically stopped. Worse than that my 17 yr old son came home to find me sitting in the hall terrified i was seeing writing appearing on the wall all negative things i could hear music and shouting no one else couldn't by luck my son had a support worker he called who manged to talk me into going to hospital and convince me what i was perceiving to be real wasn't happening... I was told at hospital overdose triggered a psychotic episode with severe paranoia and had to be prescribed medication for  the normal use of scitzophrenia for two weeks till the hallucinations stopped....... It was the most terrifying experience iv ever had.... Id never be as silly again i shudder to think what i could have done to myself or others if my son had not returned home and knew something was way wrong with me. X,1
I struggle everyday  with a disease over dosed twice within a month and died both times and to be honest  I feel medicine can make it worse we are all Ginny pigs it can take years to find the right meds if there is one I chose  to do what makes me feel better not  what they think,1
I would talk to your psychiatrist. I was really struggling with my bipolar depression and my meds were not really helping me. I was feeling like you. After consulting my psychiatrist I decided to give ECT a try. It seems pretty extreme but ultra brief ECT has turned my life around. I feel so much better. There is also TMS which is working wonders for lots of people I know.,1
"I'm so glad I read this article. I plan to subscribe to the magazine also. I related to all 20 & a have a few more. I have always been told that I am so negative, since I was young. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After years of taking meds, I decided to take myself of them. I didn't like the way my brain felt, it was almost numbing which I called zombietized. I feel much better off those medications. I would not recommend that others follow & copy this method. When I find myself feeling like mood is hanging out to long, I usually avoid socializing altogether.",1
This is me 110% I'm in a down swing right now and can't stop it. I don't know how to control it nor do I have any coping mechanisms. I've been diagnosed with this but so far I haven't been able to treat it because I refuse medicines. I get scared of the side effects,1
I agree with this - but I wonder why we feel so guilty or lazy- is it the need to please?,1
"I hear you. I had 2 baby boys, a workaholic husband, and chronic depression with anxiety. My toddler was an early riser and would wake baby brother up. My baby was premature and on a 3 hour feeding schedule and could not suckle.  Exhaustion is probably putting it lightly. I found it so difficult to find time to rest, and had insomnia that I was dragging butt all the time. Try all avenues  to find a means to get good sleep. Maybe someone could watch your children or they could stay with a relative. Do this as a necessity, top priority, for you and your family. You are essential for their well-being and for that you need to feel well and rested. If Mom's not happy, nobody's happy. Simple credo , hard to do. I wish you  sweet dreams!",1
"Very well said I don't have any of these illness but someone very close to me has and I've being consided crazy to the people around me because i didn't believe that if he got medicated that we were just gonna wake up and things were gonna go back to normal. I wish it could work like that I really do 
But very well said need more ppl not being afraid to admit it",1
"Sorry you have been treated like that. In my experience I've had to be very firm with Drs in order to have them listen to me. I know my blood pressure increases when I have high anxiety and I still take blood pressure meds and it's normal now when my anxiety is under control. Take a mood journal outlining your moods and anxiety for at least a Fortnight and take it to your dr. Do you have an at home blood pressure machine? I take my
BP twice a day or more often if I'm not feeling right like during extreme anxiety and take that too. If you don't have one I know some pharmacies here in Australia will take bp for free. If none of that works it's time to change dr.",1
Totally use to having extream anxiety with depression and being manic non stop. Glade I don't have a tail . I'm always forgetting what I'm doing and going in circles feels like lol,1
"I hate having both. Anxiety is a constant for me, and it always has been. Depression comes and goes, but when I have them both at the same time, I feel like a walking contradiction. Desperate for connection, yet I want to be alone and not talk to anyone. My body is tired but my mid is tangled with everything that I didn't do, and how badly I might have messed up what I DID do. Having both is truly what nightmares are made of. I have pushed so many people away over time... I go from one extreme to another... one minute I'm crying the next I want to rip people's heads off.. I just don't know what to do next...",1
"Its actually like you want to do something, anything, just to get you out of that dark depressed feelings, but you are too anxious to do anything! even if you make some plans you cancel them because you get too anxious and if God forbids if you have social anxiety like me too! I love meeting and talking to people it helps me to feel less depressed and more alive, but it like my mind is on constant stress making duty!",1
I feel you i have social anxiety bipolar with more depressive episodes as well as ptsd and regular every freaking day anxiety.,1
"I hate having both. Anxiety is a constant for me, and it always has been. Depression comes and goes, but when I have them both at the same time, I feel like a walking contradiction.

Having both is truly what nightmares are made of.",1
"Medications can do that, but anxieties such as being overwhelmed.",1
"Nope!! I was impatient hospital 4MONTHS and my wife came every single day. Went to counseling,
Read bipolar and anxiety books. Had two years doing well then this past year was impatient a week. She came every day. IN SICKNESS and IN HEALTH! You deserve that and you'd do the same for him!! (((Hugs)))",1
"Turning the tables. He steps out on the marriage, & tries to guilt you for his infedelity. Sorry for such a betrayal.",1
"I've never been married as I'm 18 but I have been cheated on a few times, I can understand how upset you must be right now, the best thing to do is try and keep going as best as you can, time will heal old wounds x",1
"I understand except with me, my best friend is the one with the problems. She blames me for everything and lashes out at me and lies all the time. She has borderline disorder and schizophrenia so I know it's not her fault, but it still hurts and people left me because I complained too much and had too many problems as someone who has Aspergers, anxiety and depression so I understand what you are going through.",1
"I do the same thing. But my so called Dr. does not take me serious, so I don't know. I take benadryl to sleep but the the nightmares are horrible, and the next day I am an a hole and a half. I'm at my wits end myself.",1
"Medication treats the symptoms not the cause ...yoga meditation really works and I unexpectedly found help in my new misfit watch that tells me what activities I have done, including swimming and the sleep pattern I have.  It helps to see what I've actually done and has made me more relaxed around sleep.  It's as if I am waiting to find out what it was rather than stressing on it at the time... daft but it has helped.",1
I struggle with this also but for me it goes back and forth.   Of course my husband thinks when I can't sleep I must be manic.  Can you be manic only on that outward sign?   I get up usually and sit and read to keep my thoughts on a subject rather my thoughts going around and round.   Music also helps me and a hot bath an hour before bedtime.  I pray you find relief.,1
"I'm struggling with this as well, I'm still getting help for it as it's nothing seems to be working. CBT helps, try reading or listening to music so that you can imagine something in your head, then close your eyes and think of that, after a while you will hopefully fall asleep - hopefully :') it doesn't work with everyone",1
"I take seroquil, geodon, and depakote for my bp symptoms which includes seeing things and hearing voices that aren't real and I get really paranoid.  I need to sleep or my symptoms get really bad.  I have been taking Ambien and hydroxizine to sleep which has worked great for me.  I am finally getting my life back together and just got a new job and place to live that will be ready in two weeks.  Unfortunately,  my Dr. Misread my file and discontinued my ambien which is the only thing that works.  I am completely out and she won't be in until Thursday.  No one else will write the script because it was discontinued and I had to move out and my new place isn't ready yet. So, I am sleeping in my car tonight.  I am exhausted,  but I can't fall asleep and I am paranoid that something bad will happen if I fall asleep.  I have no money and I am scared.  I feel defeated.  Why did my Dr have to risk my mental health by changing up my meds when I am the most stable I have ever been and why can't my place be ready now? I am doing my best to change my life,  great things are happening,  but now this? Why?",1
"I use lavender candles, bubble bath, carpet deodorizer, everything and it creates a calmer environment sometimes and help calm me.  I read somewhere that lavender helps with anxiety and helps calm your brain down, and so far I've had a lot of success with it.",1
"I take lorazepam. It helps my anxiety and controls my racing thoughts. I've tried sleep meds and anything containing dyphenhydramine, it doesn't work. I understand your frustration.",1
Benadryl. I tried trazodone made me paranoid and really didn't help with sleep. I heard Seroquel helps some people.,1
"I am on Prazosine for my PTSD.  It is helping but stress does work against me. 

What I need to do is start a bed routine where I take my meds about 2 hours before I needs to go to sleep. Then no TV or stressful or mind activities like games on my phone or TV. Quiet music and reading and snuggles with my kitty are perfect. Meditation with 4 - 7 - 8 breathing is one I am working on 

Stopping watching TV is a hard one for me though 

I know it is tough to shut our minds off. Mine will not without medication. Sometimes I will think of a story to tell myself and then just work on it night after night. It usually relaxes me and puts me to sleep.",1
"My psychiatrist prescribed trazadone. It's in the anti anxiety family. It does not help me sleep. But I take it and go to bed and what I do sleep is restful, peaceful. It helps my mind relax",1
"Me too but start low 
I have also the do it but i start less than a half because i am.in fear about medication every day i have aniety every morning 
I go to work feel a holl day aniety
Not good
So doc tell me please take it 
Chut you mind bit off 
And this i need",1
My hubby takes that and he swears by it I need to go on medication to because I suffer from anxiety and depression but am scared of the side affects it has I know I shouldn't but it's something that I'm paranoid about,1
Syraquil. I use it at night. It helps with anxiety and a side effect is drowsiness. It doesn't intensify your dreams either.,1
"Yes, difficult to set a routine that is suppose to be healthy for stabilization and recovery. I hate the uncontrollable crying!",1
Hi I was on those I felt they helped me sort of but when I had episodes I felt they were more intense. The doctor has taken me off them as I am pregnant but I'm not coping well at all he's give me others but they don't do anything I've been close to crashing my car into anything signing myself into the hospital. It's hard to explain to people how your head feels and no one understands. I've tried to take a lot of overdoses. I've been through so much stress and crap in my life I am surprised I'm still here! Have you tried talking to your loved ones or have they tried talking to you? I'm always here if you want to chat x,1
Hmmm. Eyti Nyebe the struggle is real!   ,1
Ok but now I'm stressing out that my brain isn't functioning correctly         ,1
This just stresses me out more. Ugh!,1
Stephanie Albright Johnson Memory!! Maybe stress just destroyed that neuron.,1
Probably why I can't remember shit cause I was stressed my whole pregnancy   ,1
Well then I'm fucked. I've lived in a constant state of stress for over half my life.,1
Liz Broughton May be because your work is stressful?,1
"Well, I'm screwed! Explains the memory and control part!   

Glen LOL I'm such a little stress head   ",1
My anxiety has been driving me crazy!!!!!!!!! Going on 2 weeks because the dr cut down on my Meds I ran out already & my mind is racing 150 miles per minute!!!!!!!  I feel horrible I think I should go to the ER room   ,1
"Only in front of those that are very close to me, not strong enough for anyone else to see me that vulnerable",1
"I don't wish this mental illnesses on Anyone, not even my enemies. I feel like I am inside a box, barrel and can't get out because I suffocate, can't breathe... I tell, scream and no one can hear me!! It's a horrible nightmare that I have major panic attacks....",1
I wish I could be more open about my BPD. I don't mind talking about anxiety/depression but the BPD stuff makes me sound like a psychotic sociopath tbh.,1
I wish this worked for panic attacks. I begin puking and sweating and faint before I even know what happened. Cute meme tho,1
Or...especially after the night I had at work last night...try this: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3826369/Creepy-clown-gets-beat-baseball-bat-tries-scare-group-friends-hanging-car.html  ;),1

You are a very brave and strong woman because you had the guts to do that and not hide away. I know about the hole. Once you've been it you're always scared of it, especially because you've got responsibilities, and can't afford to go back because of them. It's always terrifying because they don't mean to cause stress but they do and some days you're just holding on for dear life to get through and avoid the hole. I guess I'd say if you can find some relief, some help, so you can take quality time out for yourself to catch your breath and feel refreshed, that's very important for you. You need real breaks and time for you and your mental well-being. You also need to make sure you're getting lots of good quality sleep my friend. Rest is so important to staving off depression. Keep in touch!",1
"Acupuncture was soothing and calming for myself. I was told I looked like a different person after a session. My pain was lessened and my focus enhanced, my body relaxed. I was at peace. I also used Eastern Oriental medical herbs and compounds. This of course, sadly, was not covered by insurance. Chiropractic medicine is also helpful in whole body restoration for myself and is covered by insurance. I still take meds for bipolar also. The combination of complementary medical interventions are very helpful for me. One incident I can relate to you is that unknowingly I had not been taking my Tegretol for 3 weeks and ended up in the hospital as my mental health rapidly decompensated until I was nothing but uncontrollably enraged.",1
"I take various meds of different type. I don't view the world of my brain as having one end all and be all. My meds that I am on now were not fixing everything. I had too many hormonal shifts that were also causing huge bipolar mood swings. I couldn't find an oral contraceptive or medication that helped. So I switched to doing medical herbs to help control the hormonal shifts, I am on... 4 different types of actual psychiatric meds as a cocktail and they are realtively low doses. I also take xanax if needed. I do yoga, exercise, essential oil therapy, have my service dog, and do various other things for coping mechanisms. Honestly when my meds are off I have still found my stability is far better because of all the other things I include in my regime and it often helps me from getting too bad.

I also don't try to stop certain types of obsessive thoughts and instead direct my obsession onto productive projects I have.",1
"I am also Bipolar 2 with ptsd and anxiety disorders. I'm under the care of a psychiatrist. I take Remeron, Trazadone and Xanax for anxiety. I'm 53 and have been bipolar my whole life. I have taken almost every med out there. I also wish you well! Please keep me posted on how the 5HTP works out! ❤",1
A friend of mine uses that and says it helps her. Good luck with it ... I myself am bipolar 2 and I need a mood stabilizer and something for anxiety .. sometimes it takes awhile and some trial and error to find what meds work for you. I wish you well ❤,1
That's what I'm going through. I'm blah and have no motivation. The thought of cleaning my house is overwhelming so I do nothing. I have shut myself off from friends and family. I have severe anxiety so even the thought of talking makes me so nervous. So I don't call anyone,1
"I'm feeling the same way.  It's been a long while since I've been this depressed. My anxiety level is out of this world. Been on same meds now for bout 9yrs, I know they aren't working anymore so it's time for a change. I can't sleep, maybe if I could it would help. Diagnosed bi- polar 22yrs ago and it's been horrible at times over the years. I feel so lost and alone right now. I hope you get to feeling better. I pray I do too",1
"I'm with you, the winter was horrible and I'm trying to be motivated, but it just isn't happening. All I want to do is sleep   ",1
"I didn't work for 3 months now, did very little over that period, but fortunately 'back' over past fortnight. Be kinder to yourself. It is what it is and it's horrid but it can pass. Sometimes it is very little victories, listening to a mediation, doing a child's crossword, listening to your favourite comedy. Be kind to yourself.",1
I also feel this sometimes though. Like of course I'm grateful to have these medications but I occasionally get angry and bitter that I can't function without them. It seems unfair to have to try so much harder than most just to feel like a person. It's not that I dislike taking the medicine but rather I am bitter that I even have this problem in the first place and if something ever happens to my medicine I would be a total wreck within a few hours. It makes me feel weak and vulnerable. Idk if maybe this is along the lines of what you were feeling?,1
I feel the same way. I stopped taking them. Been taking pills for depression and anxiety for 20 yr. Now they still couldn't find the right ones. So I have the right to give my organs a break. But I feel ya about meds .,1
"I wish I had the answer. Just know you're not alone. I've been like this a lot myself, the past few months. It finally got to where this week I went on FMLA / Short Term Disability from my job til June 15. That's been a huge relief. Right now I'm trying hard to at least do one thing a day. My Bipolar ""all or nothing"" makes me struggle to keep up with housework Bcuz I feel like I ""have"" to do it ALL in one day and that's too overwhelming. My first step right now is trying to tell myself do it lil by lil. We'll see. Hugs.",1
Lorasapam is a weak drug . They give Xanax for that type of anxiety Hun . Each nerve pill or drug like that is for different things . Zanax is a powerful sensitive  and do not ever just stop taking it because this drug can kill you if you withdraw suddenly from it. Talk to your doctor. It takes that anxiety right away.,1
Sorry to hear that. But sounds about right. I'm afraid to go to doctors because I'm also bipolar and have bad anxiaty . and they will just say ur fine or just boot u out the door. I hope u have a good weekend and wish I had the ancwers u need to help .,1
"Oh dear my friend, I feel so badly for you. All I can tell you is about me really. I'm prescribed lorazepam, and I stagger it in the evening. For anxiety I take a mood stabilizer, lithium, 3X a day, and another mood stabilizer at night that is good for anxiety called Zonisamide. Maybe ask your doctor about these drugs because my anxiety is under control. Good luck!",1
I was diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression when I was just 11 and everyone says to me that I am no depressed just upset . But I just don't want to smile as I have nothing  to smile about anymore and am not intrested in the things that I used to be intrested in.  My behaviour changed when I was just 7 but I didn't think anything of it until I was 11 and then I knew and 24 now still fighting it,1
you are not alone.  many people suffer from anxiety and depression.  we feel the same way.  see a doctor and let them prescribe you meds to take.  you'll feel better...,1
"I agree you need to see a doctor. Please get diagnosed. There are medications to help you, counslers to talk to. There is hope there is great amazing things for you. Take the time to help yourself. Is there a magical cure for bipolar no. I color in adult coloring books and journal to help with my anxiety. Its ok. I felt the same way ssshhhh dont tell anyone because of fear. If you share and speak about it the fear hasn't one. You are strong you can do this!          ",1
Thank you all for your help and advice it's nice to know there are people in the same position as me. Maybe when I next meet with my doctor I won't be as nervous to mention it as I'm clearly not the only one   . I never wanted to go to the doctor trying to self diagnose myself because of the stigma attached to mental health but I figured if I just tell my doctor these minor details about myself she can point me in the right direction x,1
Please find out if you are bipolar. This is very common behavior for someone with bipolar. If you have bipolar you can work on a plan to address this behavior. You may not have bipolar but if you do you should be addressing it properly instead of treating depression and anxiety exclusively.,1
I take Trintellix for depression works good took time but i like it and Ativan for anxiety and other bipolar meds but those two are really good,1
"I flush mine down the toilet then cry about how miserable my life is, then I'm happy 5 mins later. Lol",1
I use my phone alarm. Goes off twice a day.  :) you get the best results out of your medication if you take it on time everyday :),1
I set out all my meds on Sunday's into a container and have an alarm for each time of day.  No excuses for me.  Only health.,1
They have lids for your med bottles that actually have alarms and remind you to refill. You can find them at your local pharmacy.,1
The key is routine. All phones have alarms. I used to use mine as a reminder. I now have my routine and I never miss. It takes 21 days to create new habits/ routines.,1
"My P.T.S.D, Major Depressive Disorder, Severe Social Anxiety, and the catastrophic fallout on my total mental and physical health all make me avoid most social sittuations, now. I have my doctors, other supporters, a daughter, a mom who also suffers, and a few solid,  stable friends. But , Support like this online is also one of my daily life-supporting measures at this most frightening time...",1
I seem to feel I'm offending people socially and avoid contact. Making the matter worse.,1
"Seriously I did 3 months and I have been so fine, I came off meds, I'm currently doing another 2 Months (after a year) to lose the last of it but the 12 months between doses I had 1 episode of hypomania (so not full blown) and no depression with reduced anxiety, and that's on no psych meds except occasional valium for anxiety triggers (ptsd)",1
"I have just finished a months worth and just got prescribed 1 more month and I TOTALLY understand how you are feeling. It has made my bipolar almost non existent (well it seems like it) no anxiety, depression or manic. I'm thinking clearer and everyone in my family and close circle of friends have said I am the best I've been in 13 years and only my mother and sister know I'm taking duromine. It's insane I wish there was something we could do to keep it up. If you find out a solution let me know please. Good luck with weight loss and bipolar battles",1
Be careful. Duramine is speed and can increase possibility of mania. My psych won't put me on it because of that fact. It's too risky. It shouldn't be used as a psych drug. It's purely approved for weight loss and not any psych illness. I'd really speak to your psych about it.,1
"My husband has been prescribed it for weight loss but unfortunately it's had side effects. He's not the same person anymore. He's paranoid, angry and he's begun smashing things in our house. He had no mental health issues before the medication. He thinks I'm plotting against him and I hate to admit it but im scared. He refuses to believe he has a problem. The man I love is now a stranger to me. I'm making him come to the doctor with me tomorrow but I suspect he'll just keep denying it regardless of what the doctor says. Please think twice before taking this medication. Yes you'll lose weight but that may not be the only thing you lose.     ",1
"Everyone reacts differently to certain meds.... I did horribly on Wellbutrin, it made my anxiety worse yet others do great on it.",1
"As I said, weight loss is initially the reason I'm on it. The other effects are just bonuses at this stage. I'm only allowed it three times a week to avoid dependence & resistance.",1
"Just because society has told us that mental illness is a horrible life, does not mean it is a death sentence. Nor should we embrace the labels. I hate having to wear my mask, but I am striving to become stronger so that I can take it off. I am who I am. I am NOT my mental illness",1
"This is a core question many ask in the depths of their illness. The curse is that whilst the illness is 'real' for the sufferer, the reality of the actual world may not be as desperate. It does not help that we are surrounded by such a negative media, only reporting the bad stuff of life and the world we live in. Why do public sector broadcasters in the UK or USA not broadcast positive news. The UK's biggest supporter of those experiencing suicidal feelings - Samaratins - would argue that providing time and space for people with such feelings to talk, unjudged, and explore them, can bring new perspective and outlook to move away from the deepest darkest thoughts. Unfortunately for a very few no relief can be found and suicide provides the ultimate escape from the pain. Reducing the stigma and taboo that still persists on brain illness needs to be tackled. In the UK, the NHS does not provide the necessary preventative public health work, because the Government will not find in this area, which is the biggest single health issue affecting us socially and economically. As a populace we remain in denial out of fear to open up about this. Many face their daily struggles in silence and isolation. There are alternatives - dare we fight for them?",1
"Yes we should fight for them. Here in America in my town our hospital 20yrs ago a doctor told me that here we tend to sweep mental illness under the rug. I recently to a razor down my arm  and went deep and long ways . It was bad . They stapled it back together. They were holding me to send off to a mental unit some where . The nurse told me we don't treat phyic patients here! And if you try and escape we will  lock you up in a room. Well that set me off and I left without notice. And was listed as a missing person. I had hit bottom once gain . I survived . I'm 59yrs. Old My illnesses started in my early 20s. . Anxiety , Depression and now bi polar disorder.",1
"One, because it will not only hurt you but everyone who cares about you for a long time. Two, because if you don't get it right you'll probably end up worse off than you are now. Are you willing to risk it either way? They're the only reasons I am still here. Plus the fact death could be worse... you never know.",1
My daughter is the main reason I'm still here. Although I struggle with this questions all the time!,1
Because it will not always be agony. If you stay strong you will have a day so beautiful it will be worth it. I stay strong for those days even though every day is a struggle.,1
I am fearfully and wonderfuly made. I Am Me and GOD LOVES ME,1
It's us a struggle as a parent of a child with multiple mental illness.  The struggle is real and also affects the other siblings in my family.  But I take it day by day and 1 step at a time. With that being said it is beneficial to seek help. I  have done that with my daughter and it gives her multiple outlets and multiple people she can turn to for help.,1
"I'm sorry this is so long... But I Just posted this yesterday as a wake up call to my husband ...
I have a rant.....For those of you who have a friend or loved one with a mental illness/chemical imbalance let me share with you some thoughts. 

1. We have real genuine emotions...However. More often than not those emotions are overshadowed and pushed aside when the focus turns to the outburst we may have caused.....While trying to express our emotions. 

2. The MOST HURTFUL, BELITTLING thing u can say to someone with depression/bipolar or any other chemical imbalance disorder....Is.."" your not really mad/hurt/etc...Your just crazy, you'll be fine in a few days, you'll get over it""
(Most of us are well aware we let our crazy show way too much...We really don't need you to remind us)

Now that being said....Is it fair to you...That you deal with these outbursts and mixed emotions from your friend or loved one...NO...ITS NOT....I have no doubt that it's HARD...And painful.

I have personally put my own family and friends thru hell and back. And I would take it all back if I could...I would fix it every wrong or bad, impulsive decision I've ever made just to give them some peace.  Every day people like me struggle over EVERY​ single decision we make....Second guessing  if we are doing right thing or ""just being crazy"". (Once again....We are aware...Don't remind us). On good days....We are even able to evaluate the words that come out of our mouths or what is expressed on FB.

The point is...We do have real feelings...Real emotions....We get our feelings hurt...We get angry...Even when we are fully medicated....By not validating that....All your doing is pushing us away...Making us doubt ourselves more...In my world personally....I can't handle much more of that...My mind already runs 24/7 just trying to maintain a certain level of normalcy.",1
"It's a real struggle. I have good days and then there's those days that seem to never end. I also suffer from severe anxiety so when I'm low I'm very low but horribly  anxious at the same time. I want to crawl out of my own skin sometimes. On good days they're awesome and i feel somewhat ok. My medication is helping but as we all know there's no cure and medication can only HELP maintain the illness. When I'm down and depressed i think of the good days and try my best to stay positive by reminding myself that this won't last forever. Take your medication it does help, i know not all meds are for everyone and the process of finding the cocktail that work is agonizing because you're already on edge and aren't sure how the medication will work and react to your body. It's a process but it helps. Hang in there guys i truly mean it when i say i understand. We are not victims, we are not crazy, we are people who with patience and practice can heal and feel better.",1
"A constant struggle with myself
No meds anymore.
I'm getting by , by the grace of God.",1
"Recently I met a woman I really liked, adored, felt compassion for and respected, and the other day she hurt me badly and let me go from my job, even by lying to do it. I was so hurt for this person was one in a million to me. I didn't take her for granted, I didn't obsess over her but she was integral in my choice to work there and my happiness there. I think we bipolar pick up on certain qualities and characteristics but overlook the reality of how that person can be in the given environment. And what we get is not all there is to see. We need to be careful.",1
"Yes.
When I met my last girlfriend, I felt obsessed about her. 
She's since left me.
I still think about her every day, and it kills me.",1
Or whether it will be a debilitating depressive episode or an extreme anxiety episode.,1
"Someone offended me at work when I was able to keep a job, at 10 a.m in the morning. I was in a manic episode till 2 a.m the following morning. Shaking with pure (irrational) hatred.",1
"It is more noble to live with your own agony than to transfer it to those that you love. It is horrible to say, but I am used to the agony I live with everyday, so I am better resourced to cope with it due to sheer experience with my own emotion. To end my life would take my agony and force it into the lives of those I love, and that simply isn't something I am willing to do. I can deal with the constant questions whirling around in the dark vortex of despair in my brain, but if I were to stop that happening..? My mum, my girlfriend, my friends, my colleagues would all be thinking endless thoughts, ""why didn't we notice it sooner?"", ""why didn't he trust us enough to talk about how he felt?"", ""how could we have helped him?""... and that kind of rumination is something I wouldn't wish upon my very worst of enemies x",1
I survive by thinking every day is a different day I may wake up happy tomorrow live each day a day at a time and don't pressure yourself xxx,1
"Because instead of thinking of your pain, you need to think of what it would do to your family and friends. If you have kids, it changes them in ways you'll never see because you won't be there. However, we all know the struggle.",1
Name of companies: Anxiety Girls,1
"No, big emphatic no. There is no way, when I plunge to low that i could possibly follow this advice. Not a true representation of  how depression/anxiety/bipolar works. At all!!!!!!",1
Yes. I see a psychiatrist and counselor. But I still struggle.,1
"I know the feeling of cutting . I only do it  once in a while . I went rock bottom recently and took a razor down my arm deep and long . I had it stapled back together ,I ment it this time, I wanted to die . I have lived with anxiety, depression and resently been diagnosed with bi polar. These things are no fun let me tell you. The meds I take don't seem to work all the time. I wish you luck, happiness,and a long good life.",1
"Talking or texting or emailing your thoughts and feelings, like dairy keeping or indeed talking, are all good. find someone to talk to too. If you think people are scared to listen, as many are, because it is illness they can't see or often understand, tell them they are not as half as scared as you are to tell. I was so very fortunate, during my recent depressive episode,  to have people around me who listened and did no judge and offered comfort and joy. Principally my partner. The texts and FB messages and Messenger messages from people who were not nearest or dearest, but who experience of what I was experiencing and were able to tell  me because I told them first, was a delightfully supportive surprise. Ignore gender bias , but these may be useful      https://www.mentellhealth.org/      and Resource section of  https://mentellblog.wordpress.com/",1
I have a friend I speak with and my husband but he was at work and she asleep and it wasn't an extreme emergency so I didn't want to wake her.  And my other social media account was very dead so that is why I posted here and then got paranoid lol.  I am pretty open about my struggles so the more I thought on it the less paranoid I became. I am so sorry those around you do not show the support you deserve and need.  I'm lucky to have a pretty tight circle around me.,1
"Thats the whole thing, stuggling. But a hole nother  thing when it comes to struggling  alone!!!! I wish the stigma of having a mental illness would just disappear. What makes me the saddest is people serounding me (closets family ) telling me get over it, its your own fault your like this, and the best one.....its all in your head get a grip. Sometimes wish they could  walk in my shoes for 1 day, just 1 day......its utter hell! If they see this post so what, all that will be said is........ooooops there she goes again  ",1
"Most importantly, I was struggling and I needed to say that.  Past that, what will be will be.",1
"I am not overly worried as they know I have issues, I was a little worried about the cutting part as I'm not as open about my darkness as I am about my other crazy. If people read it so be it. I guess I am not as concerned now as I first was.  Thank you again   ",1
"Well I figure you should know it's a possibility. Next time tell them you want it to be anonymous when they share a post of yours. 
It's not really paranoia when it comes to social media. It's a digital age and anything can be found if you dig hard enough or spend enough time looking. Just being honest. If you're worried,message the page and ask them to take the post down.",1
"Thank you much, I get paranoid easily and that helped immensely.",1
"I always acted happy and carefree.  But when I was diagnosed and went for therapy a whole lot of things fell into place. A lot of things in my past just made sense. I wish I had help when I was young. But my mom who suffers of severe depression was to busy to notice. I had a total burn out 7 years ago but my loving husband and son has been my rock.  But my doctors are amazing as well. I have been with the same psychiatrist and Psycologist all this time and they pull me through many times. It took a while to get my meds right but it is fine now. I still have manic episodes and have learned that it is okay to ask for help, even if it is just a hug.  If family don't understand it is usually because they are scared that you will blame them.  Get help go to good doctors and then sit and explain what you feel and go through. I took my hubby to counselling with me a few times and it helped. If you feel alone just check the page there is always someone with loving help and advise",1
You are not alone being diagnosed is the first step. Dont be afraid to share your true feelings. Put you first take care of you. There is a huge support system out there. Good Luck  ,1
I went through the same thing since I was 16 I did research cause I knew the way I thought and the way I acted didn't feel normal to me as I saw everyone around how they were I got diagnosed 2 years ago and I was right that I was bipolar..it's a scary thing...through that time my mother would tell me you're not bipolar just cause you look at stuff on the Internet and when I got upset she always threatened to put me in the hospital and always called me manic. Now ever since I was diagnosed she asked questions 1 time and never talked about it since so I feel you...go talk to you're doctor cause if you feel it you might be,1
"I would go intricate here but in a nutshell... (but feel free to ask or direct messages me) 

If a particular batch of people wasn't tampering with the reality and offsetting of polarisation in the world and people, Which is accompanied by severe Sociopaths and NarcoPaths, the poles of energies that make us up wouldn't be confused.. Nor would would be in a orchestrated narcissistic world!! 
Alone and isolated one must find solitude and within oneself, serendipity and contentment even if no ones innerstands you.. 

I found several major puzzle piece's to what is going on and the deeper mechanics that unveil and expand and repair our consciousness mind and body somewhat... 

Anywhoo, Wholeness ♾

"I say that I am not a proffessional. but just gotta let that anxiety out. go to a place or do it in your house in your room and take a deep breathe and then let it out as a big loud scream. that will hopefully help you feel a little bit better.  then you have got to be strong and bring yourself to looking for friends that are willing to listen and respond to your questions. I know this will be hard but it would be good to find a therapist that will actually listen to you and give you her proffesional out put.

I hold my breath when anxiety attacks...Ughhh.,1
Tricia LeAnne Cordell because my anxiety bothers you :) I like this article!,1
Very true with people that have depression/anxiety.,1
According to my husband depression and anxiety are things people allow themselves to have. And they should just not allow themselves to get that way. It is just a cop out to get out of things,1
"Ca n relate big time 

  panic station everyone get to your panic stations   ",1
It's strange how all my anxiety just disappears when I go high (I have bipolar btw if anybody reads this and thinks I'm on illicit drugs!!!).,1
Hey. My partner is like you. He has bipolar as well as depression and anxiety.  He often in his lows gets drunk for long periods of time and says he doesn't want to be together and the next day says he loves me then says doesn't want to be together etc. what should I believe. That he loves me or that he doesn't want the relationship,1
i thought i have outgrown my anxiety but i guess i was wrong,1
"A lot of these are on point.  I relate the most to replaying conversations, wondering if I did something wrong when someone doesn't respond right away, beating myself up constantly, and fear of mistakes.  
My anxiety, in my opinion, is the one thing out of 2 things I've been diagnosed with that I just cannot get a handle on at all.  Therapy has helped my depression and self harming with added meds, but I just can't get the thoughts of being a massive failure and screw up to stop.  That and the suicidal ideation.  Constant thoughts of ""everyone would be better without me"" and ""I'm replaceable.""",1
i get how u both feel because i do as well people with anxiety rly need people around them that try to help them because i have felt the same way about everyone would be better off without me from time to time and its hard because if you honestly dont have it you dont understand how it makes us feel they only think they know,1
We should.   I feel very alone in this process of trying to get better most of the time. I can't seem to find many that understand and can't shake the stigma associated with depression mostly.,1
I could have just written that. Scary. I feel the EXACT same thing. We should talk.,1

"Therapy helps, sometimes you may go through a few therapists til you find the right fit  for you.  I only take 20mg of lamictal and 10mg of Nortriptyline which I'm prescribed for a nerve in my face but it also works for depression, which I have severely. Right now it is at bay which I'm greatful for. If you believe in God, you can talk to him, that has helped me alot, but everyone is different. I have social anxiety but not taking anything for it right now",1
"Along with meds, I suggest adding some vitamins and minerals. I struggled with severe depression for years and feel like vitamin B 12 saved my life. It can be found it in a pill form or you can have your vitamin levels checked and get injections. Some people like me don't absorb B12 correctly, so injections are the only method that works for me. I also recently started taking magnesium tablets which have greatly reduced my anxiety. I hope things get better for you very soon   ",1
let her know that there are several people in this world who care for their loved ones ... she/ he just needs to open up about herself to them and i m pretty much sure that they will be patient listenre and they will listen to watever that person has to say.. and i say so because a month ago i had met someone with same thing i wont say it as a disorder because it seems like a disease but i feel it is not so .everyone has flaws and no one is perfect and their is someoe to accept u in that way ... i m someone who is filled with completely trust issues and i dont trust even myself but i m trying to change just because of that one person who came in my life as achange i wanted to be around with her everytime but i lost her cause she found someone else ... and the only reason i lost her was because someone else was a better listener and compassionate towards her if u r having this anxiety depression then let me tell u accept it as a fact and wear it like an armour so that no one in this world could hurt u again and agin by saying that u have a disease... its a rare thing to have ... i have only came across one person and she is almost as close to me as like my mother ... but i believe she is unique as she makes people feel special and so i believe u r asweel ... people are there to care for u and talk to ... its 2 o clock in the night and i m still awake i havent slept in last 4 days ... and it always happens to me that i suffer from insomnia after every fortnight .. i have lost my lullaby ..so if u have someone who loves u and cares for u then just dont loose them and talk to them cause u cant bear the pain of loosing the only lullaby.,1
"Your meds may need to be adjusted. I am treated for bipolar with anxiety at one polarity and depression at the other. I take two kinds of mood stabilizers, one an atypical Zonisamide that emphasizes anxiety at night,400mg, standard dose, then lithium 300mg slow release 3X a day, then atypical ziprasidone at night for sleep. I have a benzo as needed for anxiety at nighttime. This combination works well for me.",1
"I have had depression and anxiety from about 12years old.although  my depression has never been too severe at times it has defined me. Now i try to be in charge of it and quite a lot of the days kit works you can still have bad days,just try to go with it as tomorrow really is another day. You will get there seek all the help you can get from your g.p. and psychological therapies. You will get to a better place. All the best.",1
"You definitely need some different meds and some stronger doses to stop the monkey gym that's going on inside your head driving you to chaos. The noise in your head needs to be turned way down and medicine can do that. I suggest slow release lithium and an atypical anti psychotic like ziprasidone. Another great mood stabilizer is Zonisamide which has an active element for anxiety. Zoloft taken in the morning at a low dose with this combination is like a good sprinkle of salt for depression, too much and it can cause depression or mania but 25mg is good. Finally counseling!",1
"If things don't get better, look at the meds I'm now on. I use to take effexor but ultimately it did not work for me. I would really like to to see you try a mood stabilizer, and lithium is the best although the name sounds harsh I know. It's been such a great for me dealing with depression and anxiety. Good luck honey!",1
"Thank you! The meds were just adjusted I take Effexor rx 225mg, clomipramine 50mg, I also have Klonapin and hydroxozine for anxiety and panic attacks. And I am seeing a new therapist tomorrow will he my third visit.",1
"Thanks for sharing our story!! Everyone please feel free to share our story, this was avoidable for our daughter. Our daughter is 12 and has been stable we begged and pleaded with our property management to do the right thing and to take our daughters mental health into consideration.

"Only been on it for 2mths but no probs with sweating. Is shaking as in hands, legs or head an issue for anyone. As this has been a huge problem for me at the moment.",1
When my hands get sweaty it's the first sign along with shaking of a panic attack. But this started way before I started Effexor. I haven't noticed any worse sweating after starting it,1
There is so much help out there so by taking the first step and  asking for it  you have started on a journey of hope. From personal experience I know Its not a short journey but the doctors/ psychiatrists know how to help you so dont feel anxious about meeting them. You don't  have to deal with this alone so all the best.,1
"I agree that you need to see a psychiatrist and try medications. I suggest adding some vitamins and minerals as well.

"Panic disorder is on the DSM and needs immediate treatment as does self harm. Feelings of suicide are very serious, and you need to find and emergency room psych ward right away and tell them you're a harm to yourself and check yourself in and they will refer you later to a proper psychiatrist. Right now you need a higher level of care. Go get it dear!",1
You need to see a dr to get referred to a psychiatrist and therapist. You can't deal with this all on your own. Look up mindfulness. It is great for dealing with anxiety although you will probably have trouble doing it yourself to start with but it might be worth checking if out while you wait to see your specialist.,1
Hi suffered 2 years with the exact same thing the dr told me I had GAD it's takes time . I didn't take any meds I was to scared . Time healed me,1
I just went through this my mania was so high it was causing anxiety attacks luckily new dr recognized this put me on seroquel it's been a godsend,1
"I find if you have a panic attack it normally happens when you start focusing on yourself, the fear.... If you have a fidget toy, play a game in your phone and shift your focus I find it not as bad. As for the rest finding balance with your doctors, needs and therapy is definitely.",1
"First thing, I'm so sorry you have to go though this. Try going to a different dr, one for mental anxiety and depression. Or try councilling.(or both) You need help in dealing with this. With the right help you can learn some skills to cope with this!!!! Your reaching out is a good thing and a good sign that you want help.just know you are loved and there is people on your side.good luck to you, and let us know how things are working out. It will be all right  ❤",1

If I don't talk to anyone I will cry and it won't stop.

Why do you keep posting these?! Support page? Turning into a shame page tbh!!,1

This is a pretty blamey/shamey sort of meme.",1
"You just literally posted this on a page devoted to illnesses that sometimes take away from (or at least inhibit) the sufferer's ability to choose this. 

Can we get some things on this page that are actually helpful and informative?",1

"Welcome to the club.  It is really hard when our loved ones are severely mentally ill.  We feel like we are getting ill too because of the stress of it.  I have a hard time with communication when my loved one is getting more ill also.  There is a lot you can read online and there are some good books written also.  It was hard for me to learn not to challenge delusions.  It is hard to realize that they are ill and to not take their anger personally.  When I was a child, we had to get my Mother to the hospital, but we always put it off as long as possible, hoping unrealistically that she would get some sleep and feel better.  My mother would get manic.  After she was in the hospital for a while she would say, "" Why didn't you get me here sooner?""  But when she was so sick she did not want to go.  Hang on to the fact that she will be feeling better soon, although it may be a while.  These days they are required to go to groups in the hospital and they do get to think about mental health and how to stay healthy mentally.  You can go to a support group held by Nami for families.  That may help you.",1
"First of all- you are AMAZING - you did the best u could at the time. And her health was your main concern/priority. That's love - period. Nobody likes inpatient care. Especially mental health. But she needed you and you showed up and stepped up. Don't doubt yourself on that decision. I'm so sorry she is suffering and you are feeling helpless. Find a good counselor for YOU. Similar to AA, people who love those with mental illness need support too- and that'll help U to feel more confident about caring for her. Bipolar is a bitch. Excuse the language but it's seriously horrid. Be there for hugs. Hold her when she's panicking and help her breathe slower while u hold her. Remind her that its ok to stay in bed or ""check out"" when overwhelmed. She's blessed to have u.",1
Good that you are supporting her. ...but before that please. ...please try to find out the reason why it all started. ...what's all is going in back of her mind which is troubling her. ...she might be hesitant to share it easily. ....but u have to find out that. ....rather going for medications. ....I know it is necessary  ...but try to figure out the reasons first  ....as no one is born with this illness. ....,1
"Give her space and love, keeping a watchful eye on her. Do the things you would do, yard work,handling the vehicles. Throw in ""I love you"" a few times but not constantly. One of them will get in. Ask her if she wants to go out, if only for a walk, dont get mad when and if she doesn't. We dont want pressured of made to feel evil and ignorant. I lost my daughter's dad that way. He hovered so much I could not keep a thought if I tried. Bipolar we have enough going on I our heads to deal with than to be made a monster    good luck truly",1
"I want to start by telling you I appreciate you wanting to understand better. I have lived with it for over 30 years forcing my husband to "" live with it also"" like you he educated himself. The thing I want to tell you most is we are uncurable. We are not crazy it's not all in our heads and how can we make some one else understand what we don't. For me it was finding the right set of medication ( this took years) continual therapy Because the meds only help "" manage"" the symptoms. And even with all this help I still have episodes. My husband knows he can't fix it, but he has learned to communicate with me and when not to. Sometimes we want to be held. Sometimes we want to be left alone. Sometimes when we lose control we need someone to intervene. You did the right thing. I am betting when your wife slips into a sane moment she will agree. It's not that we want to die its that we just want these OVERWHELMING feelings to stop. Read research literature because the better you understand the better her support team to a manageable life.",1
"First off, She is very lucky to have someone who is so supportive, so give yourself credit for that!  I have bipolar and depression, and on my bad days some times my spouse has difficulty handling it, or knowing the right things to do, so I understand (from how he has explained it) how you are feeling.
I can't speak for everyone as everyone is different but for me the whole pushing everyone away is somethibg that happens to me a lot, especially during episodes.  I don't want anyone near me, I have trouble feeling connected to anything or anyone, including my spouse.  For me, what means a lot to me is that he is supportive as well, and doesn't give up on me even when I want him to.  Sometimes even if I want to reach out and talk, I can't bring myself to do it, so I shut everyone out instead. When I'm in that state of mind, I'm certain that I am a burden to everyone, and that everyone will give up on me.  Reassurance is something I need, a lot.  I would say just make sure that she knows that you are there with her. That she s not alone, and that you love her, and that you will be there beside her while she gets through this.  She may try to push you away and i would imagine it's not an easy thing to feel, but don't take it to heart. It's her illness talking, not her.  Sometimes the illnesses can take control of us. I can think of countless times when I am pushing my spouse away, or being mean so he will go away, but on the inside I want nothing more than to be with him but I can't bring myself to say those words or to drop that wall that I have up.  Being stuck inside yourself is scary.  
You are doing the right thing by being there for her, and she will come out of this! ❤",1
"Her saying she hates you or the anger that's not her speaking that's the illness. It may not seem like it now but things will get better. She's very lucky to have your support and you trying to understand what she's going through. 

I must say you are awesome and you should be so proud of yourself for taking these steps. Like some of the others have said just don't forget to take care of yourself as well, you can't be there for orders if you are tired, rundown or overwhelmed.",1
You have done the right thing and she will understand in time when she is on the correct meds. Bless you and your family it's a battle but stick together and you will cope xx above all talk to anyone you can and don't be afraid of taking help and advise much love to you xx,1
I have bipolar and depression and anxiety and ptsd its one hell of a roller coaster even with meds I feel like im in a nightmare be there for her let her know shes not alone and that she is loved good luck to u sir I hope things get better,1
I hate panic attack,1
Scary.  Very....all above,1
I think it is hard for others to understand what it really feels like. They also are very unsure about what they can do. I have been anxious and have had panicky feelings for several days now and I am not sure what helps. I breathe count look around the room use mindfulness but it is still present and disturbing. If someone else is with me it helps be present with person is very important validating that it must be difficult is also important.,1
"What helps? - Being in a safe place, feeling loved, having family or friends who want nothing, aren't telling you what to do and cause no stress. :)",1

Wow! I've had this problem for years! Just didn't realise it was an actual symptom. Seriously didn't know. It was so bad, I could eat in front of family, really struggled. Hated eating out, still do.

Because it helps most if not all my symptoms from bipolar and ADHD and as more and more data and research surfaces it's showing to be a lot safer and much less side effects then pretty much anything from the pharmacy. I still take lithium and adderall but smoking keeps me happy and functioning. The psycho active properties stimulate my brain during depressivecycles but it also keeps me pretty calm and clear headed when I get manic. If I'm having a panic attack/break hitting a bowl will either pull me completely out of it or bring me down enough that my other coping mechanisms can now be used effectively. As for the ADHD it really controls the impulsive thoughts and let's me get really into a paper I'm writing or a song I'm learning on piano rather then constantly needing new stimuli and moving on after 5 minutes,1

"Nothing is bad, everything is manageable sweetie. You need a med that kills two birds with one stone preferably and the best and proven on the market is lithium. It's a mood stabilizer.

"Hi Alisha, Sorry you have been feeling depressed. How long has this been going on for you and have you been prescribed any medication? The symptoms of depression can be managed but you may benefit from some counselling to talk through the cause and to help you explore some coping mechanisms for your social anxiety.

"Hi Vanessa, It's not something I've experienced myself.

I often think about killing myself. Somedays I think about how hard it would be on certain people then other days (the ones that are really scary mentally) are the days when I think it would be so easy right now. Like it wouldn't bother me at all. Almost like I want to mess with death. It sounds really stupid but I'm trying to be honest. I admire all of the tattoos. Love to you all.,1
"Some great advice here. There are times in life that we can cope with our anxiety because we strategically avoid situations that trigger said anxiety. You have obviously reached a point where this is now not working for you. Please take the advice given so far and visit a psychiatrist for some help, your doctor should be able to refer you or make a recommendation. ~VW~",1
"A good Psyc dr can help as well as a tharapist, I would find some right away, it's hard to treat anxiety , I'm on 6 meds for bipolar one but my anxiety is really bad      ",1
When anxiety goes untreated and gets worse the next stage is paranoia. You seem to be exhibiting some signs. Get into a psychiatrist quickly and get treatment honey.,1
"I was very much the same I thought I was getting better but I avoided things, maintained a very very strict control on myself and when things got so overwhelming I just about lost it... I got so depressed, I couldnt control mood swings. I realized I had no quality of life and I needed help and no was going to do that but me. I keep looking till I found a Dr I liked and listened to me, that understood it wasn't am about the meds and let me try alternatives until I realized they really weren't helping and when I was ready I started on meds. It's taken awhile to find some that work but I'm getting better. Having someone to talk to like a psychiatrist that again you really like and can eventually open up to really helped me. 

Having the right team and positive things to focus on even when things get bad makes a world of difference.",1
I agree time to go to a doctor. I would also suggest it's time to see a therapist as they will be able to teach you the skills and techniques you need to manage your anxiety and depression as medication alone will not cure you.,1
"Time to go to the doctor, this is long overdue. I suspect part of your anxiety is the isolation as well, anxiety depression is a very isolating place to be. You must phone the doctor today and try and get an appointment today in my opinion I would regard your appointment is an emergency. Make sure you do it it will lift the weight off your shoulders.   ",1
With depression and anxiety I relate to this.,1
I don't feel these things. Life since a very young girl has always been a constant struggle for me in some form or another. I've never been in the normal range but could mix with them. The job part can be the most trying due to my meds giving me some bad days but I don't regret ME. How could I?,1
I take lexapro for my depression/anxiety. Only side effects I have are the bad days when I forget to take it.,1
"Yes, I'm currently taking for bipolar, mixed. I was previously taking it as a heart medication. Was hospitalized for bipolar and then restarted on propranolol. I believe it helps with the anxiety that physically manifests into an abnormal heart arrhythmia. One can be connected to the other.",1
I take 40 mg every morning. I'm definitely handling stressful situations a little better.,1
"I've taken it for years def helps me ,I can't manage my anxiety without it   ",1
I took it for high blood pressure. It made me sweat profusely. I would sweat just sitting. I finally told my doctor I didn't want to take it anymore.,1
"It seems to be helping my anxiety to the point of I'm even sleeping better. Racing thoughts are even slowed down. Not 100% all the time, but definitely seeing a difference.",1
Does dampen down my physical symptoms of anxiety especially rapid and pounding heart,1
I took it but only for the shakes I got from my anxiety. It didn't do anything other than stop my tremors.,1
This is the truest statement ! People think depression is a joke or something that a bowl of ice cream can cheer you up. It's not. I've dealt with depression my entire life. When my dad died it was horrible & now I lost my childhood home & I just want to die. I want to throw in the towel & quit. Depression is so hard to deal with     ,1
"Omy yes I can't hold my arms over my head or up at all for too long   I had to buy a wig not only due to hair loss,related to stress,but because I just can't do my hair any longer    Without feeling so dizzy I'll pass out   I just don't even bother anymore",1
You need to see your doctor. I get like that when I have too much lithium in my blood which can be dangerous or just by taking some antipsychotics. The head shaking also combined with an uncontrollable jaw. I've found a balance of lithium and my antipsychotic olanzapine so I don't get it much any more. It's something that you shouldn't have to put up with. I'm not saying that's what you have just my experience. I hope it helps,1
"While you love your boyfriend he is overwhelmed because of his childhood issues, his parents and their attitude to you, his finances, and fatherhood, and he's young. I really think your emotions are best taken care of by an expert who can properly help you anyway. This is important for your son that you get the help you need sweetie.",1
"I think the relationship sounds like it could be good for the both of you. As life is hard on all of us he might himself have mental health issues. If nothing else it sounds as if his mom and stepdad are making it very hard on him to make his own decision and if you add that same pressure on him he might be in a type of stasis where he would rather not decide one way or another. Although he should be more helpful when you are upset who knows what he might be feeling or thinking at that moment. It is up to you to decide if that kind of treatment is acceptable in your life and you alone.

If you love something let it go. If it comes back then it was meant to be. 

As for what you can do for you is focus on you and your son. Don't allow anyone to discount your emotions about the fire. That kind of event is very tough and you never get over them but you can get to a point where you are at ease with the memory. I try to think different about those situations like...""I made it out and got me and my child to safety. Obviously I can handle my shit! I'm awesome and strong!""
Therapy is good for situations like this. You get a different view on the things going on in your life. You also have a safe place to vent and can get more out than what you just shared with us. 

Just remember that many here care enough to try and give you something to go on. Some kind of advice that hopefully will help and ease your pain. Even though its facebook and you can't feel our hands on your back to console you in your time of need we all do care about you and very much.",1
"Yes I agree he is incapable of being a good support to you. You need to go to the doctors immediately and get on bipolar/depression/anxiety medicine. You also need to be strong for your son and do yourself a huge favor-quit seeing your sons father immediately. When you have been on your medication for 6-8 weeks and can make a sound decision talk to him about seeing your son. You and your sons well being should always come first. Trust me when I say that your son sees the stress you carry and could have a negative effect on him. It happened to me with my daughter until I straightened myself out. If you do need a shoulder please inbox me. I will not judge you but I will not lie to appease to either. I'm a straight shooter. I have everything you have and I have dealt with it my entire life. 
I am not a doctor so I won't give you medical advice except make a Drs appt. asap

It is so hard to make yourself not.  Feel guilty  but to help others you must take care of yourself,1
"I also have Bipolar and ADHD I take Ritilan, lithium and serequol... by 3-4pm I'm the same upset & angry.. Ive been thinking its the ritilan but without it I have zero focus, memory & concentration. Tried taking an extra dose of ritilan at 3pm but then my mind wont shut off at bed time.. and disturbed sleep makes me manic.. its all a vicious cycle   ",1
"I'm bipolar 1 but also diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, OCD, and ADHD. I have yet to find anything that works for me. Adderall helped my ADHD by allowing me to better focus but gave me the jitters triggering anxiety issues. I'm so over it! There are so many different medications out there but finding the right one is never-ending. Especially, for those of us that suffer from more than on disorder because then its about never-ending combinations.    exhausted",1
"Hello. I have the same diagnosis as you. I like vyvanse from morning until about 5pm and then  I get shaky and a bit agitated. I have to take 2mg of Lorazapem, which is a benzodiazapines. It immediately takes the edge off. For my bipolar I take lithium slow release capsules 300mg 3X a day and 400mg zonisamide at night which is a mood stabilizer with an edge for anxiety. I hope this helps you. Good luck!",1
"Anxiety meditation d, counselling/ therapy and hypnotherapy is susceptible to it. Medication IF that helps but no substitute for good psychiatric - NOT GP - assessment. CBT from a counsellor/therapist might help too.",1
"He needs a psychiatrist and a counsellor too but more importantly he needs himself to be less worried about his illness ,he is not alone there are many like him things gets ok soon or later and if he has you by his side that,s enough to get the hell out of this shit",1
"I have severe anxiety panic disorder. Extreme anxiety. To the point I can't eat everyday and I will not step outside. The lightest foundation is too dark for me.  Lol.... Haven't left the home in 1 year. Severe depression, severe anxiety......im slowly working on it with my doctor. In a bad way atm but hopefully it will ease.  I hope the same for your bf. It's horrendous to live with. Absolute nightmare",1
"For several months l have battled the onslaught of complex post tramatic stress disorder (comlpex as trauma has been a reoccurring theme throughout my life.

"I got hit by a car and got ptsd and anxiety as a result.... It's hard going out some days but I stick to a routine and it makes it easier to out certain places. I push myself occasionally as long as I have my phone to tell me where to go, play games etc the main thing about going out is keep their mind off of the things that create the anxiety. 

And of course if the needs aren't working, back to the drawing board and try again. Talk therapy works great as well...",1
My agoraphobia is similar to your husband's fear level. I take Effexor and Rexulti. They help me stay present and unafraid most of the time. Your husband should absolutely talk to a psychiatrist about Panic Disorder and any signs of PTSD or C-PTSD,1
Please dont smoke weed your paranoia would go through the roof xx this is from someone who knows,1
It depends on the weed I think. I have social anxiety and a severe anxiety disorder and I notice when I've smoked it. My anxiety has gone down,1
"He needs to see both a psychiatrist and a therapist. He should be doing cognitive behavioral therapy with the therapist. The most likely drug that would help him is Effexor, which treats both depression and anxiety.",1
I'm not a doctor but I'm treated directly for maintenance high-level ⚡anxiety. I take lithium and zonisamide and lorazepam which is a benzo. Please get him to a proper psychiatrist! Anxiety is horrible.,1
"I lived in my bedroom for three years because of anxiety.  For almost a year now I've been taking vybrid,  Xanax,  and 5htp. It has been working so well I actually volunteer three days a week now.  I only use the Xanax in worse case scenarios.  I still primarily hang out in my bedroom,  but little steps go a long way!  Good luck.",1

I'm sorry to hear what you are both going through. I take Sertraline and Venlafaxine to combat my illness and on whole they work but I do get periods of darkness. As someone who has battled depression and anxiety for over 25 years I have started to try and occupy my mind. Does he have anything that he enjoys doing? I have found photography a good outlet and also music. I'm terrible but I've started to teach myself the guitar. It helps me. I wish you all the best ☺,1

"How I've been feeling but I know I'm going through it all to make me stronger, my heart had melted again for a while so far m afraid of going back to the ice maiden again but I can't control that if it does guess that's just another part of me dying!",1
"I have a Daughter, 2 Granddaughters, 1 ADHD Grandson, 5 Nieces  we are all Bipolar. It's so very hard to live a life of Bipolar illness No one understands what you go through each day, as a Bipolar person I do not know what to expect from myself each day I wake up. I hide my feelings most of the time so no one worried about me, I'd go to take a shower so I could hide my feelings so many other things I do! If everyone could just try to understand who I really am! No matter how much I'm loved  I feel unloved most of the time!",1
I don't know what I think of that. We all want desperately to be understood.,1
I have anxiety and depression and my diagnosis is bipolar largely because of these two polarities. If you are acting 180 degrees out of character you can suspect manic behavior.,1
"It could be a hormone imbalance but it could just as easily be that the frustration has been building up and it's reaching it's peak. Mental illness aside, you are only human and it's natural to get frustrated when things are stressful. I don't think it's unreasonable to speak out when all you needed in the first place das a straight answer. Make sure you unwind outside of work and visit your doctor for some blood tests to check your levels. ~VW~",1

I've been diagnosed as bipolar for 23 years but was bipolar with no diagnosis for years before that. I have felt hopeless so many times even to say a daily struggle with feelings of hopelessness,1
Hopeless sounds like low energy and at minimum mild depression. By now you may have self confidence and self esteem issues as well. And thus some social anxiety. Are you in counseling? Are you in a BP support group? Do you get a little exercise? Have you considered a pet? Have you evaluated your meds with your doctor because it's not normal for you to be suffering.,1
"I've had it for 17 years. Everyday is a struggle but I have found with therapy, the right meds and spousal support it is possible to make it. The older I get the worse it gets I just chose to handle it differently.",1
I was diagnosed last year and its a struggle :(,1
"There is strong evidence to support bipolar runs in families, this true in mine, without getting personal as some members are still alive, but a very close relative has just been diagnosed. Get the help now even if your fears are unfounded, good luck.",1
As a person who fights suicidal ideations every day and as a person who's attempted suicide quite a number of times throughout my life this post was in a very strange way reassuring you get tired of hearing how other people will feel nobody seems to care how you feel no one understands the deep hole of despair that's suicidal person is in no one understands the bone-chilling pain that a suicidal person is always in and how every day is a struggle not to try to kill yourself,1
"It's not the main reason, it's just a reason that is a lot easier to hold onto and believe. Suicidal people don't care about themselves anymore, but more often than not they still care deeply about their family. It could be why they bottled up all their feelings and let it get to that point, because they didn't want to worry anyone. Oh, and this is someone's LIFE we're talking about. If guilt tripping keeps someone alive until they can find a better reason to stay alive, that's a success in my book.",1
This is true. I currently am one. Whenever someone says it it makes me feel guilty and a lot worse. We all know they would miss you but what ppl think when their suicidal is I have no life. That's what's important to focus on and this says just that.,1
"Such a simple acknowledgement but so true. You shouldn't  be afraid to do things in life that benefit you first, instead of others. People  need to make themselves first, which the mentality of the suicidal person is that everyone is above them. That needs to go!",1
"Okay, but.  The only reason I'm alive today is because I realized how my death would affect others.  It took me YEARS to reach a place where I felt like I deserved to live for my own sake.  Sometimes in a crisis, you do what it takes to stay alive.  Yes, it's just a temporary fix... but so is putting pressure on a bleeding wound.  If it keeps you alive until you can reach a more permanent solution, it's valid.",1
Guilt trips make you feel like more of a worthless loser. Calling me selfish doesn't help.,1
"When you're suicidal you're in the tunnel and it's black. There's no light at the end of the tunnel. And it hurts and it's disorienting and scary and you can even hyperventilate to the point at which you become calm because you begin to think you'll kill yourself and start developing a plan. I think the key is faith, and not necessarily in god, just faith that just as there's darkness, naturally there WILL be lightness very soon, and you can withstand this pain that will definitely release you when the light in the tunnel enters, and it will. At this point you will breathe better, think more clearly and positively, and walk away from the black spell. You will have missed a bullet and get on with the rest of your day. Sometimes it really is just an analogy to help your head survive.",1
"I've never known a suicidal person that was thinking rationally. It's a deep, deep hole where self worth doesn't matter. And they've even come to the point that they think their families would be better off without them. I've felt it and I've seen it. I feel very confident in this belief. No, it's not a selfish act!  And that's a horrible thing to say. But, in those moments, the logic of understanding what the life of a survivor would forever be is a big deal. And caring about those other people is a lot easier to do than to care about ones self. They need support, understanding, and kindness. But this post sounds like an attention getting and not someone so tired with life that they are done.",1
"That's horrible!!!  I hate that we have to live with so much judgement. Even those that are trying to get attention NEED attention, need help, and they're in danger of things going too far. I hate it.",1
yes suicide does hurt loved ones.  It still will NEVER be the way to help a suicidal person to heap guilt on top of their self loathing to try and get them to stop feeling the anguish they are feeling.  Would you also tell someone with cancer that they can't die because their loved ones would be hurt?  Depression is an illness just like any other.  #endthestigma and stop trying to tell depressed people their disease is less important than other people's,1
that is the only reason i have not killed myself because of guilt i feel as if it would be too selfish,1
"Yeah it boils down to approach. There's is encouragment and there's guilt tripping. Support, not judgement. Being encouraged to think of your loved ones is not the same as being accused of being selfish for supposedly not considering them. Some people mean well, others are just assholes.",1
But there is a difference between you thinking about your family and making the decision to hold on and somebody else throwing guilt at you and calling you selfish for needing your pain to end.  Trying to guilt people into not suffering from a mental illness is just as ludicrous as trying to guilt a cancer patient for being sick,1
"Yeah,you know you are getting realngood at hiding when you can hide an anxiety  attack not the big ones but some of the otherd",1
As far as I know there are pregnancy safe meds to take but very very few. I'm almost 8 months pregnant been on zoloft the whole time and I have 3 different types of doctors all telling me zoloft is safe. Some meds are class c and the doctor has to decide if the benefit outweighs the risk. They may decrease your dosage or take you off completely and give you something considered safe. Most of the time staying on your meds while pregnant is better for you and the baby. You staying stable is what's best for the baby. They will watch you closely. Talk to your doctor about zoloft it's worked well for me tho yes everyone reacts different. It's helped keep me stable with my bipolar depression and anxiety.,1
"Being that I doubt you've been pregnant, or have a medical degree, I don't think your feedback is applicable to the question.",1
Paul David has written books that help with Anxiety they are really helpfully CBT is really good too I wish you well ☺,1
"He needs to see a therapist for some CBT. If they can do it via FaceTime or Skype, it would be great to get that in. Then, pinpoint what started the anxiety. Did he have an attack one day and then fearful of it ever since to the point that it's now become so disabling? Is he a veteran? PTSD? Seems that it's the negative self talk and thoughts that are getting to him right now by not being able to go out. I take Prozac, buspar and xanax, when needed. I know you said buspar didn't work, but how about Trazadone? Therapy is honestly going to help him in conjunction with the meds.",1
it sucks. i have a social anxiety where ill be okay for awhile like in a mall then all of a sudden get very overwhelmed.,1
Ask to try proprananol it's worked really well with my anxiety x,1
"Desiree Rivera  they're classed as beta blockers I'm prescribed up to 40mg per day in 10mg tablets to take as and when needed, they're what's usually prescribed for exam anxiety and driving lesson anxiety etc but are great for taking the edge off a situation like going out and busy places etc but he may benefit from an antidepressant at the same time, I see he's tried sertraline I didn't get on with that, have u tried citalopram? X",1
Very down in the dumps. Very scared of having an anxiety attack. He felt like a disappointment and embarrassed.,1
Taking any medicine while trying or during pregnancy should be avoided or minimised based on the risks of taking or not taking the  medication. As clonazepam is a benzodiazepine there is a risk that your baby will suffer withdrawal when born as drug will pass through your systems to babies. You and your Dr need to discuss pros and cons of stopping or continuing. I don't think clonazepam has specific risks to foetal development.,1
"I took all my medicine for bipolar/anxiety/ depression safely. My daughter is 14 and perfectly fine. I had blood work done every month to make sure my liver was doing well. I also had extra sonograms to ensure she was developing properly. I think if you have your ob/gyn and Physchiatrist work together throughout your pregnancy you should be able to take your meds throughout. 
On a side note - if you are stressed the baby will be stressed as well. Always weigh the pros VS the cons.",1
I took it all through out my pregnancy. The doctor said it was safe and it was important for me to be stable while I was pregnant than to risk an episode that could be dangerous. I now have an amazing healthy three year old son.,1
I was on Prozac for 3-4 months.. It was for stress induced seizures.. I had these side effects I took myself off and cleansed my system about a week and a half later I was ok...,1
"It took me three attempts to find something which worked: sertraline. The only downside was it gave me an upset stomach, but the first drug turned me into a zombie, the second made the anxiety worse. Like anything; some drugs work for some, some don't and side-effects may affect one person but not another. If it doesn't work for you, try something else. Also, most meds say not to just stop them but wean.",1
Typically there are side effects initially especially if you start on too high a dose but Prozac is proven for anxiety and depression. I wouldn't give up on it.,1
I have bipolar disorder.. depression... ocd and personality disorder.. I just want u 2 know I was diagnosed with depression when I had my daughter 8yrs ago.. I then went on to realise I had much more undiagnosed but was so afraid to tell my doctor the truth as the same as you was worried about the care of my daughter and to be judged as a bad parent.. many years went on and I met a new partner 4yrs ago and he picked up on it strait away.. I was in denial altho deep down I knew something was wrong.. it got to the point where I had to tell a doctor and in all honesty it was the best thing I ever done as they was so supportive and couldn't help me more.. my child is well looked after I told them as they do have to ask and the doctor and psychiatrist honestly take your word unless they have evidence to proof otherwise.. u need help and need to confined in a doctor before it gets too late...I don't have panic attacks anymore I don't have anxiety.. I sleep I do everything I should be doing .... but I do have 1 bad day out of say about 7 or 8 but it beats everyday life.. I'm so proud of getting the help and care I need for me and has helped my daughter 2... u reli should have a think about what is best for your children which means is best for you.. take care hun and get some help xxx,1
From the symptoms you described I would agree yoyare suffering g from depression. It's very common to have anxiety and panic attacks as symptoms of depression too. I can't comment on whether you are Bipolar but nothing you have described suggests you are. As for BPD medication doesn't really help talking therapy and CBT and again depression anxiety  can be co-occuring.  I would congratulate yourself for studying working and caring for your child that is so amazing and takes immense srtebgth. Perhaps go back to your GP. There are lots of antidepressants and spme are particularly good for combatting anxiety and panic attacks alongside depression. You are a star.,1
"Relax your mind, don't overwhelm your self and stick to a healthy diet.  When all else fails turn to Jesus to comfort and heal you !!",1
"Drowning means your body and especially your mind is overwhelmed and right now you can't cope with what's on your plate, which is A LOT. Your a mother, a wife, a cook, a cleaner, a student, a worker, a woman with multiple mental illnesses of which not all are getting the treatment they deserve so you can not cry for 3 hours straight and not want to work! Time to get honest because your borderline is active and maybe your bipolar causing panic attacks, it's a spiral that you need help to regulate and prevent in the future. Good luck honey, just be honest sweetheart.",1
"Start by telling your doctor about all of your symptoms. The right medication can go a long way towards getting you back on track. I have major depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD, insomnia, and chronic fatigue syndrome. I've been at rock bottom, including not being able to get out of bed to care for my family for days. My doctor wasn't interested in reporting me, only in helping me. And you need to be honest with your husband. He is your partner and your support system. Chances are he will be way more concerned about your well being than anything else.",1
"I have everything you listed above.. My SO was taking mirtrazipine for his insomnia but I took some once to see if they helped me. Long story short nothing helped me. Then again I only took one prescription or type of med at the same time. Was never on any sort of cocktail.. I know that for me the antipsychotics dulled me and the antidepressants just made me want to hurt myself even more.. The anti anxiety worked but only one type and they're so hard toget here. Anyway what ended up working for me was spending more time outside, meditation, yoga,, and spending time focusing on me.. Meditation helped a lot with the disordered thoughts and the psychosis. Other than that I would say you might benefit from finding a doc you trust and a therapist that will listen to you and help you try to navigate the pathways of your mind.. If you wanna chat my inbox is always open. Wishing you the best",1
"If you haven't got a visible illness most people don't have a clue how you feel and think they have the right to think you don't have a disabled illness. If you have a sudden panic attack/anxiety they can't see it and don't understand that you need to rush, sometimes passed them to get a taxi immediately to get home. But they think you are being rude. Think I need a tattoo on my forehead to let people know that I do have an illness. Xx",1
"Anyone who takes their own life must be in a horrible state. Unless you have been there you can't possibly imagine the pain these people are going through.

It's a real struggle for me these last few months,1
"So true. Every nite I pray I die in my sleep but in reality, all i really want is to b happy and for my family to b happy and love each otha. Sick of living and feeling this way.

My family and I just buried my husbands best friend today.  He suffered from depression and was in the middle of an extreme episode when he took his life.  I cannot imagine the pain he must've been feeling to push him to do what he did.  He had SO many people he could have gone to for help.  My husband is really struggling trying to understand why.,1
"I doubt it it is 'only' and always a flaw in chemistry, when all the circumstances are so bad all the doors you knock are locked by thousand locks, when you can't even trust the ground under your feet, when everyone is acting like you are a burden, when you can't have fun for very very long time, when you don't feel all the good feeling for such long time, there is nothing anchoring you to this world and reality, you start to fade away...in the hard circumstance of life, I guess being depressed is a normal reaction from our body and soul. there is nothing and nobody filling you up with positivity you try your best to go on by your energies, but how long it can last, really? 2 year, 5 year even, but not 10 years! after that there is this undeniable feeling of hopelessness that is normal for a year you almost forget it burying  in the deepest grounds, unaware of that it starts to grow and grow and one day you notice all your world is dark when you look up you see that little feeling of hopelessness that you thought you were got rid of by burying  it, had grown so big that casts its shadow all over your life! there is no escape but with a help from outside and a person who is really cares and what's to help, but I am sorry that everyone is so busy with their live or accusing you with different things...you must be so lucky to has someone that cares so deeply that will do anything for you to just see you smile...I hope all of you will have all the help you need, God bless you all with total mental and physical health.",1
"Depression is the darkest cloud you never want to face. It seeps into your bloodstream and takes ahold eventually of your spirit, like a parasite it globs on to you and doesn't let go until it's had it's way with you. The experience is scary, sometimes free-falling and bleak. What it can't take is all your mind and what you believe in and those are the threads by which I hang on. Everytime.",1

"Yenz Maelstrom 
Yes I've kept my job for 18 years, but it hasn't been without the odd major blip. The key for me was to religiously take my medication, behind all the craziness of my illness was a little bit of logic, I desperately wanted the same things as everybody else, to have as much of a normal life as possible. There are times where this is not possible because of the illness but I keep trying. Working for me it's a distraction from being unwell, it isn't easy but I keep at it. I have recently been treated for breast cancer and I am on the phased return to work at the moment after being off for five months. I think to myself what else can life throw at me, whatever life does throw at me I will fight it as hard as I can.         ",1

We are moving to another town 4 hours away. My wife and her friends are really struggling to say goodbye to each other. We're going to a second going away party tonight. We are also going out for dinner on Wednesday. We leave on Friday. They'll all be hugging and telling each other through tears how much they'll love and miss each other. I'll just stand there with a stupid look on my face trying to comprehend it all. I don't want to be like this. I want to have what my wife has but I'm just not capable of those feelings.,1

I take 15 mg of abilify and 80 mg of celexa. Bipolar anxiety and depression. I also see a counsellor every two weeks to work on cognitive behavioural therapy stuff plus yoga almost everyday at a local studio.,1
"Risperlet, venlor (venlafaxine/aka effaxor?) and tegretol. Just got added another one for severe anxiety but the name escapes me. Been on the same three for just over 5months, was diagnosed properly about 4 years ago and have been guinea pigging meds since trying to find the correct combination",1
Seroquel XR 400 and klonopin for anxiety,1
"I took a blood test that can show how your body metabolizes different medications. Not a clue how it works or what the crazy report means -looks like a bunch of #s and letters to me but it helped. I was told that if you metabolize it too fast it wont get in your system and work. I feel like I tried them all (serequel, abilify, lexapro, zoloft, ambien, xanax, cymbalta, lexapro, topamax, zyprexa). Probably others I have forgotten. Still trying to find the right combo but some had horrible side affects. Just trial and error is all you can do",1

Really liking the Rexulti, I rapid cycle and haven't been this stable in years.",1
"I take lamictal, safris oraly , invega and. Abilify shots for bipolar one and clonopin and seroquel for anxiety, it's a big cocktail but it's totally worth it my bipolar simptoms r under control for the meantime,   ",1
"I have BP II. Lamictal, Wellbutrin, Zoloft,  1-2 100 mg Seroquel for anxiety (my psychiatrist took me off all benzos) 400mg of Seroquel at night, primarily for sleep.",1
Lamictal but I just started and I think it might be causing me to become aggravated in the afternoon so I'm gonna keep taking it to give it a chance but will stop if it gets worse. I really don't want to go on lithium.  Latuda works great for me at the right dose but my legs get too jumpy and my body is restless so I can't take it which sucks because otherwise it's perfect for me.  Also take klonopin for anxiety nothing for depression as I am resistant to all ssris and ssnris I've tried almost all of them and none worked.  Never taken abilify.  Did try a new med called Vraylar but had a severe reaction to full unrinary retention and needed a Foley catheter for 2 weeks that was months ago and I'm still having urinary issues with delayed urination,1
"I take Lithium (1200mg/day) and Seroquel XR (600mg/day), i'm still not sure if that's the right combo for me because my anxiety plays tricks on me so it's hard to tell, i'm seeing a therapist for my anxiety instead of taking more meds.",1
I take lithium and Seroquel. I found the right med combo for me about 3 years ago but it was one of the hardest things I ever went through. I got diagnosed after a very bad and long manic episode so while I was finding the right meds I was depressed everyday for months and spent a lot of time sleeping. I tried a lot of different meds before I found the right ones. My mom and stepdad were very supportive and let me stay with them. I also went to a bipolar support/educational group once a week that was so helpful. The leader taught us about bipolar and how to talk to our doctors since it can be hard in the beginning describing how you feel and knowing the doctor lingo. I went off my meds recently for a few months and ended up in another manic episode and in the mental hospital. But I've been back on my meds for about a month and am finally feeling back to my normal self thank goodness! I was taught that the best combination for bipolar is a mood stabilizer to keep you from going too low and an antipsychotic to keep from going into manias. I also took an anti anxiety med in the beginning because I had very bad social anxiety while trying to find the right meds. I hope the best for you I know how hard it is. I was actually very against medications when I first got diagnosed but truly had no other option and now at this point I am so grateful for it. I would hear people talk in my support group about feeling like the person that were intended to be on meds and I never thought it would be that way for me and it is. I hope that is helpful and wish nothing but the best for you ❤,1

So I say them down and watched Andy Griffith show . I showed them how he calls his dad  pa. I became pa and they never felt like they were missing out on anything. I became pa to every one that they new. I had kids calling me pa I never new but always answered them like we new each other for years.

"Upon his observations Falret noticed that anxiety is a part of rapid cycling moods and  Bipolar Disorder as is. Source, Touched With Fire by K. R. Jamison.",1
"Rapid cycling Bipolar Disorder is particularly almost impossible to live with as mania and depression over short periods or even from day to day. The moods may even merge as they mix, and so we have rapid cycling mixed moods. There is a link between mania and depression. Thus with a mixed state mania is depression in a more intense form. Mania and depression are, which are dreadful diseases, are one disorder.  Mania can, moreover but distinguished from depression by degree and   manifestation. Jean Pierre Falret, in the mid-nineteenth century posited that strong depression often occurs before, during and after mania. Bipolar Disorder is a truly dreadful illness, and I have the rapid cycling divergent form with hypo mania which is more difficult to treat. I would not wish it on anyone.",1

She refuses to get help and she demanded a break from me because she claimed I didn't understand. All I ever tried to do was get her to get help and take responsibility for her actions. She won't get help and it's hard on me because I'm autistic and can't communicate properly.

I have caused her pain with my meltdowns but I always apologize and try to understand but she just won't. It's hard to know what to do anymore because nothing gets through to her    people judge me too and reject me when I get too emotional for them to handle and tell me to handle things myself plus I complain all the time because I can be a drama queen at times so it's very hard dealing with this because the autism community has it especially hard because we want to be accepted for who we are but instead people refuse to be there and try to change us into something we are not.

"I tried coming of meds but started struggling after a week, but everyone is different SO good luck.",1
I've been med free since 2013. But I'm also only bipolar 2 so I don't have huge mania. It's mania to me but by doctors standards it's nothing. I have more depressive episodes than anything and I'm easily stressed but I'm personally better off like this than i was with meds. I also do not have suicidal ideologies and never have so it's probably easier for me than someone with them.  Some people it works for and some it does not.,1
"Once you come off your meds it can stay in the system for a bit. Im currently going without, but thats because i moved and only just got round to changing doctors 5 months later! I do get very low moments and get a bit worried. But im picking myself up, i have found ive seperated myself from people more. Just want my kids around me and family. Im seeing a ne doctor next week though. I guess you just need to be so aware of yourself and any mood change. Meds are not a quick fix and take a while to get into the system. xxx",1
"Oh and Jennifer I think your comment is a little broad-brush. Yes, perhaps it is practically impossible to be 100% symptom-free but that doesn't mean someone not taking meds for it doesn't have bipolar.

I had it for 30 years before I started taking the right meds and I got by just fine - but after taking anti-depressants from my mid 20's I continued to deteriorate rapidly until I was around 30 when a correct diagnosis was made. Since then I've been markedly ""better"" but unfortunately a lot of damage was already done to myself and my life and that's now what I'm struggling with as it amplifies my symptoms.",1
"I doubt that you could be med-free & fully functional, long term, with an illness like bipolar. Me, I rattle like a bottle of pills when I walk and I still struggle a huge amount.

So true! Last night I had a severe panic attack where I literally thought I was dying. Most people don't know how to deal in those situations. My mom jumped in and helped me calm down and she seemed to just know how to be there for me. Those people are treasures in our lives.,1

Anytime anyone has a ""side effect"" and reports it, it will be put on prescription leaflets and websites as a side effect...even if one person in the whole world was the only person to have this side effect, you'll worry yourself sick about having the same experience. Knowledge is power. Discuss with your doctor the side effects that you have experienced on previous meds or that you've heard of others experiencing, they are there to help you( if they are a good doctor that is) and will discuss pros and cons of the medication. I have turned down certain medications because I didn't want to take a chance on certain side effects after discussing it with my doctor. You should never feel afraid to ask your doctor your questions. Different meds are going to work better for others due to their genealogy. There is testing nowadays that they can test what medication would work best with your individual gene structure and has helped stop a lot of the trial and error med trials many of us have endured.

Seroquel=weight gain. For me it meant lots of weight gain. I gained a little over 100 lbs in a little over a year.

"Mixing and rapid cycling of moods.

"I found I cut so that it gave me something to focus on, it forced me to take care of myself... I got lucky, I'm finally on some better meds. My moods are fairly stable for the most part... Better than they have as long as I can remember. I also have an amazing therapy cat that will keep head butting me and trying to get my attention until I stop hyperventilating or crying and ficus on him... At first I didn't know why he was doing it and I used to get mad but I realized he only does it when I'm at my worst. If possible maybe having an emotional support animal might be something to consider.... Someone that needs love and a home that would be grateful for being saved. He or she would help give you something else to focus on. Plus, find a good doctor, see if you need meds if it doesn't work right away try some new ones and don't be afraid to ask for help! HUGS ❤️",1
"When I get to that point I self hospitalize. Just check yourself in and get the help you need in a safe environment, wi th staff that knows how to help and deal with you. I'm really sorry you are feeling so horrible, I get like that too. I'm willing to talk to you just to give you a distraction if you want to pm me. I'd rather you check into a hospital though.    you're not alone",1
"Call someone you know and trust, immediately. Don't be afraid or ashamed. I'm sure there's someone in your phone who you'd drop everything for in an emergency. Try a few people out. You will be surprised. Obviously if it's late at night you may not get an immediate response so DO NOT let that get you down. If no luck, call an ambulance. If it's night time, get in bed and have a good sleep then reflect on your situation in the morning and see a doctor 'yesterday'. It's not abnormal to feel like this - yes it's an illness, but plenty of 'normal' people suffer these things and they just hide it better (which is a bad thing and often makes you worse).

I hesitate to get directly involved with other sufferers, but if you are stuck for someone to talk to you are welcome to send me a message.",1
"It doesn't ease your difficulty, but bear in mind that many of us here, and many people in general society, will have had at least one crushing breakup in their time.

So believe me, you can and WILL get over it. But again remember that won't ease your pain, and don't expect it to. This is a natural reaction to the situation and many people go through different thought processes after such events.

I had one early on as a young lad, and later in life I was divorced not long after. Believe me, I thought I was toast both times.

Years on I now have a loving partner and two kids (not mine, but they act like they are!) who think I'm tops. I still have my struggles but at the end of the day my life is better than I vould ever have imagined.",1
"I used to self harm for many years and looked online at the time for online support groups which helped. I also got over cutting slowly through the help of a very good friend who taught me to write my pain away through journals and poetry id never written poetry until then aged 35 they were deep and dark i started posting them on various self harm forums and it really helped. Im now 46 and last time i cut i was 40 and had been doing it since i was 14. 

Apart from seeking medical help please keep what i called a self care box at hand. New fresh clean razor antiseptic wipes butterfly stiches ect. It keeps you safe i learned that after a wound of mine got badly infected so is very important!

I personally learned i used to cut to forget the pain but in a vicious circle every scar reminded me daily of all the parts of life i was desperate to forget..... Instead of escaping my past each scar is permanent reminder......but i can only see that now i have stopped.... I hope this helps. Xxx",1
"I sought help for my self mutilation as well, after 6 yrs of  hurting myself. I saw a psychiatrist and she diagnosed me with anxiety that was triggering depression/ cutting episodes. I got put on Zoloft and let me tell you, best decision I've ever made. I still experience mild anxiety but I feel no urge to hurt myself now.",1
Just really struggling at the moment. I've been given some numbers to call.,1
If you fear you may hurt yourself or someone else please seek help. You got this we all have had to fight that ugly monster.,1
Super task focused. ..extreme anger if interupted. Can't sleep. Road rage...irrational irritation and agitation.,1
"'Mania' usually associated with Bipolar 1 and person has lack of insight into their behaviour during episode which can have devastating impact on daily life and include lowering of inhibitions, sexual behaviour,  impulsivity, high energy but inappropriate, belief they are invincible, paranoia, fixation etc while 'hypomania' associated with Bipolar 2 and person does not lose insight or display psychotic thoughts but high energy extreme irritability fixated and obssessed with doing something/someone something someone said . Not as extreme as mania but bipolar 2 cycling between depression/ hypomania is often more frequent and hypomamia can last few weeks then occur every few weeks so very unstable",1
"You are not alone. ..during these moments, I am learning to quiet my mind. I could not do this until I was properly medicated. My mantra is ""no big tboughts"". I list my tasks for the day and rely on my list. It eases the mind pressure. I can go from the thought of going to the grocery store. ..to my hatred of people who I believe judge me. I believe you know what I am talking about....ease up on yourself, find a small reprieve.",1
I need to start doing this.. I just got signed up for intermittent LOA where I have 4 /8 hour shifts a month that I can use for call outs(they don't need to be used) if I having a flare up....I have a miscarriage in June and my moods ever since have been horrible. So I ended up getting wrote up at work for my call outs... some days are harder then others and I think this is a great idea so that my doctor can see what my patterns look like... thank you for this idea,1
It's such a shame that companies will work with people with other illnesses but as soon as it comes down to mental illness it's frowned on. I with diagnosed with bipolar disorder/ manic depression/ anxiety when I was 12 years old. I'm 24 now and I have always had to hide my mental illness from jobs. Until now when I finally got wrote up for the second time and I couldn't handle the fact of losing my job. I really hope things work out for you because I know the feeling of having that laying on the back of your mind bringing you down. It's hard but with the right support (your meeting) it sounds like you are doing what you can to get yourself back on track. I need to get into some kinda therapy or something again with all the shit going on right now I feel myself slowly falling and I'm scared I won't be able to catch myself,1
"I'm in a similar situation. I'm currently on a doctor requested LOA for my bipolar/depression/anxiety because I (as I would like to call it) fell down the rabbit hole. I've been in a rut since December. If I had to back track my moods, I would say that most of my days would of been black or red. 
Anyways. I'm in an IOP, and I'm more than sure when I return from my LOA I'll be terminated because I've taken so many dYs off, that I'm negative unpaid sick hours (they give you 20hrs every quarter, and since I was denied my last LOA (which previously set me back to -72) I am now -150 ish hours, I have nothing to cover them.",1
I did lamitcal and tomapax together for my bipolar.   Then xanax for anxiety.       Worked good for years but then I had a episode. .... now I'm back to trying to find right combo,1
"Don't let your doc treat symptoms, you Just have bipolar like me, anxiety and depression are just part of the game. I'm currently on 900 mg of lithium, only side affect I've noticed (been on it about 17 months now) is sometimes I feel a tad drowsy after, nothing a cup of coffee can't fix though. 
My appetite sometimes is out of whack too but I think that's more from the actual disorder then the medication cause I've always either eaten excessively or barely at all as long as I remember",1
Unfortunately side effect if many antipsychotic and mood stabilizing drugs is weight gain. Sedation is also a side effect of many hence they are used at low doese for sleep.  There are loads of different medications and what works for o e person may not work for another . Sadly only way of finding out is to try them. It is trial and error. I take it by say you Bipolar anxiety and bipolar depression you mean you have Bipolar disorder? I've no idea what country you are from so i dont know what healthcare system. You need to clearly explain your symptoms and that side effects are outweighing the benefits of medications and discuss others you can try.,1
"Bipolar 1, panic disorder, PTSD, ADHD. With years of MD'S practicing on me. Now on lamictal, and lithium. I no longer I need anti-anxiety medication or sleep medication. I had to find the right dr. Who was actually LISTENING to me. And it took me years to figure out that medical doctors need to stop thinking they can do a psychiatric doctors job. Although e even in the beginning of that relationship I'm a lot more medication than that ever truly hard at meditation natural herbs essential oils anything that I can do to not have to swallow one more pill I'm down to two!",1
"I agree with Bettina, find a new doctor. My psychiatrist put me on risperidone for PTSD, he tried me on SSRI anti depressants like fluoxetine, escitalipram snd sertraline. They didn't work for me but they may work for you. He also put me on imipramine which is another anti depressant that I take to this day. I tried gabapentin for anxiety and diazepam. 

Meds work differently for everyone and you have to find someone who's willing to keep on trying different meds to see what works for you",1

"Hey Leah, I'm sorry you are going thru this. It can be completely overwhelming. One of the things that this illness does is rob us of control over ourselves and our lives. I am a firm believer in regaining much if not all of that control back! Rick has found an excellent way to not only regain control of his body, but also his thought processes. He is acting in his own best interest as a coach! One of the three pillars to regain our health that I espouse for all of us. Feel free to contact me and I'll spend some time with you and see if I can be of help. James",1
"I am undiagnosed but doubtless bipolar. The only thing that ever helped more than medication and counseling was cleaning my diet and daily exercise, until it hurts. Started off with 20 minutes around the block, every day and became a habit. I ordered some kettle bells to work at home, and that hurts too. It gives me a high, and the pain isn't nearly what I suffered with  severe active diagnosis. I wake up with a head of old 'recordings' and they burn off like the morning fog. Now I can see a future, and medication was cut in half in 30 days. It was the solution for me. It was the only thing I had not tried. A better life awaits me outside of my head. I wish you well.",1
"Yes, I do that when my stress and anxiety is really high, almost like a feeling of vertigo, and then it passes",1
yes. its my anxiety.,1
"I also have that. Its all pary of anxiety. I got that feeling for 3 days in a row and it ended up in a panic attack in a restaurant. I didnt even knew at the time what a panic attack was like. I was taken to emergencies and that was what they discovered. It works for me to go lie down even if i get that slightest feeling, for 10 min and relax each muscle and mind. Hope it works for u",1
"U should try to never be out of meds. If i start to get panic attacks now, i breath in and out in a brown paper bag and i put a mild sedative under the tongue. Try and do 10 min of complete relaxation per day in the afternoon or evening",1
Yup makes sense I've been under a lot of stress and anxiety the last few days plus the weather change affects my anxiety too. I had panic disorder for over 10 years which progressed into GAD I'm out of meds right now so maybe I will try some tea and a bath until I get more,1
I was told years ago I had bipolar type two but then told I did not so years of trying to manage my severe anxiety and depression by self and begging for someone to help I got phychosis from being so ill so was sectioned hospital stay for couple months 2 years later I had a manic episode and was sectioned and then a depressive episode and sectioned then told I have bipolar 1 and 2 if treated in the first place I would not have gone on to mania and had phychosis again I'm on lots of meds hate it but keeps me stable but feel flat and like a zombie in the morngings . The mania is completely different than to manic in type 2 this time I thought I was working for the CIA I was also eve my partner was Adam etc  but the low after the come down is so horrid .  It's hard for us all as we have to stay positive to stay well but days where we feel so fatigued and heavy,1
I have bipolar type 1 Rapid Cycling forgot to add anxiety and panic attacks,1
Also have mixed states  and rapid cycling. I am bipolar 1. My manic episodes manifest in extreme itritability and uncontrollable  aggression and rage. Following on it's heels deep depression. Last few months seldom normal episodes. Keep getting up and down.,1

"Read the product rundown online. You'll find an info sheet. It will give a list of minor and major sid effects and instruction to immediately discontinue use or seek urgent medical advice for any extreme effects.

I'm not familiar with the drug itself but they will all have some side effects and in most cases they are worse at the start until your body gets used to things.

Also make sure you're eating well and drinking plenty of water.

One of the drugs I'm on... er... blocks me up... so I can get stomach pains from that.

Don't be afraid to tell your doctor you're not comfortable with the drug and ask to try something different, but at the same time if it's a minor ish side effect (eg constipation) then it might go away of its own accord or be fixed with a change to diet etc.",1

Suicidal ideation",1
"Suicidal ideation isn't actually a diagnosis. It just means you have suicidal thoughts, which is common with ptsd and bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy has shown to be very successful in helping with that, if you haven't tried it. There's a book by David Burns called Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy that I love. That was our curriculum when I was in the hospital. It's also very effective with depression and anxiety. :)",1
"You don't have to serve in the military to have ptsd. 

Do not quit taking your meds without talking to your doctor. To help fight stomach upset, try taking it with food. But call your Dr regardless.",1
You can only live in the moment...try not to think about next time instead focus on the moment you are in right now....they say one day at a time but the truth is its one moment at a time....thunk about your babies and know they need you...they will always need you. I cry on my dogs shoulder all too often...and I also fear calling any hot lines because like you what would I say...I kept it all inside for fear of losing my children if anyone found out...but recently I confided in the last person I thought I would get support from and it'd a slow process but a huge release. I've always feared being judged as I've had a pretty good life yet I've always been suicidal since I was 8 or 9....I don't know why just have been...and not knowing is OK tooo...just find a person you can trust and open up to them..or even post like you did here that's why we are here...to help others not judge! I am Thankful you are here and that you had the courage to speak out...it's nice knowing you're not alone. ♡,1
"When you feel suicidal but still have doubts, call your local Mental Health Center or ER of the nearest hospital. They know what  to do.",1
Thank God your still here with us sharing your story! I will pray for you and tell you it will get better! There is so many people feeling this way day in day out who don't talk about it! So thank you for opening up! Believe me someone needed to hear this today including myself! I struggle all the time but it helps when I know I am not alone! Thank you and I am glad your still here!,1
"You can worry about that one day when it comes. For now, all that matters is you are still here.",1
I am prescribed it for sleep. Not getting enough sleep causes my anxiety to highten and then I can't sleep so it a vicious cycle.  So yes. It makes you tired.,1
I was taking the 150 but they put me on the 300 and I've been having to break them up I've been noticing at night some leg restlessness with this dose so I'm hoping I can switch back once my Medicaid goes through to the pharmacy cause I didn't experience it till I got those. :/,1
"I'm on 200mg at night makes me so hungry after I've taken it I could eat the furniture, also blocked nose and restless legs",1
I used to take 600mg every night. I couldn't wake up I  couldn't go to school I couldn't remember shit and it gave me HORRIBLE restless foot syndrome. Like to the point I'm talking asleep but my foot needed to be moving I'd cry every night. I stopped taking that shit. Its not worth it.,1
8kg  i put on now im fuckd in sweet land  shake it off,1
"I was taking the lowest dose you can for my period, I actually got worse because my lack of energy made me upset. I had issues with school and have really been struggling to keep up on life due to it. I stopped taking the friday ( my doctor said I could also take as needed ) I won't ever be taking that again.",1
"I take 600mg every night,can get by on 6 hours sleep and work 50 hours a week,works well for me,when I was really struggling I was on 900mg",1
"I take 600mg every night... it stuffs my nose like fucking crazy. The important thing is to take it right before you go to bed,  and don't stay up late... or you'll be half dead in the morning (energy wise) 
Sometimes my blood pressure drops when I stand to walk and I'll get insanely dizzy... have to sit back down. I tried going off it a couple times, doing so made me highly sensitive to lights. I find it more therapeutic taking it,  than NOT taking it...I can't sleep without it, which sets off mania. I'm bipolar 1 with ultra rapid cycling...",1
Yes and it was absolutely horrible. Changed doctors who then changed my meds afta awhile and now I'm on an even keel.,1
I take it 3 times a day and yes it does tend to make me sleepy but most the time it's better to take it and be sedated to a point then dealing with the irritability and Mania that I have without it,1
My anxiety panic attacks and irritability are so bad that I have to take it 3 times a day once in the morning when I get up once around lunch time and once again at bedtime,1
The higher the dose...the worse tbe restlegs legs. Nothing like being exhausted and unable to lay down. I was on it for years. The extended release version helped the restless legs.,1
It gives me restless legs and don't even make me sleepy,1
seroquel is known for being sedating. I was never irritable or confrontational on it. But I suppose it is possible.,1
Its suppose to help me with sleeping but sometimes I doubt it. I also take a quarter in the morning which leaves me feeling flat and tired.,1
I hate the restless legs I get when I start to fall asleep,1
I didn't take it long enough to become irritable and confrontational. BUT it made me dead tired. I would sleep 13-14 hours and still find it hard to function. Stopped taking it very quickly,1
"Hi Jenni! I'm on two types of seroquel, I take 50mg slow release and 50mg of instant release. 
I tried taking slow release in the morning (I take the instant release at night) and it just made me sooooo tired, so I just started taking it at night with my other ones! Works wonders. 

How long have you been on seroquel? The first month or so for me was awful, I had countless panic attacks and I was never happy, eventually it worked out for me! Hopefully it does for you too!! 

I'm no doctor but I hope it helps! Good luck, let me know how you go! Xx",1
"I'm on Seroquel ""extended release"" (XR), 600 mg/day. Maybe it's the extended release that never made me tired or feel any irritability.",1
"Yup, that was me. I got told if this is me on meds, I was better off without them. I wanted to give it more time and then the warnings at work and the car crash... done. Then tried lamictal. Felt AMAZING within a week! Day 6... rash started, gave it a few more days but it got worse and my Dr called me in immediately. It was the bad one that can turn life threatening. Done again. Tried geodon next... day 3, pancreatic episode (I have recurring pancreatitis) so done again.",1
Same and without it I just can't function it keeps my moods stable my head clear enough to function daily and I know if I stopped taking it all that would change for the worst ...... other than dry mouth and sometimes of late restless legs I'm happy to be taking it it gave me my life back and my families too xx,1
"Ive been taking Seroquel for years...regular, not XR. I was on 300mg but got restless leg syndrome so bad i had to drop it to 200mg, which helped. Otherwise i love it. Helps me sleep. I notice when i forget to take it.",1
"It is simply a mood stabilizer basically for me it slows my brain down enough to recognize my ""illogical thoughts"" or that I am in an episode. When things get stressful my body still responds to it to anxiety and exhaustion is one of those things. Could you be going through something that is more stressful then normal? Has this occurred the whole year or just in moments?",1
I was only on small doses and I had to stop because I fell asleep at the wheel of my car. The drowsiness was extreme. I couldn't function. I was irritable but I put that down to my bipolar not being stable. Meds react with different people in different ways.,1
"Seroquel gave me horribly violent nightmares. And yes, I experienced some aggressive feelings.",1
I have BP 2 and it is  often missed and diagnosed as depression anxiety because most people seek help during depressive phases and these can be more obvious. The hypomania a person can come across as be really energetic or irritable and anxious agitated  fixated or obssessed with something and then lasts for a few weeks. It generally doesn't involve losing touch with reality or lack of insight / self awareness as with mania. The cycling between hypomania and depression is generally more frequent in BP2 and can be just as difficult to manage because of this frequent mood changes.                                   In fact to be diagnosed with BP1 a person only ever has to have 1 episode of mania and sometimes they never have another one.,1
"Generally:

Type 1: severe episodes of manic (at least one) and depressive episodes 

Type 2: hypomanic episodes (at least one) and severe depressive episodes

There are other types of bipolar disorder that no one talks about it, like Cyclothymic disorder is a mild version of bp2, with mild hypomanic and mild depressive episodes. I have been diagnosed with cyclothymia, although i feel i'm bp2 at times, it feels like living on the edge, it frustrates me, sometimes i feel i just want depression to hit hard i lose it all, but I can't, it just makes my anxiety levels very high, sometimes it feels i'm hanging in mid-air, not sure when i'm going to fall and at the same time wishing i could fall and be done with it.",1
"I got bi polar 1 and it sucks ..
I also have 
PTSD
BI POLAR 1

so its hard for me to explain sorry but people on here are doing a very good job of explaining it ..",1
I am bipolar 2 i have more lows than highs and my highs are mostly irritability with a lot of energy. I believe bipolar 1 is more highs than lows and their highs are extreme,1
"Louise, thank you. I'm more manic most the time now. But with my meds and therapy I've learned to recognize it and ""try"" to control it. Being that I now have many anxiety issues plus some OCD,  I'm struggling but doing my best. I just do deep breathing along with walking away from the situation till I get my center again. Long 40 yrs. It has been.   ",1
In simple terms bipolar I is the more severe of the 2. You experience extreme highs where things are completely irrational and severe lows where things couldn't get much worse. Bipolar 2 is not so severe but just as real and hard to deal with.,1
"if you are unsure, you can call your pharmacy and ask. They are good with stuff like that.",1
"1. See a psychologist. A lot can be achieved (and I was very cynical) through letting a stranger into your head. Psychologists are not medical doctors (although they can be also) as such, but work on therapy by assisting with identifying issues, patterns, challenging ideas that you are set on etc. You may need to see one or two different ones before you find one you're comfortable with.
2. Don't talk yourself or a doctor INTO a diagnosis. Bipolar is normal, just an extreme version of normal where your ups and downs are more common and more severe. Don't think you're sicker than you are, but if you actually are then don't worry because there are heaps of different options out there.
3. Drugs work different on different people. Some get benefits, some don't, some get side effects, some don't. I stopped counting at about a dozen different drugs I've been on over the years to find an improvement, and then to fine tune it. Don't expect the first pill to be the silver bullet and dont be afraid to tell your doctor if you're not happy with something you're on. Try to document things as best you can eg. Felt super down no reason tonight, sleeping patterns are off, felt lethargic this morning, im getting xYZ side effects, etc. It's hard to recall everything when you're right in front of your doctor.
4. If you ARE bipolar then antidepressants are unlikely to fix your problem. You will also need a mood stabilizer or anti psychotic (not necessarily for psychosis, they can be used to bring mood peaks down and to improve sleep).
5. Someone once told me ""medication is the ladder, correct diagnosis is the step toward it, but you are responsible for climbing it"". The translation here is that you will have to put in effort to identify and fix problems, or if there are none (and honestly who has no oriblems!!) Then look at positive changes in your life. Electronic devices off before bed (as I type this it's 2.31am in Australia - oops), force yourself to go to bed at a reasonable time, force yourself to rest even if you can't fall asleep - try not to get wound up about not sleeping and just enjoy the chillout), force yourself to get up at a reasonable hour, incorporate some exercise into your day (an early morning walk is a great way to get yourself out of bed early, to feel good straight away. And to have 'achieved' something before you've even started what would be your normal day.
6. Watch your diet. Sugars, stimulants (coffee), high calorie and high-GI foods lend themselves to 'buzz' and 'crash' scenarios.
7 . The G in GP is for GENERAL. It means they have more knowledge than the average population on most medical topics, but no specialist knowledge. You should see a specialist, in the case of this illness that would be a psychiatrist. Don't be ashamed, it's normal. People get sick. It's an illness. You're not crazy or faulty.
8. Share. Find some friends you can talk to about it. I guarantee there's practically no-one you see or work with that would say 'no' if you said you weren't doing well and would like a chat.
9. Don't get caught in the 'this is me' trap. Yes your illness is closely linked to your personality and something you can't change, but that doesn't mean you have to spend all your time on depression sites or reading/sharing depressive memes. I find that makes the situation worse n- you feel at first like it's good that soneone relates to you but on the whole you're just surrounding yourself with negativity. Focus on positive things, positive changes, and you'll not only get better but you'll actually be better than many 'normal' people because you will learn a lot about yourself, other people, and tools for everyday life.",1
"Get a referal to a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed around 21 (mother also bp). Don't worry. You will find the rights meds. But antidepressants alone are no good for bp as they can get you manic. If you are bp you will also need a mood stabaliser, such as lithium. Good luck   ",1
"Emily Dickinson was far from successful.  She was a recluse due to her struggles,  and her work was largely unpublished during her lifetime.",1
"This is something I find myself repeating with people who are newly diagnosed or not understanding of the illness. You can still live your dream. You will still have your passion and joy. It dosen't go away. But it can make things harder.  Learn your body, track your moods, pay attention to yourself and you'll find what works and what dosen't for you.  Even if you can only manage to work on something 10 minutes a day... thats 10 minutes of work more than the day before. I had always wanted to write fiction, I was never encouraged or supported and when I broke under life pressure and my mental illness I felt it time to kill the dream. Then I met my wonderful partner who found my notes and half written stories and told me to keep going. It was slow and I won't lie, hard some days. I finished my first novella after almost 3 years of labor and am now working on the sequel.  I'm honestly not the best writer, things are sometimes hard for me to convey (I had 3 amazing friends beta reading to help). I may never make a full living off my works, but that was never the point. I have stories in my head screaming for life and I have a duty to provide it.",1
People helping need to really understand this. It is so easy to put on a mask when leaving the house for short periods of time. But that's not the whole story and most pain is below the surface. It takes allot of strength for the one being helped and the helper to go below the surface. It can be messy and stressful but in the end it can become very therapeutic. Have empathy not sympathy.,1

Self talk they tell me is the best therapy talk sometimes I don't understand how? I'm currently super depressed right now and my last two counseling sessions that's all I've heard.... self talk... good luck the struggle is real.,1
"I thought I was reading about myself. This has always been one of my biggest fears. I have a history of suicide attempts and have always failed. I am fearful I will not be strong enough to resist, it has happened many times before. Keep on talking about this. Bring it to the forefront for discussion. Sometimes I dread going to sleep for fear of waking up the next day. In my eyes just writing what you have shows you are aware of your situation.",1
So proud of you for being so strong last night. I have been where you are. I was not so strong as you but I survived. The guilt still haunts me today. Take it one day at a time. The feeling will get better I promise.,1
"You prove you are a strong person because you are here to share this story with us. We all are stronger than ""normal"" people because each day is another day where they might find stressful, it's double for us. Never doubt your problems are too petty to talk to someone about...we are all important...and we are all strong even in our weakest moments. Stay strong and you indeed are not alone in this battle daily.❤",1
"I am so so proud of you for talking yourself down, it's not an easy thing to do. I understand your fears for future episodes, but focus on the positive. You managed to say ""no, screw you"" and that is the hardest thing to do. Make yourself a hot drink turn on a movie and look after yourself and relax. You did so well.   ❤️  ",1
"I have a huge issue with motivation. I can't get going and the thought of doing some things gives me a feeling of dread. Sounds pathetic I know, but that's the way it is with me. I feel flat most of the time but at least I'm not depressed. My medication is working OK, but don't know what to do about motivation.",1
"Although I don't look miserable when I'm depressed, I tend to look blank, or perhaps disinterested. People pick up on this and avoid me.",1
"I was hospitalized 15 days through police intervention. The doctor finally told me to answer just the questions directly as he was trying to decide if I was depressed or bipolar. I am bipolar with depression. That does not mean I don't have manic episodes also. Steve Wajda is correct. Bipolar meds are a combination of many types, some with harsh side effects and costly. Previously, for 25 years my diagnosis was chronic depression with anxiety.  I eventually became someone who I did not know existed...very angry and destructive along with manic spending sprees. My children became afraid of me. As I look back at my history, I can identify times when I was definitely showing symptoms of bipolar, severe. Your awareness is a positive attribute and do not give up on getting the proper diagnosis and help. Be persistent. Have someone close to you verify your situation also with your psychiatrist or therapist, my husband did for me (though I hated him at the time for doing so).",1
"Always difficult when dearling with depression and anxiety.  I would not suggest another diagnosis, until depression and anxiety are stable.  Once stable, coaching of how to 'read' what your body is telling you; coaching of ways to increase strength, coaching for limiting drama-fears, might even  stablize depression and anxiety more  I know someone who has stablized, D & A, and doesn't show any signs of bipolar, today.    Bless you....breather.....slow down, but sleep, breathe, do what you love.",1
"I also use to think I had schizophrenia because of the rage that was inside me, it used to make me that angry that I would attack myself and self destruct as much as I could and the thoughts that ran through my mind were so sadistic and quite sickening but it was just part of my borderline and came with my rage fits. 

I'm past that now, I no longer feel suicidal when I have outbursts and no longer self destruct or self harm. I can control my moods 10 times better than I used to. All because I got the right help and the right treatment for my problem. 

Meds ever worked for me so I forced myself off of them. I'm now med free for my problems but I still take mertazapine occasionally for sleep as I have bad insomnia. 

I found the only mer that ever did help with my anxiety, depression AND mood stabilisation, was mertazapine. All the others I tried made things worse, harder to deal with or turned me dumb. 

Seroquel for instance, literally caused me to start stuttering and losing my mind. I couldn't even reply to someone when they asked me my name or date of birth because I couldn't remember. I started feeling dumb and embarrassed so j stopped taking it and writhing 3 weeks I was myself again. No more stuttering or forgetfulness. 

But all meds work for different people. I just don't ever reconnect seroquel to people because of my effects. 

It's trial and error with everything. Whether it be pills, therapy or finding the right person to diagnose you, when one fails, try and try again. 

Goodluck with finding the root of your problems so you can get the right help that you need. :) I hope you have some understanding soon.",1
"I have bpd and I used to think it was bipolar because I couldn't control my anger and would constantly have major rage fits and outbursts but I was diagnosed with bpd and I'm now in dialectical behavioural therapy for it to learnt to control my emotions, it has saved me from myself. 

I suffer from constant anxiety and depression along with unstable moods and constant fear of abandonment. 
It's hard to deal with but now that I know what my problem is, learning about it comes easily and is easier for me to help myself. 

But you need to be persistent with your psych and if they don't help you to find out your diagnosis than you need to keep trying with others until you find one that will diagnose you. 

I tried and tried and I couldn't find the help I needed, until one night when I took myself to hospital to the psych ward very suicidal, they had a proper psych come in and sit with me for 3 hours asking me all these different questions about my past and present and my moods and anger troubles. In a week he had me in proper therapy to figure out what was wrong with me and I was finally diagnosed. Ever since, I've made it priority to learn about my diagnosis and do everything I can to make myself better and change the way my mind processes. It's hard, so hard, but the more I keep doing it, the better I'm becoming. 

I tried medication after medication, councillor after councillor, psychiatrist after psychiatrist, until I finally found one that I liked and who gave proper time for me and made sure to do everything in her will to help me. She started printing out modules of how to deal with distress intolerance and made me work through them and learn to control the way I react to my distressing situations. Made me work out what my triggers and warning signs were etc. 

I've come so far in only 8-9 months and I'm proud of that, but I know I'm not yet where I want to be and still have a long way to go. 

But if it wasn't for me persisting to get help, the right help, I wouldn't be where I am today. 

You just need to be persistent, yet patient at the same time. 

You will get there. Just keep trying and do your best to find both a psychiatrist and psychologist whom not only helps you to figure out your problems but also makes you feel comfortable and able to talk about everything and anything that could help diagnose you. 

If you can't find one that helps you feel like you're getting somewhere with things, go to the hospital and admit yourself for assessment. I had to to get the right help, you don't need to stay there it's just for the right assessment instead of those k10 forms that doctors fill out to diagnose depression and anxiety and stuff. It's not that simple and it takes a long time to dig deep to figure out the problem. It can't take 5 minutes   

Just keep trying. You will get there.",1
"Mania or hypomania is what gives you the diagnosis. 
For me it can be euphoria the world is a wonderful place and everybody is my friend. It can also be rage, irritability. 
Your behaviour can be reckless, financially, sexually, even driving the car.
You may believe you are the fountain of all knowledge, you can accomplish anything, you are unstoppable and that can include talking.
Sleep is a good indication of mania you can get by with very little, sometimes none.",1
Yes that's what my general doctor is worried about with my past history,1
"I have been told all I could take was zoloft. I'm 7 months pregnant and have been on zoloft for a while. Doctor recently upped the dose for me since I was getting bad again. I have a mild bi polar disorder, depression, anxiety, and ptsd. Zoloft keeps me stable right now.",1
"I agree with everyone. Everyone is different and responds differently to different meds. It took me years to find what worked for me. I'm Bipolar 2 with anxiety and PTSD. My psychiatrist has me on Cymbalta, Geodon, Topamax, and Valium. But everyone is different. Find what works for you and your symptoms",1
"I take Effexor, Wellbutrin, Epival, and Seroquel.  BP2 and anxiety disorder.",1
"i was dignosed bi polar with bpd 10 years ago now. i have not been able to find medication that didnt make me feel like doing self harm. i gave up on psychs and therapists and trying to figure out meds. i TRY to manage my mental health myself, i struggle on a daily basis. i do not recommend this path to anyone.",1
"Its taken me 16 years to find the right doctor and right combination. I'm on Prestiq and Rexulti, both of which I couldn't afford without the medication program through the pharmacy at the mental health clinic I go to. I have severe anxiety and depression and since being on this combo I finally feel normal after many years of struggling. You will get there, just don't give up.",1
"Everyone , and everyone's brain is different and what works for others may not work for you. It will be trial and error. Recently after new clinical depressive episode I was put on Sertraline by a new doctor and in two weeks I felt much much worse. I went back and insisted on going back on to what had worked for me before , Citalaprim. Now three weeks later by brain has stopped doing the negative stuff and rumenating and the anxiety has left me. So try to describe to you doctor as accurately as you can your symptoms and the degree you experience them. The meds are of course only part of the solution, life changes and diet are far more beneficial, although not discounting the role of meds in stabilising the worst vessels of brain/ emotional illness.",1
My pet hate with BPD is the fear of rejection and the sense of abandonment that can be so intense whether founded on fact or fiction,1
"Actually I have this issue, I call this more to do with paranoia that can stem from any mental disorder and not BPD in itself. This is not only BPD and from the this is written it comes across strongly as if this is only BPD and a symptom.",1
It is one of several characteristics of BPD. It's not saying this is the only symptom of BPD or that only people with BPD experience this just that this is a common to a lot of people with BPD and can be very destructive as well as upsetting for both others and for person with BPD especially as quite often is not based on reality but due to BPD and its effect on individuals ability to process and regulate emotions and interpret other people's.,1
"....Because it is still so little understood, under researched and u set funded and it's frightening - duh! We need to stop calling it mental illness and call it brain illness. We don't call people with dementia or Alzheimer's mentally ill, so why label other brain located illnesses under this useless label.",1
Also.. I really think it is the name attached to it.. Humans are afraid of illness and when they hear the word it can tend to make one feel uncomfortable.. Or powersless..  And its human nature to fear what we don't understand.,1
I'm not really afraid of it.. I'm more afraid of what others think of it.. That may sound.. Well how it sounds to another.. Hehe and yes that caused me  little fear.. I just want to be loved like everyone else. Even you.,1
"I know exactly how you feel. I would never give advice or offer hope, as I am conscious that every sufferer is unique. Just wanted to share that after mis-read medication, I am now 3 weeks back on medication I have used before - Citalaprim - and it appears to be working for me again and lifted my mood enough to be able to get up, face the day and do things and laugh. I hope your fog clears, even a little. If not on any meds or if you are and they are not working go back to your GP. Also sleep/ insomnia/anxiety meditations by Lina Grace have helped me a great deal as well as other insights on YouTube - Andrew Solomon on TED Talks, talking about depression. Others too. The 'loneliness' , or sense of it, of the experience even if we have partners beside us, is I found one of the hardest symptoms. Look for and seek the moments of respite, however short, there is hope in them and in drawing them out to longer experiences. Do what makes you smile, relax, switch off, distract you from your dark thoughts - e en if writing on this FB page. I have started writing  every day, even if only a couple of sentences - my autobiography- which will never be published. Thoughts with you.",1
"In a world that teaches you self doubt, liking yourself is a rebellious act..go on, do it, like yourself, you need to be on your own side..if you think others don't like you, the least you can do is like yourself! Please! Learn to adore who you are...you of all people should love yourself more than anyone else loves you. Rebel. You can!",1
Oh man how I have struggled with this with a very close friend of mine. He isolates himself when he is depressed and I am an over giver. One thing I've found helpful in maintaining healthy boundaries is to journal what I'm thinking and feeling during those times when I'm really worried about him. Check in regularly but in a balanced way. Then when he seeks support you can let him know some of the things you were thinking.,1
"I'm an isolator myself. Anxiety & depression for over a year now. I just wish to be left alone and for my friends to respect that. Unfortunately, I think they've forgotten about me. I'm not ready  to see them in person but it would be nice if they reached out every now & then.",1
"I wouldn't like to judge because I've been in that bad place before but I hope you don't feel pressured into anything, seems a bit like he wants more from your relationship. Don't feel guilted into anything and remember this isn't your responsibility but also try to help in a way that isn't detrimental to your own mental health X x",1
"I am not a professional and don't know the exacts of your situation, but  I will speak as someone who, similar to your friend, pushed everyone away with the intention to die alone. He is not thinking straight while sick, and desperately needs you and needs help. Even if he is mad at you now, if he can get better he'll understand and you'll be closer for it. He is hurting you to push you away, not because he is actualy mad. Staying in his life is a start, though may not be enough. If you are able to contact his therapist or doctor please do so and let them know what is going on and ask what you can do to help more. Try and find a way to ease his isolation as best you can, try to get him to engage in activities with you. There is also a program in many areas refered to as a Baker Act, I recomend it only as a last ditch effort if he is showing signs of self harm or immediate danger. It is drastic and harsh, but if it saves his life it is worth it.",1
I have a major deal of it for almost 40 years if you leave him isolated he will go nuts and may do the wrong choice isolating I have done it is like being in your own jail!: ((( it's horrible,1
Absolutely. I struggle at work so by the time I get home I'm in bed watching tv by 6:30. I can't stand being anywhere else. I sent to dose for an hr or two then wake but it's still better to be asleep even for a little while awake.,1
"Yeah definitely. I have depression and anxiety and I often fall asleep around 2, 3pm. Constantly worrying about things makes us so tired",1
"It's horrible isn't it, I have all these ideas and thoughts in my head about how i could improve my life and get better but when it comes down to it I'm stuck and nothing changes",1
This is great but as Yenz has said it's so hard to do I would really love to do this anybody else struggle with it? :/,1
I struggle to do all ov them lol. Just having sum1 to talk to with out them thinking am mad is bad anuf.,1
Anxiety attacks are not only about fear,1
I had a massive panic attack once when out with my sister. Saw someone who looked like my abusive biological mom. I told her I needed to find somewhere to hide for a bit. She said she could see the panic on my face. She helped me find a hideaway then stood outside it to protect me while I got it under control. When I came out she just asked if I was ok and we went on doing what we were doing b,1
"panic attacks are real , IF you have never had one then you don't know . True or not they happen everyday .",1
Except my husband actually is leaving me... worst nightmare coming true.  But you know what? I don't think my anxiety caused it... I think I sensed it and my anxiety skyrocketed.,1
"...and from the outside it's hard for those who care to tell that it's happening to those with anxiety. Then there is the person who is dependent on one person (as is my down syndrome daughter) to take care of them and knows that when that person is gone it's very likely that one one else will really give a damn about them, that is not anxiety that is real and tragic and there is no cure or pill for real. Combine the 2nd situation with anxiety and it's crushing.",1
Am glad you have the opposite of what happened to me. Never had that in my life and when I thought I might have it...the person left...insulted me and threatened to throw me in jail. I would sell my soul to get just one person from your life in mine.,1
Serious anxiety seriously hurts.,1
"BI-POLAR with anxiety, stress, phobias is a bitch. Depression

I pushed everyone away and I got pushed out. Its my fault I know but I never lied to anybody thAt tried to get close to me physically or mentally. They had no idea it was that bad it always looks easy to handle in books but when faced directly on with this issue people get scared they don't know how I will act day to day so they walk on eggshells around me which I never picked up on. People dont come near me because I am unpredictable I have never known this till recently. I have no way to repair the damage that has been afflicted to the countless people.I try to fix it but I make it Alot worse. I have nobody to turn to because I am afraid of damaging them as well,1
This fucking suck this is one of my main problem I hate anxiety! I wish there's no PSTD so I wouldn't act like this!    this is very hard to change sometimes,1
It is now Saturday 5:31 am I haven't been able to sleep since Thursday welcome to anxiety it will be fun they said!  They lied can I return it?,1
"I have PTSD bi polar high anxiety depression ADHD
How in the hell is that going to work for me .wait it won't 
1 - 1 1/2 hours aday is my norm",1
what utter bollocks when anxiety strikes u just don't think of any of these things  and this is the problem  anxiety isn't funny its a real serious issue  these are like telling someone who needs crutches   oh if you do x y or z you wont need them  so STOP TELLING people how to control anxiety  I'm totally pissed off with this  and now removing this post and your page,1
"If only all that crap worked. You can't sleep, you don't want to eat...or over eat and all wrong things, comfort food. Talk to someone? people don't want to know about your anxiety issues...or so I've found, so I keep to myself now & don't talk to anyone!",1
"If it were that easy, none of us would have anxiety disorders!",1
"People are more likely to accept a physical illness than a mental illness because major depression, BPD, and other mental conditions affect personality, which can be seen and is most likely unpredictable. In other words, it scares them.",1
"I don't blame ya.   

It hurt so bad for me to deal with depression and anxiety.       ",1
This is quite simple... let me put it this way... what do most people fear the most?  The answer is - their brain shutting down and forced to be dependent.  They fear what they don't understand. I will never understand the stigma.  The brain should be the most focused on- it is vital to running your body.  Are you people with me?,1
Rapid cycling is the worst and really leaves you tired and confused.  I have no answer for you as I still suffer from it and it has never calmed down really even with the meds. I do a lot of DBT with myself and that has helped.,1
and also sometimes it could have something to do with throid condtion on the sucide thoughts and depression maybe get it checked i was having some of the same issues and found out my throid was low but i also have ptsd bipolar anxiety and socail anxieety,1
"So sorry to hear how bad you feel. Acute mood swings are really scary, and lead to confusion and fear. Apart from counselling, have you thought of consulting a neurologist? Just a thought!",1
"I have times where I go through moods very quickly. For me it's most likely related to borderline personality disorder. I do not have bipolar, although I have heard that for some people with bipolar cycling that rapidly isn't unusual.

This being unusual for you, it's probably related to some sort of extra stress going on at the moment.

If you've got a psych, you really need to let them know about this if you haven't already.",1
"Guess what got me out of rapid cycling...as not to sound religious, as I'm not..but I talked to a higher power and expressed all of my moods to that power. I asked for help. I spent most of my day just talking to the higher power, expressing, crying, sharing..it was like a light switch that changed things..I'm actually able to have a job now and work whereas before I was too emotional to work..today I am seen as the reliable one at work..the go to girl. Through talking to something or someone bigger than me..a higher force..whatever you want to call it..not meds..not reading some religious book but honestly just giving all of my fears, hopes and dreams to God, Goddess, whatever..try it, you have nothing to lose. I'm bipolar type 1 and guess what..all my anxiety and instability has disappeared..most of it anyway..there is a cosmic awesome energy force that is able to help you, call on it.",1
"Ok here's my spin
Diet is a major factor in depression and anxiety..
This is an awful truth but unless a decent diet is addressed the body is in a constant state of alert. Either to get rid of toxins parasites or high levels of blood sugar..
Loads of research has been done on the gut brain connection and is well worth the reading.

Doctors are happy to prescribe an instant fix but it never addresses the long term well being of a person
Just the now...
I am not selling anything or trying to argue a point with anyone it's just this.
I have personally suffered anxiety and chronic depression on and off all my life...
I started on a new diet based on no grains and no sugar...
This grew to include night shades and read meat...
 I eat berries and Greek style yogurt for breakfast most days( frozen berries are in supermarkets for cheap) or eggs and salad.
Each day I try to eat one raw meal and one cooked meal....
If you are at all interested please pm and I will explain further...I take no medications at all and I have support in 12 step groups and close friends.... I am so happy to be in control of my diet...I have lost weight and gained my self respect....awesome...my grocery bill is xlnt..
I have helped many people to be free of gut problems and hence lead happier lives...
Probiotics are useless if not addressing a diet...
Peace to all who read this...

anxiety is not knowing what you want in your life,1
"It is so true..lam constantly told to stop worrying about everything  but they have no insight into the powerlessness of anxiety...l guess that's why l work hard using the skills l've been taught and do a ""Workout"" twice a day using my Pacifica app and a great app called Smiling Mind. They give practical helps to give me some empowerment over damm anxiety",1
I hate my meds. We've been trying for years and just cant get it worked out. My bain is just wore out and im tired of it. But i am terrified to go off of them. I've always b÷n medicated. Ugh...,1
I fought against meds for so long. Not really cuz of the stigma but because I get addicted to things very easy and I worried I wouldn't be able to live off them. Then I started to have massive panic attacks several times a day and my husband begged me to please talk to the doctor about meds. So I started zoloft. I got damn lucky zoloft worked for me right away. I went on zoloft mainly because I was trying to get pregnant and it's safe for pregnancy. I was very lucky they worked and make me stable.,1
Christopher L Snead they are scary. It took my 5 years to find the right now meds.  Ow I have no bad side effects. It was worth the trial amd error.,1
Meds scare me I've taken them before and the side effects are terrible,1
Ive tried mmj but it didnt help me at all. It was a strain for insomnia and depression and it helped neither.,1
And this is why cannabis should be legal. Because everyone is on horrible medications right now.,1
buspar has been a godsent for my anxiety. ativan only put me to sleep.,1
I use it during the daytime for anxiety. Doesn't make you sleepy but calms your nerves.,1
I took this while I was pregnant for a very brief amount of time. It gave me serious insomnia and for about 2 hours after every dose I felt like my anxiety was actually worse,1
"My dr put me on escitalopram for my depression and buspirone for my anxiety. From what I've heard buspirone is for anxiety. I would double check with your dr. But other than that, buspirone isn't that great. The only way to break out of anxiety is to challenge yourself to talk to a person who you've never met before a day. Small talk like hi or how your day is going. I usually do this when I go to the store and talk a bit with the cashiers when I'm checking out.",1
I took wellburtin for a little bit. It made me so irritable  ( spelling ). I never took the other one..,1
"What are you on these for? Anxiety and depression? It takes at least 6 weeks to kick in. Still a mood stabilizer like lithium that handles both very well might be the better way to go. Slow release tablets 900mg a day, 3 X 300mg tabs.",1
Very much sounds like anxiety attacks- but would recommend you see your health care professional :-),1
"Anxiety symptoms sweetheart. You sound so much like me.....but I have severe anxiety panic disorder. I don't leave my home.  Go see your doctor and explain everything you said to us.  You are definitely experiencing some anxiety there.  A doctor will talk with you and let you know,  and help you treat it.  Feel better soon,  chin up and see that doctor :)",1
Make a list each day of things you need to get done and check them off. When you wake you can see what's left to do. Just a bit of organization and you'll get the reality check you need to bring down your anxiety.,1
Seems like anxiety symptoms,1
"it sounds like anxiety to me,its the symptoms.",1
I became quickly addicted to benzos after two weeks when I didn't know about their side effects. It took me six months to get off. Be careful with addictive anti anxiety meds. It's probably better that you don't take them in the long run. I used depakote to get off of Klonopin. It worked really well. Completely solved the withdrawal problems I was having.,1
A good Dr will only prescribe benzodiazepines as a last resort and only for short periods of time due to their addictive nature. Most antidepressants are also good for anxiety in long term busperine is also less additive and good for longterm management of anxiety.  Beta blockers can help with physical symptoms. Drugs like valium ativan should be used sparingly.,1
"My doc gives with no problem, she does however restrict to 15 a month. I only use them as my 'rescue' tabs for severe anxiety. I am on 3 anxiety tabs a day which keeps me quite stable.",1

"This seems to be the trend right now. If you're lucky enough to even find a psychiatrist & one that's taking patients, it's very difficult to be taken seriously. In my area, you either got the docs that throw anything at you but mostly the ones who do the bare minimum. I've been relying on herbal supplements like kava kava or valerian root to help my anxiety.",1
"That's a shame Jessica, because if you have a disorder that causes you to need it and are not abusing it, you should be helped. My doctor is a really good listener. I was diagnosed with severe depression and severe anxiety panic disorder. He wanted me on Xanax but because of the junkies Xanax has been removed from Australia. And doctors do NOT give out Xanax but I'm really really bad. So he wants me on increased dosages of Valium. He said it may take up to 5 each day to just calm me down. My doctor cares and listens,  and a good doctor will look at your history, your diagnosis, previous suicide attempts (they look over everything) and look at you today and tell you what you will need. If he/she flat out said no,  that's not very good. If she gave a reason well....... Yeah it's a hard one. Yes certain prescribed drugs are addictive but under the watchful eye of a good doctor and regular visits, and taking them as prescribed for your condition, you are safe,  because the doc can ween you off safely when it's time. So sorry your having a shit time.  Candy",1
Unfortunately lots of doctors are that way because Ativan can be addictive and they do not want us relying on it. I'm supposed to use my techniques I learned at therapy to combat panic attacks and depression.,1
"Is she going to wean you off? Simply not renewing can be very dangerous. Potential side effects of cold turkey are seizures, hallucinations, and psychotic episodes. Lesser side effects can be anxiety, dizziness, increased heart rate, and headaches. If your doctor is forcing you to quit cold turkey, get in to a different psychiatrist immediately.",1
"Rest ,  proper diet and attempting to stay free of stress are key In Recovery and maintaining  a healthy balance",1
Yes. My mother denied my bipolar PTSD and anxiety for years. She has finally accepted it but still questions my medications whenever I see her which is like 1 week out of the year,1
I think fear of the unknown..myths and stigma has a lot to answer for,1
Was on prozac but it was HORRIBLE !!!! LOVE MY SON    NOT PREGNANCY..... ALso b safe with everyone knowing ur issues... my son doesn't live with me bcuz judge said no fixing crazy. Yeah....,1
"I too felt wonderful while pregnant! I chose to stay on low doses of medications. I tried going off but couldn't. All 3 of my kids are healthy. There are stresses wheb pregnant and obviously worse with a baby. When your time is right, you will know it. You don't HAVE to have a baby, if it's not right for you. My anxiety got worse then better. Everyone is different tho. And now I constantly worry about being a good mother and doing the right thing. Good luck sweetie",1
"I have bipolar 1 and chose not to have kids- worried that my moods, irritability you name it would not make me a good mom and did worry about going without meds.  I am 60 now and do not regret my decision.",1
"I am bipolar 2 and i stopped my meds when pregnant. I was happier while pregnant and no mood swings. My psych said no meds were safe while pregnant, i know they say some are but its risk versus benefit my psych said.  After my baby was born my moods were out of control. That was the hardest part. But meds helped and with time my body went back to normal",1
"I have a 2 year old and a 1 month old. I took Buspar for a short period of time during my pregnancy but it caused me severe insomnia (which I had no problem before starting the meds) I was on lamictal when I found out I was pregnant and had to stop treatment. My psych (who is very experienced and well known in the mental medical community) wasn't comfortable with any other options. Said he would try lithium but it wasn't something he practiced so I would have to sign a waiver stating I'm aware of the possibility of complications/defects, so I refused and went without meds. I turned to aromatherapy. Orange is one of my favorite essential oils to help promote good mood. But everyone is different. Both times I became pregnant, it was unplanned, though it happened both times during the spring which is a lower stress period for my cycles",1
"I'm sure he's well aware that he needs to be with his son and handle his finances SMH his post is pretty much saying HE IS STRUGGLING WITH THAT and would like some advice and support seeing that this is what this page is for. Your ignorance on everyone's posts pisses me off lady..... Why you here? To tell ppl to just calm down and shut up?? If things were so simple we'd just.... Do it..... Wouldn't we??  Ugh! Anyway,  to the man who wrote this post. Fonzie, It truly must be hard being a father and struggling to provide.  The weight of the world hey?  I'm so sorry your going through this.  I'm sure you are trying your best. Sometimes the government can help in financial situations depending what country you live. Seeing your doctor may help you,  some light medication and maybe some therapy mate. Sounds like a tough time for you. And I hope your relationship issues can be resolved. It's hard but never give up.",1
Get on some stabilizer meds for anxiety. You have to be with your son and handle finances.,1
"It took a lot of time to try to teach my boyfriend about BPD.  After my last stay in the hospital, things have been getting better and we have begun to communicate in ways that are helping! There are struggles, but we manage",1
"I was diagnosed with bipolar, anxiety and depression before getting pregnant with my second child. Pregnancy I took my lamictal and other meds and my psychiatrist said it was fine. Being a mom with these things has its ups and downs and good days and bad days like most things however a good strong support system and the right meds make it possible and worth it. Good luck!",1
Total balls statement! Wish I could decide not to let my anxiety fuck my life up sometimes!,1
This is offensive to people who already struggle with self-defeating thoughts. This contributes to the STIGMA you say you are trying to fight.,1
"Recovery isn't always a choice.
Otherwise we'd be able to instantly pull ourselves out of depressive states or anxiety attacks or panic attacks.",1
Why aren't you on an atypical anti psychotic at night to rest? Plus mood stabilizers to control anxiety and depression and benzodiazapines for spot relief.,1
Counselor...my gp doesn't handle any of this.  I asked for anxiety meds and they don't want to do it till the Lamictal starts doing its job but it's not doing anything and my breakdowns are getting worse.  I don't know why they aren't helping me.  I am making my next prescriber appt next week and gonna keep trying,1
"I take 200mg lamictal in the morning along with 1mg estradiol. 300mg ozcarbazepine and 2mg of tenex at night. I still have my anxiety and depression swings so they added lorazepam/tenex 0.5mg double if I need for my outbreaks. Been on this cocktail for 2 yrs but still have my breakdowns. It does take time for your meds to stabilize you but sounds like you need to keep on your anxiety meds! Keep explaining to them, have them read your journals. Finding a doctor/therapist is hard but finding one that can relate to you is so important for you. I call mine .. my best friend   . Please hang in there and keep plugging along. You can win this battle. I'm here (not an expert) but have 50 yrs of experience battling this disorder. Talk to them, ask them how can I get you to listen to me!",1
"I take 600mg lithium 150mg lamotrigine which is fairly new also 175mg Quitiapine 10 - 15 mg Diazepam and 7mg zoplicone a sleeping tablet. I take them all at night and when I take them I almost instantly feel soo dizzy and if I don't lie down immediately I'm staggering about the place. Yet I'm having real difficulty sleeping. I think it's got something to do with lamotrigine but since my psychiatrist left after 9 years. All I get is locums and they don't seem to listen and just up lamotrigine and quitiapine I don't think I'm on the right meds but they don't really listen and I'm scared to rock the boat incase they give me something that will increase my weight. So I'm in a catch 22 as I've not been in hospital,for two years and don't want to go back. But my mood is more down than up. X",1
The lamictal is a good long term preventative for depression but not so good short term- have you tried a mood stabilizer like tegretol or lithium or do you have just depression?  Due to recent law changes prescriptions for potentially addictive drugs like sleep meds and anxiety meds now are strictly controlled and they just do not give as many of them.  Maybe you need an antidepressant as well.,1
That is horrible.  I'm sorry to hear that,1
They told me this was a mood stabilizer...I told her I need something for in the moment breakdowns and she said let's get this up to a good dosage first and see if you need something after that...I am scared and not very authoritive,1
this is one of those platitudes I hate and wish people would stop using.  time and love doesn't always make things better.  And when they don't get better it makes the person that was already struggling feel like they must be doing something wrong or aren't good enough to figure it all out.  Empty platitudes make things worse.,1
I'm horrible with meds. I don't take them or I take to many.,1
I have a lot of meltdowns...uncontrolled crying...they just look at me like im stupid. ..its things i CANT control ...could be something little...music..thinking...ect....im in my room 99 % of the day...i get depressed ...i cant get it through their head that its nothing i ever wanted in my life...total opposite of my old self...they think its a joke....its no joke!,1
I've had a couple of them. It is an all consuming feeling of fright. I thank God I haven't had any in forever it seems.,1
Its a living hell going through panic attact thay just come on with no warning if you ant had one then you dont know wot these people go through as i do as ive said its s living hell,1
They are horrible :'(,1
A panic attack can only be understood by those who have had one. Frightening to say the least. The fear of dieing can be very real,1
There is know way to describe the terror you feel when your having a full blown panic attack unless you've had one.,1
Everyday struggles for those of us that have mental health problems.,1
"I can agree that a situation or a set of experiences is so jacked up that doing anything 'feels' like like we are putting band aids on cancer. I really do get this, I've been plagued by this. I often wished that depression would stop my heart and the lights would go out one last time. The only resolution for this new year was go to war with my diagnosis. No real choice. Alone last Christmas Day and felt cornered by the black, snarling dogs of major depressive disorder. I guess I snapped. If I was going to take some punches, I was certainly going to throw some from here on out. It started with a written plan for the rest of my life. Step 1, get out that lumpy bed and wash myself. That was a victory for me. Any progress I have made this year boils down to a three step process. Acceptance of the naked truth that the world is the way I find it. Careful choices about what I love to see happen. Taking action amidst great friction and discomfort. I'm actually fighting now after years of being dormant.",1
scary,1
"I totally understand. I'm 41 and this has just taken over my life much worse in the last 2 yrs. I have all these same problems in my life. I was voted ""Most Likely to Succeed"" by my graduating class & used to excel at everything! It's horrible now that if I shower, I've accomplished something. I don't have the answer; just want you to know you're not alone. I'm currently home from work Bcuz stress led me to getting mono.   ",1
Might I suggest vippasanna meditation or at the very least practicing mindfulness? It helps against panic attacks.,1
"Right now I am working PT but my job is seasonal for Jackson Hewitt. As soon as tax season ends, my job ends and I have to find something new.  It's going to be hard trying to find something that's going to work with me. The place I go for therapy is 30 minutes away from where I live so I barely have time to do anything but come home for a bit, take care of my dogs and leave for work. 
After my first session (which was Monday) I was so upset and raw I ended up having a panic attack and I missed my shift.",1
I was put back on xanax for the anxiety and panic attacks and Latuda for bipolar. My boss even took me to my initial appointment to see what therapy I needed. She knew I how intense it was going to be but was still upset about me missing work. I'm trying to stick it out until April 18th and I've applied for disability yesterday. I'm just finding it hard to function after each session and have no idea how to clear my head without breaking down in public while working when all I want to do is go to bed.,1
"You'll get through it. It'll take some time but you'll get through it. It's not meant to be easy. Talk to your psych and see if he/she can give you anything for the panic attacks. Each session gets ""easier"" as you work through things. And talk to  your boss and let him know what you're dealing with. When I finished my last in-patient time and had to go to PHP I came home the same way you described and it was hell. And that was seven days a week so no breaks at all. It sucked. But it got easier as time went on. (Not trying to compare my situation to yours, just trying to say I know where you're coming from.)",1
"I have SSDI for bipolar I that was diagnosed 25 years ago. I have had multiple hospital stays, 5150s, 5250,s. Last time I was manic I got arrested twice for suspicion of being on meth. They threw me in jail instead of taking me to mental health. Dumb ass cops but I digress. I've also had a lot of health problems. I guess it was just the combination of everything that got me approved on the first try. That is the exception and not the rule though. Most people get denied 3 times and end up having to go to court. It's a long haul.",1
"BP2, GAD, PTSD, Insomnia, panic disorder, Agoraphobia,  recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's.   After working 24 years, haven't worked the past three. No disability.",1
"I'm 36 years old and my family literally has to lock me in sometimes because my BPD is flared. The back, privacy fence is screwed shut and the front gate can be locked. I don't have a key. I'm very irrational when I'm cycling. There is no way I could work. I'm trying for disability",1
Work might be triggerring your depression/ anxiety at the moment meaning you might need to go on sick leave for awhile and work on yourself. I don't think not working will benefit you in the long run I dont know what you do but thinking about another job if it is the job you are doing that is specifically causing issues. I don't know where you are from I'm in UK and I work and get a certain amount of paid sick leave however the paid by my work but I was of over a year from July 2015 to August 2016 and received benefit as I was on half pay and then no pay for months but benefit a lot less than my pay.  Its unlikely you would be put on permanent disability benefit which is sounds like your suggesting you would need to be seriously ill in hospital and unable to do anything for yourself or even talk to irger people to not be able to work. I have BPD BP2 as well as anxiety and depression and i also have physical long term health conditions as there are times as I've mentioned when i am unable to work and on sick leave but when things improve I am able to return and my work is supportive. You also need to be actively and on continuous treatment by a Dr and medication who you can show and who will sat why you cannot work.,1
"I received approval for bipolar and anxiety.  I read the Social Security Blue Book, chapter 12 and filled out my paperwork based on my documented medical problems.",1
I have BP with mania don't know if that's one or two. Also other things ptsd. Fibromialga anxiety. An I have disability,1
"Yes!! Everyones case is different,,my anxiety ,bipolar 1,came my my eplipsey surgery in 1998,,i had 2 apply in 2014...and got it within 3months on my own with my doctors and family's  support,,i had 2 try,,i do have 2 pay pills...and live...",1
"I've talked about this before. It is all about your history and what you can show them. You must have clear documentation. I went with a very good and kind lawyer who reviewed my case and helped me every step of the way. You must fill out your initial application on line and answer the questions in a specific way or you will be rejected automatically. Then you must have documentation from every doctor and hospital that has ever treated you. As well as those therapists you have seen. Then you will also have to fill out a questionnaire about yourself that you must be very honest and open about. It is brutal. Then a family member or spouse must also answer concerns. Mine was my sisters and nearly broke me to read it. But it was the truth. 

So, basically you must have all your ducks in a row. I am coming up on my 7 year review  in 2019. I don't even know if I will still have benefits. But I do know that I need to start getting prepared now. And it scares the shit out of me! 

Some of you think it would be better to ""stick it out"" and not be at home. But my former employer did not understand my frequent need to be away from work. And really, they need you there and count on you, as well as your fellow workers, to be there. It is not a commitment that I can give a company that I will be able to work full or even part time, because I don't know when my symptoms will smack me down. Or when a manic or depressive cycle begins because mine come in rapid cycles. It is terrifying for me when I don't recognize it happening to stop the process.  And what will happen if an employer sees this?? I had a horrible experience in my last job where my supervisor was afraid of me and refused to meet alone with me!?! All because of her misconceptions of BPD!

So think long and hard before you begin the process of applying for SSDI.  It is not as easy as you think",1
this year the rules are changing so most people will no longer be awarded money for depression and anxiety you have to be very very bad now and be receiving a lot of treatment and say lost ur kids for not being able to care for them then u will be able to get it otherwise 90% are going to loose benefits best thing u can do it go get help like therapy trust me if u leave work u will feel worse off as their is nothing occupying ur mind its very isolating being at home speak to the wellbeing clinic they are wonderful its all a free service and they can do so much to help so u can feel back in control again its a hard road but u have to just keep going a step at a time i wish u all the best u don't need a dr btw to see wellbeing u can refute urself which is wonderful x,1
I'd avoid this. I highly doubt you will be better off.  The government is also making it more difficult.   Maybe consider FMLA to get therapy and assistance with coping. It is very hard to get SSI.,1
Bp1/panic disorder/ PTSD. I got ssi my first try at the age of 28. I think my case maybe a little different because I was diagnosed at 17 with hospitals stays in between the time I got on ssi. Medical paperwork is very important for your case.,1
I got disability and SSI for depression/anxiety. But I had to hire a lawyer to win my case. I was denied three times which I'm told is common in the process.,1

If they can prove that you can't work due to your illnesses then you will be ok but know that it is a long process. You'll get denied several times off the bat, I would recommend you find a good attorney who won't charge you unless you win. They won't take your case if they don't think you will get it. Best of luck to you.",1

"Substance abuse is often associated with mood disorders and I have found in my own life that addiction is a serious battle: i can become addicted to anything it seems not just the usual drugs.

You are amazing and remember that just because you relapsed doesnt mean you failed just keep trying to quite! Thats what is important.",1
I don't think it is a good thing to bring religion on this page as it is too contentious. I can't say what I really think as it would upset people,1
I hate to say it but most teenagers are made to do a lot of housework. It's just a part of growing up. You need to talk to your parents about seeing a dr. Self diagnosing is never a good idea. Mental health is a complex illness and there are many factors that go into a diagnosis. Do you have s school counsellor that you can speak to? I know you must feel pretty bad now but your lack of friends most likely wouldn't be because you are too ugly or too fat. It might be how you feel but anxiety and illnesses like depression can make you believe things that aren't true. Have your old friends said that? If they did then be grateful they aren't in your life anymore. I really strongly suggest you speak with your parent about seeing a doctor who can refer you to a psychiatrist for evaluation and a therapist to give you some tools to help you cope. If you like to research try cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness. These are 2 approaches used in the mental health space and can really help.,1
"Ah I remember doing these exact things sadly, except the working part and had to go between only two doctors and feeling somewhat of a relief after the sessions, from what i can assume perhaps you should take your prescribed medication that your doctor has given you, before work. I am diagnosed as a bi polar psychotic and have real bad anxiety as well, i take lorazepam and risperidal.",1
I take Latuda at night because it makes me sleepy and xanax throughout the day for anxiety.,1
Dealing with your worst fears and memories is draining. Maybe your therapist can spend the last 30 min of your sessions teaching you techniques to calm yourself down and change mental gears. ❤,1
I'm always afraid of this.,1

"I am the mother of two adult children. Emma Peetz who has given you wise counsel in her reply is one. Until tecently the mental illness of my youngest daughter was so debilitating I was her carer for far too many years. Fortunately Emma's bipolar isnt so severe she has ever needed a carer and works and support s herself and cares for her son who is now a teenager. I am an advocate for carers and mental illness in Sydney and recently addressed a conference on the subjects. I will wuote you a couple of relevannt parts of what I had to say as it may help you
""Medication can usually quickly relieve physical suffering  but relieving the suffering of mental illness can take years""
During that time she was hospitalized many times and various medications were tried by caring and wonderful clinicians. THE CURRENT MEDICATIONS HAVE WORKED and at 31 she can actually look forward to a fulfilling life and is now an advocate for the mentally ill.
I wrote her a poem which said in part
""She sank to the depths of despair as her soul surrendered to the gods, the demons and the shadow people that lived in the fires of her wounded mind"". 
I can only encourage you to follow the advice of expert clinicians as I was able to finish the poem for my daughter with:
""Hercgentle spirit endured, strong enough to come into her light once more,whe but still tremlinng with fear for she had seen the dark side of the mind "".
There was an Australian poet who suffered from your illness who also wrote a poem which finishes:
""AND THE WORLD MY GIRL IS A GOOD WORLD AFTER ALL"".Am sure you too can come to that place but it may take many wise minds and no doubt the right meds for you to get to that place.",1
understand but still struggle worth this daily,1
"Do you know what yourself really is? Because with bipolar on or off meds a simple reaction can leave you wondering what's me and what's my disease. You do have a child to think of and stabilization of your mood swings while dealing with some side effects is potentially best for the whole family. I'm not prescribing zombie doses - good mood stabilizers don't do that and they protect you from the highs and lows. Racing thought can be addressed with an atypical anti psychotic such as ziprasidone at bedtime, and will help with these overwhelming feelings you're having too in your brain. It's all about chemical imbalances in the brain that need to be augmented. Good luck sweetie!",1

"Music! That's always been something that I love. So, when I am getting all up in my head, that's where I turn. I've had a hard time for 3 years now with PTSD, depression among other things. This evil little thing can get into our minds and make us think we can do anything, all we can do is isolate (which I do too, Btw), think about why and what is wrong with us. We all have people who love us. I have 2 little boys who need their mom more now than ever. I had to be put on something to keep my mind from racing. That is always my problem. I've set with ear buds in my ears and told myself "" You know Courtney, tomorrow just do 1 more thing different, for your good and so that's what I have been doing for a year. Everyday do 1 thing different or the way I think I should do it and haven't been, or do something right,  do something to better anything in my life. And it has helped. I'm not gonna say I'm 100% better because I'm not. I still have horrible days, but I'll tell you this and I do not like hearing it either and it makes me very mad, but if a med doesn't work, go to your doc and get another one. I did that a year ago and had a nervous breakdown and it has been the darkest hole I've had to pull myself out of. It's been the worst. Maybe find a new doc or go to a homeopathic doc. They are great. Just be careful about your meds and know that you aren't alone. All my prayers and thoughts for you. You R Not Alone",1

I don't know you personally, but I know you are a precious son of God that Christ has experienced all the pains and fears that you have felt. I have a difficult time accepting Christ's love for me, but it's easy for me to know and bear witness of His love for others. Never, never, never give up!!!",1
Difficulty sleeping makes dealing with life overwhelming. Connect with a dr who can refer you to a psychiatrist and should send you for therapy. I believe medication is only part of the solution. In the mean time do some research for cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness. Mindfulness is great for anxiety and wonderful for racing thoughts when trying to get to sleep. There are a lot of resources in the net but of course a face to face consultation is always better.,1

I do the exact same thing. I have less than half an hour to get dressed and here I sit. I'll not shower because I'll have some irrational fear of the world ending while I am naked. I have my so write a list for me and it helps hold me accountable if I think I am doing it for someone else,1
You are among friends! I too struggle to take a shower and am Bipolar 2. And some other crap thrown in. Today I took my shower before noon and went with my husband to Target without having a panic attack! Victory is mine!!,1
Just to let you know that you can message me anytime..your not alone on this page..and I'm so sorry to hear about you cancer but so glad your getting. Better..I'm bipolar also and have just over the last 9 months been diagnosed..and yeah your right everything screams and nobody just doesn't seem to notice at time and I live in a family of 5 my partner and 3 children..and it's not nice for me when they just tell me to shut up and take my medication..it's one of the worse things they can say cos at that moment my mind then starts telling me well they must be against me and it can spiral out of control..it's a terrifying thing so I can imagine your pain when you don't have anyone to turn too..all I can say is please try and be strong and keep going and remember through every dark night there is a brighter day..also just pm I really don't mind..Keep your head up xxxx,1
I think I know how you feel. You don't want to worry your mom but you need some support. That's what these pages are for. There are lots of fellow sufferers out there that can relate to your situation. I know you like to rely on your mom but from what you've said she seems to have enough worries of her own at the moment. Do you have any self help techniques that you can practice? Do you meditate? Also wondering if you have a good therapist. I've been struggling badly myself but I'm doing OK lately. I hope you can find a way through your difficulties.,1
"I have read this 11 times and and I (I am very sorry if I offend you in any way )see  you have just typed everything about me I am looking at my life in this text as if I was a mirror I am feeling a bit overwhelmed, again I am sorry if I offend you ,I find this hard to explain to anyone ,it comes out of my mouth the wrong way and then I feel stupid and go lock myself away or I explode and shout and scream for the silliest reason ,the only thing is I haven't hurt my self but if I do have pain I let it get really bad as I feel comfort in it ,I but at times I feel I am just waiting to die ,I am only 52 I don't know where to turn or what to do I am so confused ,I hope you can find the help you need and may your god bless you and your family with love health wealth and happiness",1
"Meds are an important part of your well being. But one of three....the other two are 1: therapy, and 2: a positive influencer in your life. Both are a challenge to find. Good docs for the meds and good therapists for your behaviors/thinking are too few and many times overwhelmed. Yet they are essential. As for the influencer.....think of them as a cheerleader, or a mentor. Someone whom both encourages and assists you with good things in your life. Daily if possible. Look me up on fb if you think I could be of help.",1
Don't stop your meds. Unfortunately they are not a cure. They will help you feel better for a while and then your mood can shift. You may need a med change but therapy like DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) may be really useful. Learning to manage your mood changes can be really helpful and make them less frightening. Talk to your doctor. I hope all goes well.,1
"I don't know what med or meds you're on. I hope a good mood stabilizer like lithium at a dose like 900mg. Talk to your doctor about anti psychotics at night to rest your brain and give you regular sleep, and both these types of drugs help with anxiety.",1
"A little break in life for me was 4 years of isolation, very bad, I am bipolar withe anxiety and PTSD and on top of that I'm an alcoholic in recovery",1
"Sure. As most everyone has said, find what works for you. I watch TV, obviously spend time checking FB out, and take naps as needed.  Some of the naps are from physical exertion, but some are from the overwhelming emotional exertion that comes over me.   ",1
Even if u need to take 2 days off work- mental illness is as serious as physical illness. If you're feeling unwell that's a sick day too and u don't need to be specific about why u call in sick. If u don't rest and your anxiety spirals way out of control u may end up hospitalized and or missing a lot more work,1
Taking a break is important. Also when you feel up to it research mindfulness. It has been a godsend for me dealing with anxiety. It takes practice but it is well worth it.,1
"Nothing wrong with that at all if it feels right for you at the time go for it. I've done it myself before admittedly not In bed but I've crashed out on the settee for a day, I echo what Bryan said be careful about making sure it doesn't take over your life I think it could end up feeding the anxiety if it becomes a regular thing but for an odd occasion nothing wrong with it in my opinion hope this helps u",1
Simonchini was found guilty of manslaughter back in 2006 and jailed. He killed 9 of his patients by injecting baking soda into them. Worth a try? No thanks!,1
"Please contact SADAG (south African depression and anxiety group) they have a website, and toll-free hotline specifically for bipolar patients. They have a wealth of information and will be able to assist you❤",1

"Lamictal is my miracle med.Only took me 26 years to find the right med.This doesn't make you gain weight.I be taken. Buspar for anxiety,as well as hydroxizin e for anxiety which is a bonus.You take it as needed.Prozasin for Ptsd nightmare and sleep works great.",1
"I take Wellbutrin, topamax, and buspar (antidepressant, antidepressant, anti anxiety). None have caused weight gain, the first two can even cause weight loss for some people.",1
