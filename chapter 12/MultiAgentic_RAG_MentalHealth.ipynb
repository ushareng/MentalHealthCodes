        "The notebook implements a system for answering user queries related to mental health. It utilizes a combination of a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) knowledge base and internet search (specifically Wikipedia) to provide relevant information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Workflow**:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Installation**: Installs necessary libraries like langchain, tiktoken, openai, faiss-cpu, wikipedia, bs4, and requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Initialization**: Sets up the OpenAI API key, loads pre-defined FAQs, creates a vector store for semantic search using FAISS, and initializes the language model (LLM) with gpt-4.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Routing**: A route_query function determines whether the user query should be addressed by the FAQ knowledge base or an internet search based on the query's content.\n",
        "\n",
        "**FAQ Agent**: The faq_lookup function searches the FAQ knowledge base for the most similar question to the user's query and returns the corresponding answer if a match is found above a certain threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Search Agent**: If the routing agent directs the query to an internet search, the internet_search_wiki function queries Wikipedia for relevant articles. It extracts snippets from the top articles and uses the LLM to summarize the information, providing citations. If no Wikipedia results are found, it falls back to a simple Google WebView scrape.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Orchestrator**: The answer_query function orchestrates the entire process by first routing the query, then invoking either the FAQ or search agent based on the route, and finally returning the answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example Usage**: The notebook includes example queries demonstrating how to use the system to answer questions about anxiety attacks and depression.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, the notebook provides a basic framework for a mental health chatbot that can leverage both pre-defined knowledge and internet search to address user inquiries."

            "Major depressive disorder (MDD), also known as clinical depression, is a significant mental health condition characterized by persistent low mood, low self-esteem, and a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that are typically enjoyable [1]. It affects a substantial portion of the population, with onset most common in a person's 20s and affecting females more frequently than males [1]. The disorder is diagnosed through reported experiences and behaviors, as there are no laboratory tests for MDD, although tests may be conducted to exclude other conditions [1]. \n",

            "Treatment often involves psychotherapy and antidepressant medications, though the effectiveness of these medications can be controversial. In severe cases, hospitalization or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be necessary [1]. The causes of MDD are complex, involving genetic, environmental, and psychological factors, with a notable genetic component [1]. Depression impacts personal and professional life, affecting sleep, eating habits, and overall health [1].\n",
            "\n",
            "Depression, more broadly, affects about 3.5% of the global population, or approximately 280 million people worldwide as of 2020 [3]. It is characterized by low mood, aversion to activity, and can lead to symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts [3]. It can be a symptom of mood disorders like MDD, bipolar disorder, and dysthymia, or a reaction to life events or physical illnesses [3].\n",
            "\n",
            "In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the potential of psychedelics to treat depression. Michael Pollan's book, \"How to Change Your Mind,\" explores the history and resurgence of psychedelic research, suggesting these substances might offer insights into consciousness and mental health treatment [2]. This area of research is gaining attention for its potential to provide alternative treatment options for depression and other mental health conditions [2]. \n",
