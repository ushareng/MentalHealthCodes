I\\u2019ve been battling with chronic stress for about 3 weeks now. I want to say the cause of it is my job. It\\u2019s the only thing that makes sense. Due to the pandemic, I\\u2019ve had 4 different positions within the past 3 months. My regular position that I held before this all this happened was awesome. I actually loved my job and looked forward to work each morning. When everything shut down back in March, until about the middle of May, I was moved to two other positions that we still pretty relaxed, the hours just kind of sucked. But now this new role that I\\u2019ve been in for about a month is killing me. It\\u2019s very stressful, the days are long, it seems like a constant race against the clock, the people I deal with can be a pain which adds more stress. I keep telling myself it\\u2019s only temporary and hopefully I\\u2019ll be able to get my old job as things start to normalize more. But for the past 3 weeks my symptoms have included Weighted chest (most prominent symptom) Lightheadedness/Dizziness Tightness in neck and shoulders Lower back pain Anxiety that won\\u2019t go away Rapid heartbeat Acid reflux/heartburn Stomach issues Fatigue I have tired to change my diet to start eating a bit healthier. I\\u2019ve also been trying breathing exercises and doing stretching in the evenings when I get home from work. It seems to help a little. I also plan on getting back to the gym, because I know exercise will help out as well. I\\u2019m just wondering if this is something that will eventually go away or am I in it for the long haul? I\\u2019ve felt this way once before, about a month before my daughter was born. But it completely went away right after she was born. Not kidding. Maybe big life changes are my trigger? But I didn\\u2019t feel this way when I got married or bought a house or anything like that. Any insight or advice to manage this is greatly appreciated!!\",\n          \"We only see those who get better Aka survivorship bias.

            "Envy to other is swallowing me Im from developingcountry, Indonesia , and for now i temporary work overseas for 3 years contract, it's a hard labor job, and stressful. Next year my contract is finish. But, during my stay here, because of job, and my social life, my depression got worse, and i envy this developed country. Why this country is so good. I can afford anything i want here. Why can't we just have equality in currency exchange? I I need to work 15-20 years in big company in jakarta(our capital city) , just to get equal amount of saving money from what i got from 3 years working here. Yes, that's right, it's saving money, not spending money. And yes, im going to be a rich person in such young age If I think about it, this society is sick, the gap of un equality beetwen developing vs developed country, or the poor vs the rich is too big right now. Sorry if i look like an evil person , but because of this,I almost wish for war to happen, or this world to end, and got reseted. So everyone can have another chance to gain equality, the poor can finally have a chance to have a better life. Because if this world order stay this way, it will eventually collapse on itself. Soon.\n"
