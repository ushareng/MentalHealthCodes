So for this particular task we will make use of the Roberta Classifier pipeline which we will just load and train it using our reddit thread dataset to make our predictions.\n"

I\\u2019ve been battling with chronic stress for about 3 weeks now. I want to say the cause of it is my job. It\\u2019s the only thing that makes sense. Due to the pandemic, I\\u2019ve had 4 different positions within the past 3 months. My regular position that I held before this all this happened was awesome. I actually loved my job and looked forward to work each morning. When everything shut down back in March, until about the middle of May, I was moved to two other positions that we still pretty relaxed, the hours just kind of sucked. But now this new role that I\\u2019ve been in for about a month is killing me. It\\u2019s very stressful, the days are long, it seems like a constant race against the clock, the people I deal with can be a pain which adds more stress. I keep telling myself it\\u2019s only temporary and hopefully I\\u2019ll be able to get my old job as things start to normalize more. But for the past 3 weeks my symptoms have included Weighted chest (most prominent symptom) Lightheadedness/Dizziness Tightness in neck and shoulders Lower back pain Anxiety that won\\u2019t go away Rapid heartbeat Acid reflux/heartburn Stomach issues Fatigue I have tired to change my diet to start eating a bit healthier. I\\u2019ve also been trying breathing exercises and doing stretching in the evenings when I get home from work. It seems to help a little. I also plan on getting back to the gym, because I know exercise will help out as well. I\\u2019m just wondering if this is something that will eventually go away or am I in it for the long haul? I\\u2019ve felt this way once before, about a month before my daughter was born. But it completely went away right after she was born. Not kidding. Maybe big life changes are my trigger? But I didn\\u2019t feel this way when I got married or bought a house or anything like that. Any insight or advice to manage this is greatly appreciated!!\",\n          \"We only see those who get better Aka survivorship bias.

            "Is there a light at the end of the tunnel? I’ve been battling with chronic stress for about 3 weeks now. I want to say the cause of it is my job. It’s the only thing that makes sense. Due to the pandemic, I’ve had 4 different positions within the past 3 months. My regular position that I held before this all this happened was awesome. I actually loved my job and looked forward to work each morning. When everything shut down back in March, until about the middle of May, I was moved to two other positions that we still pretty relaxed, the hours just kind of sucked. But now this new role that I’ve been in for about a month is killing me. It’s very stressful, the days are long, it seems like a constant race against the clock, the people I deal with can be a pain which adds more stress. I keep telling myself it’s only temporary and hopefully I’ll be able to get my old job as things start to normalize more. But for the past 3 weeks my symptoms have included Weighted chest (most prominent symptom) Lightheadedness/Dizziness Tightness in neck and shoulders Lower back pain Anxiety that won’t go away Rapid heartbeat Acid reflux/heartburn Stomach issues Fatigue I have tired to change my diet to start eating a bit healthier. I’ve also been trying breathing exercises and doing stretching in the evenings when I get home from work. It seems to help a little. I also plan on getting back to the gym, because I know exercise will help out as well. I’m just wondering if this is something that will eventually go away or am I in it for the long haul? I’ve felt this way once before, about a month before my daughter was born. But it completely went away right after she was born. Not kidding. Maybe big life changes are my trigger? But I didn’t feel this way when I got married or bought a house or anything like that. Any insight or advice to manage this is greatly appreciated!!\n"
