As of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide. I have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe I'll come back. I know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? What do I do and how am I supposed to handle her death on my hands? I still love my wife but I cannot deal with getting cheated on again and constantly feeling insecure. I'm worried today may be the day she does it and I hope so much it doesn't happen.\", '', \"Am I weird I don't get affected by compliments if it's coming from someone I know irl but I feel really good when internet strangers do it\", 'Finally 2020 is almost over...

That was probably the only time in my life I have ever actually been legitimately happy.  I was finally over Starr, thanks to the help from Maren.

If I could go back in time and re-play those four months over and over again, I would without hesitation.  That was the best time of my life.  I didn’t have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control.  I didn’t have to feel like I had to hold all of my feelings inside.  I could share them with Maren, and she was incredibly receptive.  I didn’t have to lie about who I was, or leave details out.  Maren made me feel like I was a good person.  I told her about my past, and she seemed genuinely concerned for me.  She tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things I have been told about myself.  She told me that I was attractive, something I had never been told before, not even by Starr, who I was together with for ten years.  I was happy with who I was at that time.  Prior to that I had never willingly taken a picture of myself.  But with her, we would send each other snapchat pictures, and she made me feel like I wasn’t the hideous person that I thought myself to be.

I long for them to return, but I know that that will never happen.  The same thing has happened with many people before, though none to that extreme.  They are fine with me when we first start talking, and eventually they realise how high-maintenance and fucked up I am.  That causes them to drift away, until eventually we stop talking altogether, or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives.  That was the case with Starr.  The night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me.  In the morning, she told me it was over and a few weeks later told me to never talk to her again.  After ten years of being together, she ended it on a whim, and caused me to lose not only my significant other, but also my best friend.  The same thing is happening with Maren.  I am driving her away, and eventually I will not have a best friend again.  I will be completely alone.  The last time I was completely alone, right after Starr broke up with me, I didn’t leave my room for two weeks.  I didn’t eat a single thing in those two weeks.  I laid there in bed, staring at my ceiling in the darkness, constantly in tears, trying to realise where I had gone wrong.  I have never cried so much in my life.  I have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life, but at that moment I could not contain them any longer.

I sent her a message with no expectations whatsoever, I was prepared to either be completely ignored, or told to go away.  That didn’t happen though.  We had a wonderful conversation, reminiscing about our childhood.  I don’t remember how the subject got changed to me talking about Starr, but I told her everything, and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it.  She stayed up with me until the morning, just talking with me on Facebook.  I was in tears for most of that conversation, partly because I was still upset about the breakup, but also because I couldn’t believe that someone actually cared.  Especially someone I hadn’t talked to in over a decade.  When we started to get close, and revealed our feelings for one another, we joked about how us reconnecting was a “red string of fate.”  I don’t believe in fate, but I also don’t think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment, when I felt like I had nothing left.  The problem lies in the fact that I will never be able to replicate that with anyone else.  I am incredibly socially awkward; I cannot make new friends at all.  In person I just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety.  Online, I just have nothing to say.  I am a boring person.  I have tried to make new friends on various subreddits, /r/r4r, /r/kikpals and the like.  I have talked to a few people who seemed nice, but none of them developed into an actual friendship.

She has made me realise that I am the problem, that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve.  She joined me in blaming Starr for the dissolution of our relationship, but I see now that it was never her fault.  I am just completely unlovable.  I can never have more than one true friend.  I believe this stems from the fact that growing up, I had very few friends, and when I tried to expand and make new friends I got burned very badly, every time.  Because of this, I latch on to the one friend I have.  I suffocate them.  I bother them until they cannot stand it any more, and leave me.

Every time I ask her to do something and she says no, I get a sinking feeling.  Mainly because in the four months that I was happy, we did everything together.  Any time I asked if she wanted to do something, she was happy to hang out with me.  She was happy to talk to me nearly every moment she was awake.

I felt completely at ease when talking with her.  I’ve told her things that no one else in the world knows about me, and she made me feel like she actually cared about them- that she cared about me.  We shared many intimate moments that I would never dare have with anyone else.  We talked about getting together, being with each other, devising crazy scenarios with how to be together.  We talked all the time, nothing could keep us apart.  Except for Ty.  She helped me through all of the problems I was facing related to my depression over the break-up with Starr.

I’m really scared, im a coward, and honestly would rather be dead than try fix this mess. Mess is putting it lightly though. If my life was a large puzzle, it’d be like just throwing the entire thing in a fire of shame. I’m thinking about just cutting an artery, but idt I’d have the stomach for that, but I’ll figure something out. I hear it takes a while to bleed out, If you don’t hit an artery, so people are usually discovered and saved. Fortunately, I live alone in a dorm room and no one ever visits so I have a lot of time. I wrote a note in class addressed to my girlfriend. Looking back at it, it’s kinda all over the place, but I don’t feel like fixing it. I hear if you slit your arm it can cause permanent damage if you fuck up, so I got some medical stuff just in case I wake up and decide not to try again right after. I guess I’m writing this here to make sure people know. I don’t have a history of depression, and haven’t really shown any obvious reasons for something to think I’d ever kill myself. I feel a certain sense of control and calmness and I’m actually looking forward to the time I have to make the decision. If I decide to go through with it, I’ll let you guys know.

I‚Äôve been quiet for so long and I‚Äôm too scared to come out to my family about these feelings. About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things I‚Äôve done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little I‚Äôve experienced in life? Only time I‚Äôve revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful. They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt OD(overdose from pills) and attempt hanging. All that happened was a blackout from the pills and I never went through with the noose because I‚Äôm still so afraid. During my first therapy I was diagnosed with severe depression, social anxiety, and a eating disorder.\n",

As absolutely idiotic as it sounds (and she’s assured me that it is,) talking to her was the one thing I looked forward to every day.  It was the one thing that kept me going; knowing that some time throughout the day I would be able to talk to her, even if only briefly before we went to sleep.\n",

But most of all, she made me feel loved.  Never before have I ever been able to open up to someone so completely.  I felt completely at ease when talking with her.  I’ve told her things that no one else in the world knows about me, and she made me feel like she actually cared about them- that she cared about me.  We shared many intimate moments that I would never dare have with anyone else.  We talked about getting together, being with each other, devising crazy scenarios with how to be together.  We talked all the time, nothing could keep us apart.  Except for Ty.  She helped me through all of the problems I was facing related to my depression over the break-up with Starr.  She talked to me whenever I needed her, and she always made me feel better about it.  She was my shining star in a pitch-black sky.  None of this is any longer, though.\n",

None of it is intentional, but it happens nonetheless.  When we first started talking again, I told her about my clingy tendencies and she said she was okay with that.  I suppose she thought I was over-exaggerating, but I wasn’t.  I need to have interaction in my life.  I know it is not fair to the people around me, and I know that it is not what they want, but I cannot be alone in my own thoughts all the time.  My thoughts are extremely self-destructive.  I need someone to spend time with, someone to talk to to get away from my thoughts.\n",
        "\n",
        "For about four months I was legitimately happy.  That was probably the only time in my life I have ever actually been legitimately happy.  I was finally over Starr, thanks to the help from Maren.  I had no stress at all, things were actually looking up, even my migraines were becoming few and far between.  I was in love, and I felt loved.  If I could go back in time and re-play those four months over and over again, I would without hesitation.  That was the best time of my life.  I didn’t have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control.  I didn’t have to feel like I had to hold all of my feelings inside.  I could share them with Maren, and she was incredibly receptive.  I didn’t have to lie about who I was, or leave details out.  Maren made me feel like I was a good person.  I told her about my past, and she seemed genuinely concerned for me.  She tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things I have been told about myself.  She told me that I was attractive, something I had never been told before, not even by Starr, who I was together with for ten years.  I was happy with who I was at that time.  Prior to that I had never willingly taken a picture of myself.  But with her, we would send each other snapchat pictures, and she made me feel like I wasn’t the hideous person that I thought myself to be.  In hindsight, I am sure that she was just being nice to me, and that she did not actually think I was attractive.  It was still nice to hear it, though.\n",
        "\n",
        "I miss those days.  I long for them to return, but I know that that will never happen.  The same thing has happened with many people before, though none to that extreme.  They are fine with me when we first start talking, and eventually they realise how high-maintenance and fucked up I am.  That causes them to drift away, until eventually we stop talking altogether, or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives.  That was the case with Starr.  The night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me.  In the morning, she told me it was over and a few weeks later told me to never talk to her again.  After ten years of being together, she ended it on a whim, and caused me to lose not only my significant other, but also my best friend.  The same thing is happening with Maren.  I am driving her away, and eventually I will not have a best friend again.  I will be completely alone.  The last time I was completely alone, right after Starr broke up with me, I didn’t leave my room for two weeks.  I didn’t eat a single thing in those two weeks.  I laid there in bed, staring at my ceiling in the darkness, constantly in tears, trying to realise where I had gone wrong.  I have never cried so much in my life.  I have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life, but at that moment I could not contain them any longer.  I had absolutely nothing left for me in the world, and that is how I feel again, right now.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was complete luck that I was actually able to reconnect with Maren again.  I have no idea at all how to make friends.  She just happened to be online on Facebook when I was feeling at my absolute lowest.  I sent her a message with no expectations whatsoever, I was prepared to either be completely ignored, or told to go away.  That didn’t happen though.  We had a wonderful conversation, reminiscing about our childhood.  I don’t remember how the subject got changed to me talking about Starr, but I told her everything, and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it.  She stayed up with me until the morning, just talking with me on Facebook.  I was in tears for most of that conversation, partly because I was still upset about the breakup, but also because I couldn’t believe that someone actually cared.  Especially someone I hadn’t talked to in over a decade.  When we started to get close, and revealed our feelings for one another, we joked about how us reconnecting was a “red string of fate.”  I don’t believe in fate, but I also don’t think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment, when I felt like I had nothing left.  The problem lies in the fact that I will never be able to replicate that with anyone else.  I am incredibly socially awkward; I cannot make new friends at all.  In person I just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety.  Online, I just have nothing to say.  I am a boring person.  I have tried to make new friends on various subreddits, /r/r4r, /r/kikpals and the like.  I have talked to a few people who seemed nice, but none of them developed into an actual friendship.  They all stopped talking to me after one session.  I don’t have anything at all to give in a friendship.\n",
        "\n",
        "After fighting with Maren, and being told that I can’t keep badgering her to hang out with me, when all I asked was that if she was going to be able to talk after she was done watching Game of Thrones with her new boyfriend (who was her ex,) my self-worth is absolutely rock bottom.  She has made me realise that I am the problem, that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve.  She joined me in blaming Starr for the dissolution of our relationship, but I see now that it was never her fault.  I am just completely unlovable.  I can never have more than one true friend.  I believe this stems from the fact that growing up, I had very few friends, and when I tried to expand and make new friends I got burned very badly, every time.  Because of this, I latch on to the one friend I have.  I suffocate them.  I bother them until they cannot stand it any more, and leave me.  I have tried so hard to give her space, and not ask her to hang out with me, or talk to me, but whenever I try, I get extremely depressed.  I have spent the past two weeks in extreme depression.  I was hoping that by the weekend we would be able to hang out and it would alleviate some of it, but she cancelled our plans in favour of hanging out with someone else.  Every time I ask her to do something and she says no, I get a sinking feeling.  Mainly because in the four months that I was happy, we did everything together.  Any time I asked if she wanted to do something, she was happy to hang out with me.  She was happy to talk to me nearly every moment she was awake.  I suppose that is only sustainable for so long until someone would get bored of me.  I have very little to offer, it was mainly her driving everything, and that must have been exhausting.\n",

For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. Deep in the land of Mordor, in the Fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a master ring, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.\n",

Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its time had come. It abandoned Gollum, but then something happened that the Ring did not intend.

Everyone is dating, some are already married with people they love. I get PMs from one of my friends from high school asking me if I've started dating yet. I keep trying to explain to him that I'm trying but not having any luck. Whenever dating comes up, that's all I ever get \"I'm sure you'll find someone eventually.\" Thing is, none of the \"I'd might be happy if...\" things before have obviously failed, but this is the only change left I can make, since professional and medical help has failed.\n",

        "Suicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better. The logic I mean with \"get better\" is that zero is still larger than a negative number, so I'd be better off. I used to think \"Ok, I'll wait until I turn 30, and then I'll kill myself if things haven't improved.\" However, as things have deteriorated, I've moved that up to 25. More recently, I've moved it up to after graduation (I'm thinking It could be my own graduation present to myself). I don't even know how I'm going to make it that far.

I get to continue hurting tomorrow? The only end this seems to lead to is \"why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum?\" I don't see the appeal in it. I think once I do it, I'll go out to a nice secluded part of one of my local national parks I like and shoot myself in the head really late at night. Nobody would notice I'm gone, possibly for a few weeks, nobody would hear a thing, I might not even be found. My body can feed some scavengers, I don't have to hurt anymore, people who love me don't have to see me hurt anymore, everyone wins. I've been dead inside for years, its just taking the rest of me a while to catch up. Of course, this is still likely a few years away, so I'm probably not at immediate risk of killing myself.\n",

        "I'm convinced my math teacher hates me I've been struggling with math and it's tough for.me my teacher knows that but still gets mad when I can't  get the answer to a question and embarrass me in the middle of class. Then there are my grades I had a c in math and progress reports where going out you only get one if you have a d grade or lower but my teacher gave one to me. And ingot in trouble because my parents expect at least a b. Then last week we had a test. I was getting my grades up I was almost to a b but then I notice I see a day later my grade went down by almost 30 points. And  I thought I did well I knew for a fact I passed that test. I double checked my answers triple checked I had to have at least got most right. But then I see I have an f now. The test wasn't even 30 points. Now I'm screwed the quarters almost over and the home work which is most of our grade is only Worth one point IF my teacher grades it sometimes he \"forgets\" so it's pretty much impossible to get your grade up. And his response to asking about my grade is do your work. Pretending I don't turn in all of my work on time. I'm so stressed out 8th grade sucks I hate it. Everyone's mean and distant the more I grow up and my grades can't stay up. I'm going to fucking implode.\n",

He was hungup on an ex girlfriend and when he talked about her it would hurt me each time, I felt like I would never be good enough compared to her. Why was she good enough for him to date but not me? It messed me up so much. He would say things like \"I would be the luckiest guy if you were my girlfriend\" or 'you would be the perfect girlfriend\". At the same time he would brush off discussions I've tried to have about relationships and would say \"you deserve a nice boyfriend\" and things like that. The whole ordeal made me feel awful about myself and I have been in such a depression. We still text but I don't try to have serious conversations anymore since he moved for his job anyways.
